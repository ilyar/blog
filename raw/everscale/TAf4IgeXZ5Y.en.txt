oh we're live
you see
mine still
i'm still
on the uh
play card screen
mine hasn't started
am i the only one
i have black skin
screen
yeah
it's not blank i mean i see the logo and
everything but um
it hasn't started
yeah uh
unfortunately yeah link
has been updated yeah
uh okay all right so there's we have a
new link oh gee all right
that's the last minute
the thing that's not good all right
just while we're talking just throw the
youtube link in all the chats so
everybody can
come here i see it
yeah now i see it
um okay
that sucks anyway all right um i guess
we can begin so
hi everybody uh welcome to everscale
community column number 93 uh glad you
can join us
we have
a lot of really really interesting stuff
to share today um particularly there's a
presentation from some of the ever scale
uh startup competition winners uh which
uh uh
whoever doesn't have their microphone on
mute if you could mute that'd be great
all right um yeah so we have some
presentations from everscale uh startup
competition winners
uh
which i'm personally looking forward to
that should be very interesting uh we
also have an update
to the nft alliance uh proposal um that
has gone through
several rounds of scrutiny so i think uh
there will be some interesting things
there and we'll hear about all of it so
let me just first do what i usually do
which is sort of lay down the groundwork
for the call
uh so unless you're i don't know
tunneling your way out of prison or
playing hide the salami
please turn your cameras on
please save your questions until each
presenter is finished and please use the
raise hand feature in zoom to do so that
would be really really appreciated let's
not just shout things out
uh if you are watching us on youtube you
can leave a comment in the thread and we
will get to it at the end of the call
and uh just a friendly reminder the call
is conducted in english only so let's go
ahead and kick things off like we
usually do with our beloved cherished
network and technical updates so mita if
you'd like to start that'd be great
now we don't have technical updates
because um
many
our of our team members
uh having difficulties and performing
their duties currently
and
both
both technically and morally
so
that will definitely
maybe
uh
like delay
many things
on technical side
we're trying to
like uh work
and thus in this circumstances
but as it is
um increasingly
harder to do
we are
trying to relocate as many people as
possible
from russia
to
um whenever we have russian developers
um
from russia
and um that is an
ongoing effort both for
everex and
um
and kwpc as well kwpc will relocate all
its stuff from russia
in coming days
um
so that definitely causing some some
delays
on many many
many many fronts
um
it's the same thing goes for prevent the
team which i'm in constant contact with
which also going to relocate their
people out of russia as soon as possible
and
they will also having difficulties of
course to perform right now
um
[Music]
the
um
apart from that
personally
i'm starting a project which called
train to trannai
or tnt for short
and that project will be about
a fund
it's a decentralized way
to predict
certain events
that the community wants to happen
such event can be for example
that we all want
some building to be built
and we're doing something
in the prediction market when we say
what date this building will be built on
another way to use it for example if we
have some politician we don't like
we can predict the date he's going out
of office
and we can place a large bet on the date
that it will happen
and if someone predicted correctly the
date
which this politician for example
has ended his beauty duties
then this person who predicted it
correctly
is rewarded handsomely
for example if we know when
certain politician will finish his duty
as a president of some country
in a particular date
and he bet on this date
then in return he can get for example
100 million dollars
thank you
all right is that all
yep all right thank you very much mita
sorry i apologize i spilled coffee on my
mouse
that happens sometimes
um all right uh moving right along uh so
um we
uh if you remember uh michael gord from
gda capital um has come on this uh call
quite a few times um thank you michael
if you're if you're watching
and uh talked about the everscale
startup competition i know it was called
the free ton startup competition but uh
and
obviously we rebranded some time ago
it's the everest uh everscale startup
competition now
and uh there were winners of that
competition and we have two of them with
us today
um the first is a dream base that's
a s d-r-a-m-e-b-a-s-e and the second is
combo space
so
um first we're gonna welcome uh alofa
flusso i hope i'm not uh completely
butchering your name and if i am i'm
i'm known for that so i apologize but uh
drain base is basically africa's uh
first
decentralized streaming media platform
so
to an extent the the youtube of africa
if you will which is
pretty huge i mean i don't think i need
to explain how cool that is so i'm going
to pass things off to you alofa
um so please tell us about your project
iron
hi hi everyone pleasure to meet you meet
you
all right guys thank you so much for the
opportunity first of all thank you for
the opportunity to be on your caton and
of course
thank you for the opportunity given to
me to tell the community about our
project
so yeah like he said um dream base is um
africa's first decentralized music
streaming platform
we're trying to take music streaming
from you know
from the normal web 2 to web theory
the media data mining industry is like
billions of dollar industries and we're
trying to see and then of course music
streaming takes uh about sixty-two
percent of the
of that particular market shared and
we're trying to
see how we can actually use blockchain
you know
to make things better in that particular
industry so what is at least dreambase
dreambase is a major instrument platform
you can stream
your music there as an artist you can
stream your video there as an artist and
of course you can even meet your
contents as an nfts that's like our end
we can you meet your content as anything
on the platform
what are the major things that we're
trying to solve you're trying to solve
the problem of transparency
trying to solve the problem of copyright
infringement of course using ipfs you
all know that uh
that there will be no issue with
copyright because one of the things we
noticed on traditional streaming
platform is the fact that
artists lose a lot of a lot of revenues
from copyright improvement when a
particular content is posted on youtube
some guy just takes the downloads it
takes it to his site and then brings you
know traffic to your own site and of
course the artists
actually use this money to produce the
music is going to be losing a lot
from uh those copyright issues and of
course transparency issue
artists don't know how much they are
aiming
they just get credited a particular
amount i think
the way youtuber does it
by a particular number of stream you get
this particular amount and then possibly
say they pay them probably monthly uh
you know at a particular period but they
were trying to solve that issue because
some of them don't even know
exactly how much they're earning from
their music so that's one of the
problems
intends to solve of course using smart
contracts
everything is transparent you can check
how much it's been debited from the
customers and of course how much is
going to the platform how much is good
straight to your own personal wallet
that's one of the issues we are trying
to
solve i know of course
there wouldn't be no payment at the end
of the month the smart contract executed
such that as it's deducting
tokens from the customers it's paying
the artist uh immediately
and of course there will be some extra
features that would be added to
to make it different from any
traditional streaming platform
music i'm listening to music listening
as a video people that are streaming
videos they can end by listening to
music
you can come up with a very clear
playlist and then for people using that
particular playlist the more users of
that particular playlist the more you
can actually get to you know end
something so i'm very sure it's a
future it's one of the features we found
out from feedbacks that
most of our users would get to live
because they get to just end by
listening
you know listening to
to music and of course
one of the other features to be
introducing is the fact that artists
will be able to get funded by their
listeners
take for instance some artists out there
actually do not have the funds to pull
out some music that i'm coming to
upcoming artists now
they have the opportunity to be funded
by their listeners the listeners can
crowdfund a particular project a
particular album a particular single
just you know what to do
supporting their favorite artists and of
course the smart questions can also be
urged in such a way that
people that invest in a particular
artist can get a return when the music
gets to be streamed
it depends on what the fans want it
depends on what the artist wants if the
artist wants to be quiet for that just
because it is their favorite artist that
works and of course if you is as a sort
of investment where the listener gets to
get back it can also work in a
particular way so that's more like what
jbs is all about we are just making
music streaming content streaming
decentralized
basically i don't know
if i should if i need to share like use
the interface of the app it's not
necessary if you'd like to you can
certainly go ahead if you'd like to
share your screen absolutely no problem
do that
you can visit our website dreambase.com
d-r-a-m-e-b
dot com you can download that white
paper
to read through and of course you do
have any suggestions please can you
don't necessity to
meant to send you of course you're
making it decentralized so of course
your inputs are would be very important
if there's a future you like on a
platform like that before we start from
africa to go global we don't intend to
limit to africa but since
it's a market that requires you actually
getting that contact to the artist
that's why
we need to start your speech you're
familiar with
can you see my screen now
uh let's see
yep we can
we're seeing
we see you
all right there it is using my screen
now we did i see it's gonna be
this this is when you download the app
of course you get to
you have a welcome page so
move forward
you can either sign up as a listener or
you can sign up as an artist
so i'm going to be signing it as a
listener for for this
demo so you put in your username your
password your data about your country of
course so that we can give you contents
that particular to your area
you can sign up you get a confirmation
continue
login again
and you can of course will be
integrating other apis you want to use
your google or your facebook
to log in
you select the kind of music you think
you'd like to listen to jazz reggae soul
gospel r b
and of course you select your favorite
artist artists do you want their content
to pokemon your
page and all of that
you can do it next
and of course like i said you you
setting up what
wallet
put in your mail your password set up
your letter mostly username you have
your wallets you can see your wallet
balance know how much token you say i've
let
when you make a particular subscription
and make a particular donation
then you can get to your own
we have the video section
we have the music session we have the
literature section where you have people
artists or content creators meet their
short stories frames as nfcs and of
course we have
more graphic ones the graphic um
pictures as that is
you can check your settings your
username your password in case you need
to change any of that
well let's check your balance
and then one of the features that we'll
be bringing again is more like a
community
for a particular um music for a
particular album an artist or a listener
could decide to create a group chat
where people can come to interact and
discuss you know like topics like
interest
so we'll be having sort of like a good
chat community group chat for
music for a particular music video
not just a general random comment
session
and of course your just is more like
your library and all of that so
that's more like what the interface is
going to be
looking at i'm going to be showing you
what in fact you should be looking at if
you're logging in as a
as an artist
so signing up as an artist when you have
a
normal login details country
their
accounts continue you log in back into
your account
select the kind of music people should
be estimating from you and of course age
rating you need to select so that we
could you know
limit the kind of content some people
would be
that listener should be seen of course
when you're registering as a listener
you'll be putting your age so that not
just any context will be flying around
um young
people's pages and then you put your
instagram page your twitter page
um your social media pages that's for
the artist so that you can connect
of course you create your wallet where
you'll be getting your returns
you come to your home
you can see the things you've uploaded
this is more like a upload button for
the artist
your album is your singles
wallet
community tool
and of course you have a dashboard where
you've seen how your music or your album
is doing you're saying okay which album
is generating more money which music is
generating more money and all of that so
that is what dream business is all about
um i'll stop sharing my screen this
moment
so i'll be open to answer any questions
you might have i don't know if that
would be now right
i love it thank you so much that's uh
that's fantastic you guys are doing an
excellent job uh very interesting does
anybody have a question
i would love to ask coron if you don't
mind i don't mind thank you very much
this is this is great this is amazing
and i'm particularly excited that you're
from africa because we have a passionate
community in africa of about 500 people
judging by the chat they did a couple of
hackathons
and they're now working on
an ft marketplace
based on everscale which is about we
they're presenting next tuesday and it's
about to be released maybe four weeks
from now
question i saw new website that you guys
do in ft maintain as well so that's
ethereum based or uh what do you do
around nfts if you could elaborate on
that a little bit
i said you know getting elastic yes yes
if you could just elaborate a little bit
on your nft
functionality
non-fungible tokens
what what can be done uh with nfts on
your platform because i saw it on the
website that you have nft minton
okay okay that's not like the age group
so for now we're starting with music and
videos streaming but of course some
persons would like to share their
content when it comes to art too so that
is where nfc comes in and when it comes
to music too as i someone people to
stream
we've had a case
where i think recently a particular
artist means
music to about ten thousand copies of
music just to sell it
so
the situation is where he does not want
to stream he just wants to sell the
music so like but like an sqc bond
jimbo is going to be making that
possible
i'm not did i answer alexander
yep yeah you did
there might be synergies with the
marketplace initiative of the african
community so we might i know wrong if
you could maybe link up with john just
to explore synergies yeah absolutely
absolutely there's
there are some other projects alofa that
are that are actually underway nft
projects that would
uh
that i think could could partner and do
some really good things with this um
the idea that you have is wonderful
but we probably there's there's some
value adds that we can we can bring um
that would that would make sense so
we'll talk off uh offline again and uh
and i'll sort of tell you a few of those
those projects so i think
i think it's wonderful
okay
thank you thank you very much uh if
there's no more questions let's go to
our next uh uh startup competition
winner uh his name's uh anut nagar again
i'm sorry i'm famous for butchering
names but uh uh anudit is from convo
space uh convo space is
it's basically a decentralized
conversation layer social
uh conversation layer for uh for mobile
apps for websites for nfts
for um wallets for blogs i mean it's
really really cool so i knew that if
you'd like
please tell us a little more absolutely
um hey everyone thanks a lot for the
wonderful introduction wrong and uh i'm
another night and we're currently
pulling out the convo
oops is it is it me um
space is aimed to be this decentralized
conversation layer
i think it's just me i think it's just
me
i think this should be better um so
convo space is geared towards being this
decentralized conversation layer with
which you can interact on
any website from anywhere you are in a
completely decentralized manner the
thinking behind that is just the fact
that
let's say if you just
whatever i present to you in the next 10
minutes or so it's like so amazing that
you can't contain yourself just want to
shout it out to the world how would you
go about doing that
well you you're gonna have to
leave this meeting and switch to a
different application whatever way you
decide
and that's where the kind of gap that we
have in terms of where we see content
and where we
actually share it and with converse
space we're trying to break down those
barriers
and allowing anyone to build on top of
it i mean the only reason why like unit
swap at maker dow are such big projects
is the fact that they open up all of
that financial liquidity for anyone to
be able to build on top of it
but the liquidity for social platforms
are really the conversations that are
happening on those platforms so if you
can make those conversations composable
across the web this is open this whole
new host of composability for like
social layers into any applications
that's what we're building out
let me just share my screen and dive
right in
i hope my screen is visible
and uh the core idea is just that leave
a message on wherever you wherever you
are just a single enough code to spin up
a conversation around really any element
of the web
instantly send it to wherever you are
but let's say if you just moved away
from your computer and just have like
telegram on your phone and you want to
tap into that same conversation you can
switch back to that leave a message over
there saying hey ever still
send that message and converse space
will automatically sync up all of those
conversations and interactions wherever
you are as soon as you back to the
computer you'll get that same message on
that same tab on whatever blockchain
you're on all decentralized and all
powered by karma space
so that you don't really have to juggle
multiple different social platforms
wherever you are combo spaces is an easy
way of being able to communicate with
your team
but at the same time through whatever
blockchain you write whether it might be
freetown everscale or connected to even
just ethereum you can just log in with
your wallet and be able to view all your
messages across the web
in a single place whatever kinds of
threads they might be be able to manage
like your identity and reputation data
across the ecosystem
but the cool part about just being able
to own your data is the fact that you
can just go back to the data section
download all your data tokenize it but
also just delete it from every single
interface and really just go anonymous
within a click of a button that's the
kind of power that you want to give
developers and platforms to be able to
just have a social layer with which you
can like anchor a conversation to an nfp
so that wherever the nft goes
conversations around those artworks four
artists can along the web you can tie it
to a blog you can tie it to an fp really
anything that is uniquely identifiable
on the web
and all you really need is
grabbing an api key from the platform
and you're good to go
that's just a quick dldr of what we're
building out at combat space love to get
your thoughts on it thanks a lot
wow thank you that was uh that was an
excellent presentation
uh
does anybody have a question for a
nudity by the way am i am i pronouncing
your name correctly yep you got it both
okay good
that's that's the first
um
that's uh that's
that's really really cool um how far
along are you is it is is everything
already working is it already yeah it's
it's already live people can get started
working right now as of this moment and
uh yeah yeah um so it's been very cool
sort of integrating even with everscale
and freedom and uh yeah we just had
awesome fun during the hackathon
fantastic just great
well um i don't see any hands raised so
yeah i do i don't have a question okay
i don't i don't see where i can connect
the ever scale
um it's freedom oh free time
change the name yet yeah yeah yeah we i
i told i i talked to michael and
everybody it'll it'll be you know
they'll change it
that
yep all right
okay i knew it thank you very much thank
you for coming let's
absolutely glad come back uh every week
if you can um
let's go to our next presenter uh we're
gonna welcome back marina from i.t gold
i think everybody remembers marina uh
since uh the last time as i mentioned
earlier uh we had the presentation for
the nft alliance proposal uh
it's been
through a fine-tooth comb
including by some of the people on this
call so uh there are updates and i think
we'd love to know what they are marina
if you're ready we'd love to hear it
hi everyone
hi i will now briefly go through the
updates of the nft alliance and firstly
i should say that one of the main goals
of the alliance nft standardization is
almost achieved we expect it to be voted
in the nearest 10 days and the code of
course will be available to everybody in
the github repository
some changes also
occurred
have also cured the composition of the
alliance members
uh to these moments members of alliance
are grand bazaar
everyx with just nifty com tonium with
nf nefertiti dot io skill punks
and most expensive dot io
there are several associated members of
alliance
uh if i can say so these are nft wiki
don loot nft
said place and new miss
and um
broxis and id gold i all stay as um
technology partners of nft alliance
then considering the proposal itself
several significant developments have
been done
and the first
is that we've set up the concrete kpi
metrics for the marketing activities
which at the end of 2022 should cover
more than
12 million users of a target audience
attract
130 000 new users accounts
in the network
and attract
or generate maybe
1.65 million new transactions
sorry
we've also determined yeah i'm sorry is
it possible uh all of it to
your microphone
um
yum
is this sound okay
can you hear me yeah yeah we could hear
you fine you're great well okay good
um well we've also determined uh the
kpis for achieving a certain number of
active nfd of a scale community users in
social media accounts like twitter
discord and telegram of course
considering the creators program that
been presented in the
first version of proposal it has been
developed
to
what we call creators fund
which relates to purchasing the rights
and the or i mean copyrights and um
audience from the epic creators who
really have their contact and audience
takenization of this um
content and further sale off uh this of
their contact in the form of nft
to
achieve these tasks we plan to establish
this creator's fund with stablecoin
assets
which will be invested in such creators
rights
and to support such investments and
prove participants interests we propose
to support investors feared
with 100 percent match in evers logged
by existing uh network staking
mechanisms for significant
um with a with a significant um lock
period
uh for two or three years something like
that
and the alliance itself will collect the
margin from the sale of these nfts
of uh which will be then returned
and turned into alliance marketing
activities
well farming program
presented earlier was also they updated
and reformed into
liquidity program
uh
which means that to attract investors to
actively participate in nfd market
and
[Music]
we we propose to support major nft
projects based on everscale with an
additional liquidity for their own tip 3
tokens listed on ever scale decks
like tonswab or flax
and
the program will match with documented
and confirmable revenue of nft's
collections public sale price
and
if i can say so
the
amount of
this token ever pair or liquidity
or it will
will be based on
on the projects to economics
so
yes these are the major
um updates
that we've
we can present now
that is
maybe all
if someone has questions i will try to
answer gladly
thank you
thank you marina thank you very much
uh i don't see hands race but does
anybody have a question
well those are major updates and i i
hope i i know um
i know mita you've gone through this uh
i know some of the folks glad you've
gone through this um and i think i think
now it's looking like uh like
at least
in an informal method a certain
consensus has been reached and i think
everybody should be happy with it we'd
love to see the final version of course
uh uh on the forum anywhere else you
could put it and i think yeah i mean
sounds like uh sounds like it's uh it's
much better than the original
so
yeah thanks i hope good yes yes
all right marina thank you very much
thank you for your presentation uh let's
uh move on to our final segment we're
making really good time which i'm very
happy about so it's our closing segment
um
all right hang on
i always do this i gotta stop doing it
but i'm gonna do it anyway then um his
lickety-split lip with a hipster's pimp
ben
yeah i i wanted to i wanted to make it
englishy so
very bloody very very blighty nice yeah
uh yeah so um a few things for you this
week obviously there's been a lot going
on so i think um it's been
a few i could have mentioned but these
are the top ones from this week
uh five uh i don't know if it's been
noticed but fida the international chess
federation have actually started uh
quite a big campaign of
advertising everscale um we're in the
background of all their tournaments and
a lot of stuff going on there now
so that's definitely good news they'll
increase visibility
uh the hacker new decentralized internet
rising contest uh we had another month
full of winners i believe one of the
winners this month came from within the
community it was a really good article
as well to be honest so uh hats off to
you sir
um again always worth checking out lots
of very cool stuff goes on through there
um i've seen that stuff for a while so
hopefully we'll uh try and get him back
on i imagine one of the weeks soon to
update us
uh the chess nft uh tournament happened
on sunday and
it was good fun um there was a good
couple of dozen people turned up uh
there was a chess grand master i didn't
get a chance to play the uh chess
grandmaster myself
um but yeah i did beat a couple of you
right i know who you are um got beat by
a couple of you too so all's fair but
i'm really looking forward to the next
one that was that was a lot of fun so
again well done to the chess nft.com
team and all that
and finally as we mentioned at the top
of the call before we went live on
youtube never mind the going jerry
we did episode two last night it was a
lot of fun we had amy tom from
hackernoon uh dion jumped off the uh
score keeping to the panel so yeah it
was a bit competitive yeah a lot lots of
fun so i'm gonna try and edit that and
get a good quick turnaround on it and
get some sort of a teaser out for you
tonight maybe early tomorrow
and that's my bits for this week thank
you very much everyone
and juicy as they were thank you very
much
lickety-split lip that's that's exactly
i'm going to call you that that's going
to be your nickname lickety-split
thank you ben uh let's see we're going
to
we don't have any questions from youtube
but i think that's probably because we
had a little bit of a slip up at the
beginning youtube was giving us a little
bit of problems
and we had to
send everybody a new link so normally we
would have a bunch but today we don't
and because of it we're making great
time but we do have a um
we do have a question that was written
in and uh
uh i believe this one is for you uh
somebody's asking i'd be happy for some
kind of an explanation about the
proposal that passed to support uh fair
playing validators
what's the problem what's been decided
and how does uh how does it solve uh the
problem
you're with
us by the left
no bible's here
i don't know
we can't hear you
microphone's on
right
let me take a stab at it then um so
essentially uh what happened was
it was identified there were some very
specific validators and i'm not going to
name them because it's just that's not
what we do here
that
colluded in a way where they
owned
all of the
access
to the d pools um of validators that
were not them
basically so
um
essentially they centralized their uh
their their validation and they did so
uh with uh malicious intent in mind and
that intent was to
uh
use the rewards that they receive uh so
that they can turn around and dump it on
the open market and sell them and
in effect depress the price so
uh for a lot of you who've been asking
questions
um hold on
yeah i hear you well
we can't hear you
unfortunately
or is it just me
that's a possibility no wrong nobody
hears pablo maybe those validators heck
of course but you said it man that thing
would happen i mean so yeah they
colluded
collusion yeah yeah it was a collusion
um you can call it an attack or you can
call it just just just just
you know uh being
um but which whichever you call it they
basically uh owned a bunch of uh
validators uh
ability to validate and they
used it against the network because
they're
that's what do
so uh what this does is it creates a
reward system uh in state a staking
reward system
for those who are not them
and in doing so it will essentially keep
those particular validators who are not
going to get any part of that reward
from being able to validate
simple solution and of course over time
all of those sticking words they come
back into the system um they're returned
over a period of time
and problem solved hopefully so that's
the idea behind it um i don't know if uh
you have another question if you do uh
you can probably send it to the
validators chat you can send it to any
community chat we'll train this or you
can send it directly to me i'll i'll get
you an answer to them uh
anything to add alex anybody
i think right
sorry
well wrong i think
we'll have a healthy network as a result
of this
as simple as this
holy cow we have set a new everscale
record we have finished in the 45
minutes i do believe this is the fastest
call we ever had and the content
involved was super awesome by everybody
who joined thank you so much for doing
it
last call for
anything comments questions yes no maybe
so maybe rain maybe snow
alex
yeah maybe maybe just another quick
update from me um
the um
ever x finalized a while ago actually
integration with the
chinese bsn blockchain network
but uh it was just announced basically
today it's on twitter so please feel
free to retweet
going to put it in the chats i guess and
also the chinese community of everskill
made the decision to support the chinese
nft standard
called ddc if i'm not mistaken
um
so they're basically going ahead and
doing this so very soon besides uh
integration at the blockchain level will
also integrate
with the nft standard which i think
opens up a lot of opportunities
uh in the you know obviously large
segment where
also those nfts are going to be treated
separately from the chinese crypto
legislation being fully legitimate so i
thought that was good news to share
since it was formally announced today
thank you and actually i i want to ask
you you you made a a comment uh
yesterday
on the on one of the uh our uh one of
the chats
about uh the community and i think it i
think a lot of people were confused
about exactly what it was maybe just
just one minute about what exactly you
were trying to convey
sure sure look it was a little bit of
misunderstanding and i just i shouldn't
have copy pasted the chat so basically
there is believe it or not there is an
international community of auditors
internal auditors risk managers etc like
i know 5 000 people something like that
who decided to
launch their own token called risk i
don't like the name but that's a whole
separate subject
and they did on every scale
and basically they want to utilize the
token as part of their governance
mechanics etc etc so they that's what
they did and i'm
i'm
i'm i was in the chat where they
announced that they're closing the chat
uh and move into a more technologically
advanced platform and also renounce the
token
and to be honest i just didn't notice
that paragraph about
deleting the chat so when i copy pasted
that the community saw that i was
suggesting to delete the whole community
chat
and i'm thankful how humble people are
because they said
okay fine bad luck you know is it going
to be at least you know archived
and there's like what does he mean what
the hell is going on so
the point the bottom line is never copy
paste uh the thing or if you do kind of
read it twice and then
delete what's obviously not relevant or
potentially misleading which is
something with a which i haven't done it
was midnight so
yeah
so it's let's let's call it fun sorry
for putting on the spot
no problem no problem all right so that
clears that up yeah yeah
but the good news is that
can can did you did you hear what i said
the community of internal auditors and
uh and risk managers in international uh
european i believe will have their own
token now we'll play with some
governance mechanics uh
uh with our own token i think token is
totally liquid so don't take it as an
investment advice for sure it's worth
nothing and might not worsen but for me
it was more important that we got that
community attention and they're thinking
about blockchain
um as part of their uh governance
that's that was the message that i was
supposed to share last night
well you shared it now and i think that
uh pretty much lays everything any
contradictions to us thank you alex all
right
uh look everybody thank you for coming
um have a wonderful wonderful rest of
your week um
i know geopolitically there's a lot of
stuff going on let's just remember
we aren't politicians we don't divide we
unite that is what we do
so just keep on chugging keep on working
and let's make every scale change
everything just like my linkedin page
says
we're here to change everything we're
not here to
to divide people so
love you all
see you next week please come and please
tell
others who want to say something on this
call to come as well
cheers
thank you
bye yes
thanks bye
