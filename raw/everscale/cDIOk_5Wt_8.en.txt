hi pavel
hello
so waiting everybody to join
people coming in now
yeah
hi everybody
so how many people are we expecting to
join the call here
see a lot a lot of mean people
i think it's going to be youtube mostly
because the zoom link was not really
circulated
well we've got nine people on the call
do we want to circulate it
it's dangerous
hello
hello hello
for those killer whales or short
elephants that you have on the
background yeah
oh
john can you say anything
yeah i hear you you can't hear okay we
can't hear
anything
oh i heard him
oh yeah i didn't know i heard him too
one two three
four five six
alright
they're orcas
those are killer whales killer whales
that's what they're in a pod
they're in a pot right now they're in a
pod right now yeah
killer whales
custom
correct
[Music]
how many espressos a day do you drink
it's the cough
just for the taste then
no not no no actually the
all the important ingredients for the
health are in the cafe the caffeinator
as well is normal coffee it's not a
coffee
for men particularly
if you know what i mean
like an aphrodisiac type of thing or uh
i was thinking hair or something
what did you think
hair
i don't know why well
because of me
[Laughter]
okay it must be here
you don't see everything
there are some things
about the left mysterious
region man a mystery
right
so
three minutes after
do you think we should start
wait another minute
yep absolutely i think okay
cool okay well welcome hi everybody i'm
joanne from everex and welcome to the
first gosh ama where
all of your burning questions shall be
answered finally
we have michael goreszewski the cto of
everex and co-founder of gosh
the subject of today and he's here with
us to
field all of the questions
and the pressures on you meecha so would
you like to kick it off with a few words
sure well um
first of all i mean um amazing interest
from everyone i'm surprised
um so i don't know
maybe just say two to three words about
gosh so we launched a closed network
based on every scale um
which was tuned to um to support
gitonchain
and
i can show you i mean you probably
did go and check but if you didn't
then
there is a
nice website
and now also includes the introduction
that we made on the
on the dockercon
to the the gosh so so you can watch the
video here and basically it's a bit sad
then you have a documentation about gosh
here it's in the docs section and you
have um gosh app
which actually
is
just give you gives you the possibility
to use this first version of gauche
repositories
and uh you know you can go
for example browse summary pro some
repositories like gosh
for example
yeah and here is the gauche repository
on gosh
um
and
there are some some familiar face it
looks like github it actually github
compliant
um fully so you use your git client to
to browse that browse the repositories
to work with repositories to push there
is a special
git remote that we need to just install
follow the commutation you can you can
use this right now it's not optimized
yet it's a very very early
stage
so uh it's a long way to go still
but uh but it's already it works i mean
you can you can use it you can try it
don't uh put your live repositories in
it yet because of my restart
and might lose all the all the data
so it's just for experiments now
but they are quite important experiments
because gosh is solving two problems
first
the decentralization of the code
as with each repository actually there
is there is a dow created
you can see here there is a detail about
dao
and there are events which are well not
in this repository but anyway you can
see if you go to the repositories there
are some events but you can browse that
test events for example merge commits
and there are there are dow voting for
this merge commits
so you can actually like the the dow is
deployed immediately when you create
repository
so um
so so that is that is in the second one
is is the is the security
and security is the software uh
secure software supply chain
um and secure software supply chain is a
big problem right now particularly for
uh like
you know mission critical applications
and big corporations as well
uh and blockchain applications for for
certain we can see that right now with
upgrades to the to the network and how
we struggle with that if we would have
gosh and we will have gosh we will move
all repositories of of the of the
bricks to gauche
soon once it will be production stable
ready
um and which is expected within three
months i think
and and then uh and then we will be able
to secure the delivery of the node uh to
the to the network as well through this
uh through this thing
so yeah that's this is just
just a quick overview
of what cautious
and
the network that
has been started is again is a closed
network uh and the reasons
for for this uh
being started like this is first of all
there is um
economic i would say
reasons because um it it takes right now
enormous amounts of gas to to do that
all that
and because
this thing competes with
or kind of
will compete with github and gitlab at
least on paper meaning that
the developer
are not expecting to pay gas for
creating every commit
they're not going to do that very simply
and um
so it is impossible to launch it on the
for example everscale or any other
blockchain in in
to the to the respect of the business
model of the blockchain which currently
exists and as you know the business
model of the blockchain every blockchain
in existence today
is that you pay for except for eos maybe
but
still it's even with eos you have to you
have to deposit bond
so that you need to pay money up front
basically
and
that's a show stopper for application
like
giton chain
and
you cannot
kind of shortcut it you cannot uh you
cannot go around this you cannot tweak
the network to to support this
if you go on uh
gosh uh
network explorer right now you will see
one trillion tokens
there
and this one trillion tokens basically
because with each
wallet on each repository we deposit 10
tokens
and by the way they are not gauche
tokens okay they're just they call shell
stable coin tokens in the future but
right now
it's just it's just tokens and these
tokens are deposited automatically and
they are not um
they're not transferable
they only can pay for gauss repositories
and and they pay gas and and 10 000
because we need them all
so you can you can just make a
calculation very simply why it was from
this standpoint why it was absolutely
impossible to launch it on the main
network of everscale
because we simply would not have enough
tokens in existence today to pay to pay
for all that um
so so
and you know and who would do that
it requires a very different set of um
tokenomic rules
uh all around
and the tokenomics of this network when
once it's launched
it uh it will
just be
very
kind of
tuned to the to the application to the
business model of git basically
um
it will allow for example free
repositories right because that's what
you expect from git if your open source
repository today you you
you just deploy it
there
for free
so we need to do the same thing if we
want to be competitive in that respect
and
to be considered by by developers to
really use it
second of all
again it's very experimental and and the
the requirements for git on chain
also in technical requirements for
guitar
chain are quite different from any
contracts that we
have seen up until now
and um
it also puts some
some pressure on the network in the
places where
for example the validators of gauche
network right now has one terabyte
of
memory
uh it cost a lot of money to run this
validator uh like thousand dollars so
obviously
this requirement also could not be met
technically right now by every scale
in its current state because it's simply
because it's tuned to another and it
will take a lot of time for us to
kind of
work the network towards
when it would be able to sustain such an
application
and reduce this amount of memory for
example if if at all
oh that's the second reason then there
are other reasons including like
political reasons
the
if you see the gorge blockchain is
almost abstracted from the application
we put really emphasis on the
application itself and that's because we
want to
appeal to
what 12 13 million developers of docker
which are currently most of them of
course never worked in blockchain and
they don't know how to write smart
contracts or anything like that they
don't actually need to know even that
it's on the blockchain apart from the
fact that it's as secure as on the
blockchain
but
it's not the blockchain developers and
with gosh we want to appeal
to non-blockchain developers to give
them very simple tool they can use
familiar tool that they can use without
even thinking if it's a blockchain not
blockchain what blockchain
what tokens
they don't need to know any of that and
of course
this is very different from
uh starting another particular network
like ethereum or or whatever scale or so
on so apart from the from the
economics technic technology perspective
there is also this like marketing
psychology component where we simply
want to go away from not only from ever
scale blockchain but from all the
blockchains in terms of abstracting that
from the
end user completely
um
i think
that's enough for intro okay
okay great that was a fantastic overview
and i think you've actually answered
some or a lot of questions that have
been burning throughout the community
over the past few days um but to make
sure
yeah bye-bye we're done now
no
but um
i i think most people would agree that
it definitely is a beautiful website
there's a lot that has been done and a
lot of documentation and clearly there's
been so much work going on behind the
scenes and i think that's probably what
surprised people the most
to not have known that something so huge
was going on
um a very simple reason for that very
simple very simple precise reason for
that we were under nda with docker
that's it we could not
tell anything about that and yes it was
actually not on david's did that there
were uh three teams who who who did the
project with everex it was kwbc
who did all the work around they did the
websites we did
all the marketing work around that the
video production and all of that
and there was um
actually ivan's team
um who did the
out from ukraine who did the
um all the
web interface to
uh to gosh
so it was three teams who worked on that
and yes we were under strict mda we did
not tell anything before 10th of may
that's why
yep makes sense
okay i have been collecting a lot of
questions over the past few days um and
for anybody out there
if you're watching and you still want to
ask a question you could just hop on
youtube and ask in the chat or you can
ask in the everscale
uh community chat just hashtag gosh ama
and i could feel them
at the end
so
if you're ready miesha i can kick off
oh somebody already has a question
yes it's michael michael always has the
question it's uh it's okay
michael yeah hi guys uh
uh michael in simple words how will
every scale and will it benefit from the
gosh project and all the
work done
to make it happen
yeah there are several ways
uh the first of all
like
gosh runs on everscale
and
the
the what the developers that we want to
bring to gosh
it's a it's a huge community
which um will start first of all of
course without knowing
anything about blockchain and so on
but
in the roadmap actually you can see here
if you if you scroll down the screen
there is this
that part
which is not done yet
but
this part is one of the things that will
um
bring these developers into hopefully
into blockchain development
because to secure their cic descriptions
as you know cicd scripts are actually a
significant security hole right now
in the in the whole secure software
supply chain
paradigm
if we want to create a system where you
can build the scripts using smart
contracts and then of course securing
this smart contracts
using you know all the all the tools
that we have
so
in the process
these people these new developers will
be introduced to everscale technology
they will be introduced to everscale
smart contract team
and that will basically bring them to
every scale
um that's one thing and it's a it's a
it's a lot of developers
which are um you know
which are right now
no reason whatsoever to be exposed on to
the blockchain at all
right
um and we hope to make the gosh hope to
make that reason for them that's one
thing another thing more practical there
will be
there will be a staking program which
you can stake your
ever scales
ever sorry lock them
and
validate uh on gosh
with with some uh staking rewards and
gosh
that program
will
start
i think quite soon
actually
once we
are finished with the
[Music]
with the atomic swaps between
everscale and bosch
so there will be the gauche will be
connected to every scale and dominant
small contracts and you can easily be
able to easily lock tokens here lock
covers here get cautious there and and
and just take them
to
to validate and to get rewards
so and i think that's not the only but
that's that's just the first thing that
we will do
um
so yeah i think i think that uh
like
it will bring it should bring a lot of
attention i would say to the technology
into the network where
you don't need to be too afraid to
create really ambitious
stuff on it right
because gosh is probably the most
ambitious project ever created on any
blockchain in terms of like
what it requires from the blockchain
and the level of
kind of um
you know
end result
the application that might serve
millions of developers
i don't think
we have
even you know come close to
to implementing anything close to that
um on any on any blockchain or on every
scale for that respect so
um
that might put every scale on the map
big time
in terms of like really
why it is scalable right so when
developers create applications
uh and every scale you can always tell
them like look there is there is a whole
git work we put
on on that technology so yeah
does it answer the question i would
probably just add one thing is that it
can potentially the docker endorsement
and the product itself can potentially
also bring other large i.t partners into
the network or subject to feasibility
obviously
so that's probably um another another
one kind of elaborating on what you said
yeah so
yeah
i don't understand continuation
uh yeah i don't understand the idea that
uh gosh can be sort of a promo tool uh
to
tell the developers worldwide about
every scale which technologies it's used
and okay this one is accepted and i see
some great potential here um maybe even
people who are not aware of blockchain
or not working with the blockchain will
be still aware of at some point about
every scale which is perfect because
that community is huge and that's that's
just great things uh yet another
question that i have uh you told us that
the validators which
are running gosh uh have some pretty
expensive uh hardware to run the network
uh and so who's paying for that pancakes
we do
we do who else
uh so uh
at this point
it's like open investment from ever x
to uh
validate
um
currently the network but i might
presume that at some point some
tokenomics should be there uh and uh
what are your plans like you know
if at some point i would like to become
a validator and to earn some millions of
dollars yeah i just told you
you you will have a program
where you can lock your evers and get
some uh gosh talking to validate
yeah
but gosh doesn't generate income gosh
doesn't generate income so gosh talking
is not like you know backed by any
business model because it's free for the
developers
as a github is not totally free for a
developer github actually makes money
so obviously there is a there will be a
tokenomic and the business model for
gosh it's just it's just my point was
not that
uh oh we need to have everything for
free and no that doesn't work otherwise
it's not a business really right it
should be sustainable
um it's simply that the business model
of the blockchains today
if you compare that with the business
model of
uh of course corporations like github
google and amazon and so on it's very
very different
right because amazon for example and
github you can go and
you know start using it for free you can
not do that with any blockchain today
and any application of the blockchain
today with gosh we make it possible and
there will be a tokenomic that
um
we will release and you know you will
see
how
the special construction economic
construction allows us to do that but in
order to be able to build such a
construction
the tokenomics of the network should be
completely different from
um what it is uh what it is currently
with the blockchain
so
is that done yeah okay okay so
we are so we should be waiting for some
more detailed uh economics for gosh
blockchain it's yeah of course how this
could be profitable
for relevance and last but maybe not
least uh you said that at this point uh
the current version is sort of a test
version so don't bet your life on it uh
what are your plans uh you know i like
those questions to launch it as a
full-scale final product uh for
the two more
developers um
to be afraid of
we're aiming for three months process
our aim is three months again don't
just take my words and say okay he said
three months no i said our aim is three
months so we internally think that it is
possible within three months
uh if nothing wrong happens so it's
september
something something something close to
september september
you can use it again we use this three
months to collect feedback from
developers that starts to use it we
actually have a like a program
um a marketing program which um which
involves
some questionnaires
and some interviews that we're
conducting with developers
um and then developers use it and we
conduct an interview with them again and
so on and so forth so there is a process
of feedback loop which we are creating
now between the developers what they
want to see from you know kit on chain
because obviously it has a different
functionality apart from the basic
functionality of git
because it's on chain
in terms of security both security we're
also running
um there will be announcement of the
other partnerships that we're making
um
in particularly in the area where we
want to target the such as the big
corporations with the securities of
their supply chain uh secure software
supply chain and uh there will be
announcements about this inroads that
we're making now
um
to to do that to go and to
you know provide the solution for these
corporations in the particular area of
uh secure software these announcements
apart from announcements that we already
did on the dockercon with the partners
that we announced
um there will be also others and some
other technological partnerships where
the product will be like made in
cooperation with other
um
partners which which facilitates this uh
sssp ssc sorry process
okay thank you sounds very promising and
uh again the last one
do i understand correctly or correct me
if i'm wrong that gosh is sort of a play
test of some sort of a drive chain that
we'll be seeing on every scale
drive chain no the gauge does not have
drive chain right now the drive shift
development is in progress and it's in
parallel and the direction will be
introduced in both gaussian errors
memory scale actually every technology
we're doing is introduced everywhere
right so it's the same
thing maybe that's important also to
mention
that apart from the application itself
or smart contract development and and
some tricks like that
every
thing we do on the core level is shared
so basically it's just one code we don't
run any other
code in terms of
like the the basic the knowledge yeah i
just thought that gosh uh
i just thought that gauche stores uh the
data
on the blockchain and it's uh sort of it
does uh an implementation of the
direction
it does not it does store on the on the
the the large blobs um
are stored on actually in ipfs right now
they will be moved to drivetrain when
it's ready but right now the large blobs
of like binary files are stored in ideas
and they in the uh
so okay so
this isn't
so so the the the draft chain is uh i
think yet to be implemented both on
gaussian for both yes exactly we would
not we would not implement something on
the gosh and would not implement it on
ever scale that doesn't because we don't
have resources actually to support two
parallel developments uh like that so
it's just one core team that develops
one core functionality for for the same
like network for the same core
so drivetrain will be introduced to
every network
okay that's all thank you michael for
all your questions those are some really
great questions i saw that it also
covered some of the
ones popping up in youtube i have a
concern from the
uh from the community is what happens if
gosh takes off what will everex's
priority be
um if it's a separate chain
would every scale be sidelined
as i said
the the development of the core the core
technology is the same so in what
respect it would be sidelined
um
i think they feel that
the team's uh focus will move to gosh
it's it's a feeling that
it doesn't matter where
focus on gauche is the same focus as the
noir scale there's simply exactly the
same technology
exactly the same code
uh and if we introduce something for
gosh it means we introduce it forever
scale and if we introduce something for
gosh or on everscale it means
that you can use it to develop such
application as gosh neverscale meaning
um i don't know it's for example
there will be i don't know drivetrain
for example drivetrain is great for nfcs
and great for many things that that
needed in both this and that so i mean
what kind of thing we could develop in
gosh is a focus on gosh what kind of
thing would development gaussian would
not take any
um unless it needs or
use in every step i don't i don't know
any of that i don't know any any such
technologies
okay i just don't see that as a
like
that's the thing or would we just uh let
every scale fall uh if something stops i
don't know i i think yeah i think some
people are concerned you have to
remember we have a lot of tokens we have
a lot of tokens on our scale right so
i
mean so you're not abandoning abandoning
billions of tokens
exactly billions do we have billions of
tokens
throwing it out there
with everything combined i see
okay uh we have a question about
liquidity pools that were quickly
mentioned um when it was
announced
tell us about the additional liquidity
pools on everscale with gosh tokens that
was mentioned and we'll all take these
staking calls yeah yeah
well that that will be as i said the
third time
you will be able to lock your everest
in the pools
to get to start the validator
in the gosh network and to get the
rewards in gosh
the rewards i can just give you
a
snippet from the economics
the gosh rewards rewards on gosh network
are not from transaction fees and they
are not from block creation fees so
because that's infeasible for such a
network
you just get rewards for
making committing the validator resource
you just make a
have a reward
in terms of the stake reward like a
financial reward
like you do in farming basically you
lock you validate and by that you get
rewards in tokens
that's it
it's not paid for blocks it's not paid
for
for um
for transactions it's paid for the time
you lock your tokens
in if you don't lock your tokens you can
be validated but you won't get any
reward zero reward
what's that alex
sorry i was just practicing with this
new zoom tool the uh joint work but i
don't think we would need that so well
i'll remove it in a second
okay
can we
how can we use the white white board
yeah is it a whiteboard yeah it's a
whiteboard very cool actually so
i cannot see nor do anything with this
is it
oh i can't do anything how did you do
that it's only you can do that
it's uh no everybody can choose it no
abs i'm afraid to click things i might
screw something up look sorry for
distraction
just so they do something different
around here
um
back to
back to the tokens um uh i have another
question does it even make economic
sense to validate gosh
if you like gosh if you think gosh
tokens are would be worth something then
you can make this tokens by locking
everest and getting these rewards and
depends on the lock
uh time you will get more of the course
tokens if you believe in gosh tokens
after reading the tokenomics you might
decide that it's interesting if not
since
makes sense okay that was it for what
had been in the community before and
michael and michael actually covered
most of them so i deleted them
and so we're not now on youtube and i
have a request to sing and well no
and we just swim with dolphins
okay gnome asks i'm not going to sing
gnome asks what do you mean by closed
network why is it closed and alex you're
still screen sharing it's a private
network right now it's basically we're
running validators all of them
that's it
okay and we're not giving any tokens to
anyone
no drops
no
nothing another okay
how and where customers code will be
stored
you can start right now just just don't
bet on it to be there in
that next day um as i said we hope to
get into production statement within
three months
where you can really
like
put your code in there and of course
that also requires
some decentralization
and that
where
staking comes into play
if you would like to participate you can
contribute to that decentralization part
that leads
you kind of covered the next question
and leads right into it can you please
explain in a couple words why github is
not decentralized enough
so we need god it's not decentralized at
all
what's what to explain it's a run by
microsoft
the mother of decentralization
um
how it is decentralized that was sarcasm
everyone by the way i think so
the question was sarcastic i think right
how github was not decentralized enough
that sarcastic question for me no it
didn't didn't tone didn't seem sarcastic
example oh really people missing the
point that that github is is run by
microsoft and it's completely
centralized and although all of your
code belongs to microsoft and you cannot
do anything without that it's stored on
there it starts it starts and they're on
their servers and if they want to hack
your code or
just stop your access to this code they
can do it and they like that
is that enough decentralized for you
i think you just sold it you just saw
gosh
that's all i had to say exactly
i can say more like for example they get
let's go one level deep like below and
you go to level of your depository as
you know the repositories in github has
or gitlab for that matter as the owner
and the owner can do whatever
they like
whatever they like
take access from you to the repository
you contributed for dozens of years
tomorrow like that
and here you go you don't you're not
contributor anymore how about that
decentralization
right they can delete your code
sorry you didn't exist
your work of your lifetime of this
repository
does not count
you're free to go
how about that
for this introduction so powerful that's
powerful
huh
that sounds nice
i know it's powerful stuff i know i know
it's powerful stuff
get get today
is the most centralized
uh like
thing in the world
github gitlab doesn't matter
even your if you even if you run the git
in your organization okay you can you
can put the server in git laptop doesn't
load that you take gitlab you can you
can run it in your own uh like
does it make it decentralized no
because then if you run your own server
you're not confederated
right you're not part of the community
anymore the community feature all simply
disappears from you
right and still it runs by the admin of
this web server this server as the
server goes or you know it's in data
center someone takes it done go on
same thing
this is not solved
and remember
you are if you are a blockchain
developer i'm not talking about okay
let's forget about this corporate guys
for a second well they have the same
problem
uh but um let's let's say you are um
you're just a you know blockchain
developer and you you create a
decentralized application you run the
decentralized application you put it on
github
it's absurd
it's it's absurd we have bitcoin code on
github
come
on
if tomorrow someone would like to
close bitcoin
they can only do one thing very simple
just some malicious code in the
repository you don't need to you don't
need a 51 attack
you don't need any of that
you just uh you just basically put in
and in the in the in the github some
some malicious called and uh from the
back door in the server itself
nobody will ever even understand it's
there
and who knows how many of this malicious
code is already there
can can i follow up on that medium
because i know that you've been kind of
talking and thinking and um doing some
steps on the grassroot marketing
so were there any practical thoughts or
steps in the core bitcoin community on
this because this can be bomb you know
in a good sense of the sport bitcoin
community
did look into that and for looking into
that for years already uh the the core
developers of bitcoin are looking into
decentralized gift they the only thing
that they kind of came up the coal
industry came about this was radical
project which is great project has
nothing to do with blockchain
and uh it's therefore it's not
decentralized enough you mean you cannot
there is no guarantee that it suggests
realized basically it's it's just just
statements
it's a nice project but it's but until
you put it on the blockchain basically
the blockchain limitations
is that up until now without ever scale
you just couldn't do that
and uh and the only way to do that
decentralized is to put it on the
blockchain here you go you couldn't do
that the only way to do that is to do
that now if you are a blockchain
developer it doesn't matter if you're a
bitcoin developer
ethereum core developer you want to put
your code on gosh
once it's in production and once it's
sufficiently decentralized absolutely
because because that's what we need to
do
you cannot avoid it really
right
you like it or not
cool
very good answer uh so michael where is
the code stored now does it use ipfs
the code is in the blockchain the code
is on the blockchain only the large
blobs which has
binary files like this you know because
that's probably the large code
you have it's probably binaries
that part stored on ipfs will be stored
on worksheet once it's available
so everything we will move everything on
chain right now part of the big
basically not
not
crucial critical because usually
uh when it's over the size limit of the
blob it means
that
it means that it's binary think even if
you just put a binary inside the
bar script like we discussed today that
you know people are putting whole
binary files inside the bar script
uh apart from taking probably cutting
their heads or
hands hands whatever cutting something
off them for doing that yeah what the
story with an ipfs
okay
thank you uh we have a question from
elia what are the plans to solve the
problem of a very slow user interface
and why does everything work on a fast
scalable blockchain like on ethereum
it's it's the first version um
so yeah
[Music]
there are some
things that are not done yet once we're
done
it um
you know it it will be
of course it will be slower
than
uh just put that in the central server
simply yeah because we put it in several
servers so it's kind of slower
but it in the end it won't be
significantly slower so it won't affect
your work uh like
completely of course when you
upload like
will upload like linux kind of
repository then
you know it it may take some time to do
that if you upload it hold it with all
the 80
million
uh
you know objects that they have there so
it will take some time but uh yeah and
um
apart from that
it is obvious that all the
kind of
um
improvements that were made to the core
network right now on everscale uh for
improving latency and improving finality
and all of this stuff
very well
needed and applied to gosh as well so
to the question
you know if we develop the same thing
yeah we need we need all of us need the
same things basically
so we're working on that as well
but right now it's just not optimized
enough so there's a lot of optimizations
coming within this three months to make
it faster
okay great
uh next question is it recommended to
run gosh on a layer two and then
finalize on chain on a timed basis no
yeah we're we're against l2 solutions as
you know and i i went lengthy into that
in the white paper i don't want to
repeat that
l2 sucks
big time
okay
and the next question is are there any
plans to integrate gosh economics into
everscale or technology promotion and
stacking of evers
that all about synergy between gosh and
everscale
there is a plan to
not a plan but i would say there is a
possibility
once there the whole stack is ready for
this we can
we can think about adding gauche as a
as a work chain to turbo scale but right
now
it's it's not possible technology
technically
currently because you because you will
need to
have
a work chain that um
the the pay gas in its own
currency so and so it's it's not ready
yet once it's ready once we can do
something like that we can think about
bringing gosh
into every scale as a work chain but
it's required anyway it will require the
same set of validators so more or less
the same thing right
so does it really matter if you look to
validate you will still lock the evers
it's almost the same okay
okay next question if everyone can use
gosh for free what's the business model
will there be a special feature for uh
paying repos yes there will be there
will be
paid features very simply
but the stock economics allow us to do
the tiered approach so we can have a
tier which is free
and then we can start introducing some
some paid
options like they have in github and
github today or aws so
okay um will drive chain follow the same
logic of separate business separate
blockchain with its own coin and
incentives
um
no the drive chain is is the whole point
of dry chain drive chain is being a work
chain so it will be drive chain work
chain or never scale that would drive
chain work chain on gosh
and they both have
uh their business model and then i'm
sure there will be different business
models on every scale it will follow the
some
you know economics of the of the of the
um
of the drive chain
whatever it will be and on gosh it will
follow this
again tiered approach because
same thing you need to
it doesn't matter what the object sizes
that you store in the
open source repository it should be free
right
so there will be different business
models they're just it's just not
compatible
but but each of them will have its own
business model of course
okay
uh would it be possible to run regular
smart contracts for free on gosh or can
you only use shell for specific
contracts no
no you can use shell for any contract
but you won't be able to run them for
free
so okay the free use is only for gosh
repositories
if you want to build your smart contract
on gosh apart from this repositories
then you need to pay for it
which is logical i think
okay um kind of struggling with the next
question uh
we make rename from
get on chain source hodler into get open
source toddler this means that they will
be no on-chain
coddler is already on chain
if you know what hoddle means it can
only be on chain so we kind of didn't we
thought that this will reflect this will
this reflects more
all of the kind of messages that we want
to convey
the geared the open source and the
huddling meaning that blockchain
tokenomics and decentralization yeah get
on chain would be a little redundant yes
exactly
okay
um any plans to provide open source
developers to integrate the product
value into some token and move its
circulation to everscale
it is possible
again there will be atomic swaps
uh built in so you can move freely
tokens between these networks
and
without the need for any breach any
whatsoever so you don't need you will
not need to have
separate validators on the bridge or
anything like that it will just move
freely between the networks which is the
great
like think when you have
two networks for the same design
now you can do that actually because you
can prove things on one network to
another with the same kind of
you know
same messaging basically
and
yeah i mean you can do you can build
whatever you want between the networks
sure
of course
everything is open
may i uh just interject for a second i
know there are some questions being
asked
on youtube in another language
unfortunately this is going to be in
english only so
uh they're going to be you can translate
them if you want if they're do do we
want to do that i think i only see one
yeah
yeah did you skip over that i'm sorry i
wasn't following no no i i was still up
i was still up okay when you get to it
then i i don't think it's a question
though i think it's a comment because
he's
doing that
he's doing what
that looked like a sequel
i don't know no no no no no no no
no no i was just sorry sorry bad joke
yes it was
ah okay um
yeah there's just some chit chat okay
if atomic swaps require kind of bridge
between gosh and everscale or since both
networks are built on the same
technology
i think i just
such swaps can be done more naturally
without any bridge okay groovy just
answer that perfect question they call
it
that's it for for youtube um
i was trying to keep an eye on the
community it was moving to too quick
with something to chat but i think
rowley is taking the lead there and he's
well no there was one question there
there was a question on youtube oh
another one yeah yeah if you scroll up
uh it says you can you cannot yeah yeah
let me let me let me try so there's a
uh
[Music]
oh
by mac rt is that the one yes yes so i
mean he's basically asking if there's a
way to
explain the principles
of uh the realization of tokenomics in
russian i think that probably that would
have to happen
uh in a separate session announcement or
that
could we please i mean yeah we can yeah
okay we'll do yeah we'll do
schedule and i'm a session in russian
and i will be happy to answer your
questions there it is
okay
foreign french
for that matter
[Music]
or in hebrew whatever
any language
swahili
yeah i think that's about it for the
questions nothing else is popping up
unless anybody on the call had excellent
anything yeah i thought it was going to
be like two hours
yeah i was betting three
like pitchforks and things i that's what
that's why i said let's cover it in a
week so people are come down and
realize many questions they don't need
to ask
[Music]
and it's just yeah but you you covered
it
all why didn't we have all this
information on the day somebody's saying
you missed because we were too busy to
to busy with the launch i mean it just
was i mean you have to realize
uh that
like people
literally
didn't sleep for three weeks
like
i i we had people crashing inside
meetings
like
crushing falling asleep within a meeting
so no it would didn't it couldn't be
done
we have two more questions
i think it got skipped
uh
how would the docker verification
extension work i mean how how to compile
the code you need a compiler but
how do you get verified compiled
compiler
uh
okay it doesn't it doesn't work like
that so
it's it's um
uh you build um
you don't need to verify the compiler
it's more or less what we do with the
formal verification so you
uh you build
the
you build in the docker build
um you build the the container you build
the image
then you create an artifact and put the
image metadata on chain
and then
you launch that in the docker desktop
you take the metadata from the chain and
you rebuild the container from within
the desktop
and
it it verifies that the hash all the
hashes are the same
so
[Music]
that's how it works in just very brief
details i don't want to go deeper there
are some considerations
and the hashes of the container is not
that simple as you might think actually
we like
if you know what docker
crash container is
you may know that they are always
different
so we had to actually build the hashes
ourselves and stuff like that was it was
quite an undertaking
uh it's not as easy as it sounds but in
the end yeah that's what you you you
kind of verify
within the extension that
that the container is the same
containers you built and that would
build from gosh and you also verify it
and try against you know you could take
again all the gauche files are available
to you
and you can verify that they are part of
the blockchain as you know because we
have the proof in the sdk so you have
this proofs
and now you have the
um
rebuilding this from the core source and
compared to the hash of the container
that you run in
you run the desktop in
that's
basically okay
of course we rely on some basic
containers so
like
of course the basic container
you can still build it from within then
you trust it and so on and then the
chain of trust is built between the
containers they will it's it's a it's a
very interesting topic a very
interesting subject and that's actually
what your software supply chain is
and we will expand we'll bring more
tools
into this part
um and for that we work with great
partners uh
to do that i but i cannot
still i cannot
talk about them yet
okay
how we're going to like tile the knots
there in in in this process of
you know of this building this chain of
trust
picking up these components
okay
but as i said before we sorry as i said
before we will also
want to move to ci cd part and we want
to
replace jenkins
big portions of jenkins as well because
this is jenkins is a huge security
call
one big security hole actually
and we want to put this whole process on
chain as well and include that
so
you not only build containers and you on
top of these containers you will hold
your continuous delivery process
on top of that containers and this also
kind of goes back and forth between the
blockchain and the and the uh your test
test runs and so on and so forth
um
yeah it's a
[Music]
it's interesting
okay
no more
how can i how can i run
like tests in one programming language
on the on the blockchain which is like
separate
uh environment
this has nothing to do with programming
languages
how you build container today we don't
care about
what what programming language did you
use right
you're asking about what languages of
what of cicd or what languages
i i'm just asking uh where where the
actual cicd process go it will it will
be one chain basically so the scripts
will be the smart contracts
and
the and
the binary
and you run it like on off chain
locally and execute all your cicd
process using this
uh but you can always verify that what
you run locally is the same as as you
run it on the blockchain
it's like debug model
okay ci cd debug
okay
so moving on i think we only have a
couple left i'm not sure if this one's a
joke though because you might have
answered this a few times already sorry
about that but it got pointed out again
um
yeah is it possible that gosh will have
its own defy in economics other than get
on chain and i ask if it might bypass
everscale economics in that regard
not sure about what you mean by
bypassing
bypass
bypasses and
take us
i
don't know about values it's a
speculation
but
you can
you know you can benefit from both
so what do you care who bypasses whom
uh it's really not important it's
important is that you provide value you
build value and then you benefit from it
and if you benefit
if sitting on everscale would benefit
from gosh vice versa why not
i mean
it wouldn't have defy applications
not in the sense
that you might think of meaning that
when you say defy
like gouache is everything
surrounding git and open source
so um
it will provide ways to monetize your
open source repositories
but it's not the defy that you used to
have
in every scale for example where you
know you have pairs trading and provide
liquidity farming and stuff like that
that you have basically it's a
speculative activities gosh is not about
speculative activities mostly it's about
real value and real applications
so in that respect it's
well i don't know what you consider defy
and because the i today it seems it's
just inflation
[Music]
of some assets moving from one asset to
another
it doesn't trade on top of
um
real value creating applications
and that's a big problem that defy
actually
it only works because
it is still too little of that
right
if you if if you have a financial
instrument
on nasdaq for example
and this financial instrument is like
options
for example trading on top of the
i don't know google stock
google provides value sells something
products
and and then you can speculate on top of
that
on this base of these assets if you want
to take that and make it decentralized
right and provide the decentralization
tools for this just realized finance on
top of that financial tools
then then you can say that you have
decentralized the financial tools
if you just take the tools without the
asset underlying yet
then it's a speculative right because
you don't have any
intrinsic value
right there is a value in the in the of
course there is a value in the financial
tools there is some financial tools that
has interesting value for them if you
provide the ability to something it must
have been
you know
worth something
financial
the question is what is the underlying
security and if the underlying security
does nothing except for
coming back to this to the financial
tools again
then this is some limit to
where this financial tools can go
right they need to be fed with some real
assets
real like by real i don't mean
real estate i mean
real value to the user right so user
will use it and so on and so forth
sooner or later that must
have happened
and gouache is all all about value
because they
there is enormous value locked in the
open source projects they provide real
value for real people for for real
applications you use this tools
um every day
this open source tools and this open
source tools so they are valuable to you
they're available to many people and
they're not monetized today
unlocking this value or mostly not
monetized like the open source business
model does not happen actually
you think about that it's a very i
thought about that for years
like
the monetization the business model of
open source is a big problem it's not
solved
and i think the only way to solve it is
for blockchain so gosh is trying to
solve that but that's a long-term goal
and and it's definitely not defined the
sense that you think of it as it is
right today so
yes and no
okay that was a fantastic answer
i'm going really in depth there um
moving on the source code shows the use
of ipfs but i have not yet fully
understood exactly how it will be used
what is the role
just already if you have a large blob uh
which which which
by certain threshold this block will be
stored
the blob will contain the hash and the
address and the ipfs and they and then
uh object itself will be stored on ibiza
you mentioned this and it's it works
right
yeah
um
the web interface is not part of the
public component what is the reason for
this it will be no reason
okay you will be
um
will the gosh interface be adapted to
uh use the usual non-crypto communities
to be intuitive for use by the average
person it is
it is exactly like github today yeah
so
the only reason the only difference
right now there are two difference right
now one you need to
just
just remember the 12 words
so that's kind of a thing but we will
get away from that
we have a
interesting ways to get away from that
um
but in the end you you will have like
for example use some some
other application to store this still
like so that's doesn't go away because
the decentralization comes with you
remembering 12 or 24 words
um
that's one thing the second thing is dao
dao is what different from but there's a
whole point right so you the
decentralization tools to manage your
repository decentralized decentralized
way
is the dow way right how to manage your
repository in a dual way and
it's only start right now they basically
just distribute
it launch the dow
you deploy the dow distribute 100 tokens
to each participant
that you invite to
you know to the organization and and
then you you vote for this hundred
tokens
but of course it's just the beginning
there is by the way the smv smart
contract
and
i completely forgot
to mention
some reason
from the teams that i i said three teams
okay it's four teams of course i don't
know why
slept uh provendo um of course is one of
the four teams uh provenda did the
the smb
uh part so this will be voting is uh all
written contracts are written by
provendo and um
yeah so so so then you're deploying this
dao and of course there are many uh
things on top of this dial that will be
uh the next two three months will be
added
um that will and we're collecting actual
feedback right now about what are the
tools that we need to add there to add
there are some interesting questions
actually very interesting questions not
going to go there but there are very
interesting questions about
how to
there are some corner cases in this dao
case how you manage repositories within
the dao
that are not easy to solve but yeah but
that's very interesting
okay great
thank you we have an idea for you um
what do you think about this a good
model for gosh would be stakesome ever
to get some gas per day like a
subscription model if you run out of gas
you just stake more evers what do you
think about this
i i don't think they
does
like us
you you can stake covers validate get
rewards that's it
why do you need gas i mean you don't
need guns you can use it for free
why do you need this okay
just an idea um
let's see
okay if you believe in open source then
explain what is your position or policy
on working with external participants
pull requests are not being considered
at this time
it's an it's a it's a sarcasm and irony
at the same time
well maybe
pull requests are not considered
because we
just simply don't have resources
do you think about that maybe that's the
reason why
okay or we just bad people you know i
think i will go with the second one
we don't we don't answer pull requests
you write them we encourage you to write
them
to make the pull request
i will promise you we'll never answer
just like that because we mean
we're bad people
that's satisfactory though
great answer thanks i know yeah but
tried
okay we have a question from alex
mitchell can you please elaborate on how
many teams developers are now giving
feedback on the product
how many is it in ballpark
um
it's more it's more than 50
right now and we're expanding it we also
we kind of have limited resources so we
cannot just take on
5 000 developers but if you have
feedback and if you want to join just
you know team me i will send you to the
right people
basically they
that's the kind of mailing list
okay
we have a good question here do you need
beta testers or is it too early yeah you
can yeah we do need yes absolutely
there's a give a feedback that's the
whole point
what's the best place there's a gosh
telegram group is there anywhere else
somebody can join and
telegram groups is the only way to give
feedback okay
thank you we it's up purposely so
because we cannot run again
to
100 places
please give feedback there there will be
also if you if you i forgot i mean you
can subscribe right go to gosh
and subscribe
and this subscription will get you into
the list the mailing list and you will
receive the questionnaires
where you can contribute to the
development directly and these
questioners are taking taken very
seriously because that's what we are
doing it's been collecting feedback now
okay great i saw that you put um the
social tags uh on the bottom too the new
edition so you can join the telegram
group just from the website no the
telegram yeah of course the telegram
group is there
but the join mailing list you will get
into particularly the beta program okay
okay interesting
um
the tonics project solves part of the
needs of the gosh architecture so is it
not clear why the tonic's components are
not used in the development of gosh
which components
tongues products yeah um
[Music]
listen
the
it's
you you see
[Music]
to to do this effectively where people
are saying like it's too slow right now
right
and uh if it would use linux components
it will be it would be even slower
for
except because it it's it's um
it's not a use case okay and this use
case
will be used
but not on the basic level basic level
you just want you know push
and you want this push to be fast
really fast
and in order to do that you need to
really optimize the architect by the way
it's not optimized as i said
really optimize architecture to allow
this
to work really just you know
okay flex is a great example if you if
you use flex if you ever used flex
by the way drawing the beta program and
you will
you can see how fast it is
and um if we would just
use the
kind of
just make a architecture that would be
you know
kind of put the
you know how how
corporate architects software architects
usually do that right put a lot of this
boxes on the board and okay this will go
there and this will go there if we do
that
i mean flex would be very slow like we
have a lot of slow applications on every
scale right now because simply because
people don't think how to reduce the
you know the messaging load and stuff
like that
and we think about every message
like
every single message the whole
architecture just just and we actually
right now it's not so but
we already know how to optimize it to
even like more parallelization
less messages and so on so
every contract has every message there
is counted so it's not just do they take
components from there it works you know
subsystem boom boom
it doesn't work like that
you can do that in in when you need it
in a particular application but
again it should be optimized for
something you cannot do everything for
everybody at least not yet i mean
whenever scale will have a subsequent
finality on the blogs maybe you know
but still if you think about 80 million
objects in the repository you
just got answers
okay
excuse my dog barking
um
i believe this might be the last
question um for the gosh telegram group
is there a chat group or is it just a
news channel
it's a news channel where you can chat
okay when you can only comment on
yes you can on the on the posts and the
posts are there for this particular
purpose okay for you to comment on that
there are different languages so the
english there is
all other languages
please provide the feedback and
we collect that feedback okay
okay
i don't see anything
else
um
nobody else on the call nothing in the
community i think
we covered everything excellent thank
you thank you very very much yeah that
was great i think you
covered everything that people were
wondering about and now we can finally
all get excited about gosh
great
great guys
yeah see you soon
thank you have a nice night yeah bye
everybody
you
