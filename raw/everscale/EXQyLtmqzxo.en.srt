419
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,670
fascinating thing happened there's a
there's a guy by the name of joseph lowe

420
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
there's a guy by the name of joseph lowe
 

421
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,269
there's a guy by the name of joseph lowe
he's the chairman of the uh of the

he's the chairman of the uh of the
 

423
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,670
he's the chairman of the uh of the
credit union and he he looked at the

424
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:47,680
credit union and he he looked at the
 

425
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,590
credit union and he he looked at the
correct the credit union legislation and

426
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
correct the credit union legislation and
 

427
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,870
correct the credit union legislation and
he said you know

428
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
he said you know
 

429
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,070
he said you know
it looks like they're talking about a

430
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
it looks like they're talking about a
 

431
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,190
it looks like they're talking about a
blockchain

432
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
blockchain
 

433
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,949
blockchain
because if you look at a credit union

434
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
because if you look at a credit union
 

435
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,710
because if you look at a credit union
and you look at a blockchain a credit

436
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
and you look at a blockchain a credit
 

437
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,509
and you look at a blockchain a credit
union is um it's a nonprofit so it's not

438

union is um it's a nonprofit so it's not
 

439
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,990

00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
centrally controlled right it is uh it
 

441
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,670
centrally controlled right it is uh it
has a field of membership which means

442
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:03,680
has a field of membership which means
 

443
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,150
has a field of membership which means
it's permission communication

444
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
it's permission communication
 

445
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,070
it's permission communication
of course exactly

446
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
of course exactly
 

447
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,750
of course exactly
you have to make decisions based on

you have to make decisions based on
um a survey of its members we call it

450
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
um a survey of its members we call it
 

451
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,430

489
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,509
that i've been aware of up until now but
of course i mean the decentralization

490
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
of course i mean the decentralization
 

491
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,949

didn't start with blockchain did it

492
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
didn't start with blockchain did it

credit unions are

494
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
credit unions are
 

495
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,230
credit unions are
an evolution of stuff

496
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
an evolution of stuff
 

497
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,509
an evolution of stuff
and so

498
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
and so
 

499
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,590
and so
well let me just share this a little bit

500
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
well let me just share this a little bit
 

501
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,470
well let me just share this a little bit
so

502
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
so
 

503
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,630
so
so this is potentially the very first

504
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
so this is potentially the very first
 

505
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,430
so this is potentially the very first

508
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
organization right
 

509
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,590
organization right
in the banking financial services system

in the banking financial services system
 

511
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,750
in the banking financial services system
so what what's amazing about that is

512
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
so what what's amazing about that is
 

513
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,350
so what what's amazing about that is
they realize that if they organize

514
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
they realize that if they organize
 

515
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,190
they realize that if they organize
around a credit union

516
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200
around a credit union
 

517
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,790
around a credit union

520
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
the sec
 

521
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,550
the sec
so all of the all of the barriers

522
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
so all of the all of the barriers
 

523
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,790
so all of the all of the barriers
pushing back on these projects right

524
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
pushing back on these projects right
 

525
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,110
pushing back on these projects right
essentially don't apply in the credit

526
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
essentially don't apply in the credit
 

527
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,110
essentially don't apply in the credit
union so they came to us and they asked

528
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120
union so they came to us and they asked
 

529
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,269
union so they came to us and they asked
us if we could work with them and or

530
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
us if we could work with them and or
 

531
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,190

and then they're trying to build out a

534
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
and then they're trying to build out a
 

535
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,430
and then they're trying to build out a
banking court

banking court
 

537
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,670
banking court
and uh i told him it's got to be a gba

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
and uh i told him it's got to be a gba
 

539
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,550
and uh i told him it's got to be a gba
member

540
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
member
 

541
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,790
member
so uh uh they were talking to non-gda

542
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
so uh uh they were talking to non-gda
 

543
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,990
so uh uh they were talking to non-gda
members i said that's not really good

544
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
members i said that's not really good
 

545
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,910
members i said that's not really good
for me so

for me so
 

547
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,389
for me so
they went to everscale and ever scale

right so you know we are looking at the

642
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
right so you know we are looking at the
 

643
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,030
right so you know we are looking at the
environmental stuff that that's

644
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
environmental stuff that that's
 

645
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,470
environmental stuff that that's
important but we're also talking about

646
