um nice to see you all thank you for all
organizers um of this beautiful
conference uh we're gonna speak
on my i think favorite topic uh it's
daos and how we're gonna manage
organizations and blockchain in the
future and first so to introduce myself
i'm an initial member of everscale and
defy aliens we have beautiful speakers
today with us as well uh i'll
first introduce all of them and then let
them speak about their products and
projects so vasilis mikalav here is the
managing partner in everfund victor lee
is the court team member of club
ventures
uh hugo gabriel is a ceo of
ix dao
christina
i think you know
you know her all very well she's editor
chief editor-in-chief in coin telegraph
and uh
phong jack gun is it correct yes uh from
millennium adventures so guys before we
go to the first topic maybe you speak a
little about what you do and maybe it
has something to do with dao as well
yeah
hi i'm vasilis mikal
my background has been
investment banking and
now i'm focused on the uh ever fund
as
vlad spoke earlier today
that would be a dao
managed on chain fund
and i think it's uh
a great
project to
boost
the development of ever scale ecosystem
yeah thank you victor hey everyone uh my
name is victor uh i'm from singapore
i've been in the crypto space since
2016.
i
did a lot of crypto stuff with battery
personally i'm also advising and
incubating and investing uh via my own
dow fund we have a fund called dial
ventures we actually help to invest
incubate a lot of different dial
projects and rapidly projects that we
can add value
because of that hobie
global
is actually recruited me to actually
help them to advise and also lead them
on the adventures department so i work
very closely with hobby's core team on
listings on incubation and adventures
hello everyone my name is igor gavrilov
and i'm chief technological officer of
ix dao xda was the fastest growing
builder so you can create a dao for your
investment fund hedge fund on dawa
we
we are a project on evm compatible
blockchains and we already deployed our
project to 21 blockchain incredible
number of chains superstars from even
world ethereum polygon binance marching
avalanche phantom and this infinite list
and i'm a professional mathematician
right now i'm a cto i'm just a big gig
nerd at this company
manage all the technological processes
and right now we grow because that was a
trend and we want to engage you in our
world today thank you
i'm so astia stu
i'm cristina lucrezia
in chief at queen telegraph one of the
oldest and biggest publications
dedicated to blockchain and
cryptocurrencies we were founded in 2013
and since then our mission is to bring
education to the masses about the
potential of this wonderful technology
and also to bring diversity and
inclusion into the blockchain space
to diversify projects to diversify
presence of different communities
and that is why dao is a very
interesting topic because it's
definitely
one of the most promising trends now
that can bring together the community
that constitutes in my opinion the most
precious asset of the blockchain
ecosystem people and community thank you
hi good afternoon
testing good afternoon everyone
uh my name is fong jack gunn so i'm i'm
the founder for millennial ventures
and uh in 2015 started two uh metrofund
one is called jubilee capital
doing early stage vcs and
ghibli blockchain fund which uh started
to invest in
a lot of early stage
ico projects and layer one there two
projects and so one of the earlier uh
projects i've invested in building was
daostak
right and uh met up with
martin phil at the time and he was a
really a fantastic person who kind of
opened my eyes to how dao could be
really innovative and change the world
but of course no the world have changed
pretty much uh and
uh i saw the evolution of how dao have
changed from the early days of
kickstarter right
it's kind of like dao 1.0 and after jobs
uh act in us it was passed
then you you see the evolution that you
changed to evolve into this angel list
and you have the early stage of
crowdfunding which is equity
crowdfunding rewards crowdfunding that
crowdfunding and i see dao today as like
a 2.0 uh 3.0 right almost like a maybe
two 2.5 kind of a stage so very
interesting to have this opportunity to
have some chats with our non-prestigious
panelists thank you very much for
inviting me thank you thank you for the
introductions and let's move to our main
topic
so we been introduced to dao i
calculated only roughly six years ago we
first heard the concept
i don't know whether you remember but i
remember these days when i for the first
time i wrote
i read the first digital autonomous
organization but back then i think i had
it was something different so
over these six years dow evolved and the
first thing i would like to hear your
opinion what is dao for you
what's because
i i guess not all our listeners know
what is dao itself
let's try to describe for them uh the
concept yeah
cool so yeah okay so i think if you look
at it literally decentralized
autonomous organization so there
shouldn't be any centralized control
by right there shouldn't be any
centralized control but organization it
should be all
um
maybe determined by or governed by
a decentralized group of stakeholders
so but i feel that this is a more of a
idealistic
definition today for doubt to be
successful you probably need to have a
hybrid model on one hand it's a fully
hundred percent decentralized on the
other hand it's like it's overly
centralized which is what you don't want
to see
but for for a doll to to be effective i
think we need to have some form of a
hybrid model
yeah so
uh i see it as a
vehicle or it's instrument maybe a
design where you can engage large
numbers of stakeholders who are
interested in the course
of this dial
and the because of this dog could be for
various purposes it could be for
commercial reasons could be for social
reasons it could be for education
reasons whatever the reasons could be
but you use this as a platform to gather
the stakeholders interested party to
provide resources
uh into this course right to be people
money
uh no other connections or whatsoever
and so they can channel resources to
complete
uh a certain task or certain proposal
through a
voting mechanism it's governed by you
know the dial uh
governing policies
yeah
any any other opinions on the topic well
i would maybe just
like to add that for me dao is an
incarnation of
the importance of the role of community
within the blockchain sector
and i guess
this is the sector our sector is the
most
representative in terms of if in terms
of its communities it means that
communities
influence
investment decisions it's the first time
ever that community plays
uh equally important role along with the
core team with the project itself
and with the the roadmap
and dao is incarnation of this
corporate scheme while corporate is not
a good word business ecosystem scheme
where the community is put in the center
of all the
all the business processes
uh but i still would like to highlight
that we are
in the very early stage and
i'm pretty sure that even those who are
very interested in taos
do not yet know very well how exactly it
should work
but it doesn't mean that we shouldn't
delve into this
experiments on the country
but there will be challenges there will
be
mistakes
and only through this
we can achieve
[Music]
a better
world
with a better involvement of communities
suppose you have a friend and he is very
good at playing with digital assets what
is the way to delegate your money to him
in a cheap transparent trustless and
secure way there is a concept for it
this concept is a dao dao is an organic
concept how to collaborate in the fire
space
the same that you can do with
traditional organizations you can do in
the fire space using smart contracts
that now use for these purposes
so suppose that you take a look at the
unicorn startup at the big company
facebook apple google or maybe amazon
it's not a single member solution to
grow to this size
this is an organization with a lot of
members and
in this case you have to have a really
cool team to
improve your company when you have a
transparent way to collaborate with your
team members
you will grow faster and in this case
people tend to spend more money when
they see a safe solution and they see
how the money goes and in this case thou
is a transparent system of
collaborations for me
that's it
thank you thank you
um i think for my point of view i think
that uh we have to first clarify a few
things with the audience first right
uh
there has been a lot of companies or
protocols used the word tao
and if you look at the public opinion a
lot of people interpret dao as a
re-bracing protocol they're always
thinking hey dao there are ponzi scheme
that is what has happened in the market
right we shouldn't be ignoring the fact
if you go to a lot of telegram chats a
lot of chats of people who actually
bought a lot of dow tokens
their interpretation of the word dao is
a ponzi and rebasing token i think we
have to separate that right i think now
for for the panelists here and the
original meaning of dao is actually
decentralization right so
you know if you look at it from from
that perspective i think the biggest
difference of between dao and the
traditional uh companies are
decentralization and democratization
so if you look at you know how companies
are being run
generally speaking in a web 2 space the
the shareholders or the board of
directors are the one in control of the
protocol right if you look at twitter if
you look at facebook if you look at
every of this protocol the one that
makes the money is just the directors
and the shareholders but in a dow
for the first time ever in the web 3
space
that community who are holding nfts and
tokens part of the dow could have a
voice could actually do something part
of the organization
and if you ask me that it's actually the
game changing component because
this is this is where the the
shareholders or the stakeholders for the
community or the organization because
it's purely decentralized they could be
anywhere not being uh under specific
jurisdiction that could be part of this
organization and if you ask me that is
the biggest difference between dao and
web 2. dao is actually an improvement
over the web 2 with democratization and
decentralization
yeah true
um well
uh can i agree more with
what you guys all said about the
projects
um it's indeed the transparency uh of
all the decisions that are made
uh it is uh the involvement of the
community
we are in very early days still
and uh
um
there are questions about legal
personality of now funds how you manage
off-chain uh resources with with dao
this is a big question i think where the
where we need to work with
local
governments and regulators to find the
proper way to establish dows
and
there are doubts that are purely on
chain
and
the
beauty of dao's for me is full
transparency no corruption
and
you
as you involve the community
even the smallest community members have
can have great bright ideas about the
development
around the common goal
uh and uh
which are usually not heard
uh in big corporations as you earlier
mentioned
yeah great so many different opinions
about this specific thing um i remember
back in
2016 when this new concept was
introduced i was very thrilled at first
and i was a huge fan of what was
happening in the market but
then
what happened and shocked a lot of
people was the infamous dao hack which
led to
a fork of ethereum network as we know it
and this put me away
at daoist like for years i thought it's
a terrible idea it's a terrible idea to
manage
organizations to manage liquidity and it
really for a long time pulled back the
market from this interesting topic but
then of course i changed my mind but i
have a question
do you think that
dao's as a platform for liquidity
management
is safe these days we see this hacks
happening every month or so
or should it
be purely used for uh managing
organization uh or is it okay to manage
liquidity as well how safe you think it
is these days
as a moderator i could ask
you as a professional fund manager what
do you think about the
potential threats of
using dao for liquidity management
well i think there is no perfect
solution first of all clearly there are
risks
and
what we need
for
dow to be
the go-to solution for liquidity
management i think are kind of standards
and
something which is really well audited
uh and
there are a lot of projects
already happening which are solving this
um
but we need to also think about kind of
the other way around uh remember the
icos and all the agent problems with
people disappearing with funds right you
don't have this risk and dowse
so and it's a question about where is
the bigger risk right
if
uh the kind of bad agent risk or the
hack risk or if it disappears at least
you know where it goes yeah
it's transparent yeah indeed
so i i think for the organizations of
the future
and the liquidity management on dao will
be the preferred choice
now we
see
billions of dollars managed by dao so
people
believe in in the smart contracts behind
us
yeah
you got do you know how
can you tell how much money is being
managed in on your
kind of platform
more than 300 million dollars in tbl
about this and we grew 3.5 000 times in
six months
right now so in one thousand dollars
any other opinions on the topic
well i would just like to mention that
security breaches are not only about
liquidity it's also about information
and privacy and this is something we
should think about
when talking about daos
i'm personally not acquainted with the
tools and strategies i imagine that they
are uh to like create ndas for example
within the dao community
and to manage the flow of information
but it's also very important topic for
sure
maybe even at some point more important
than liquidity itself
and let me know this when when you have
a financial management company for
example investment fund you don't have
to distribute voting power among every
member when we will take a look at
traditional venture fund it has
managers and investors and
investors generally don't have voting
rights in this case and when you have
financial dow you will have to choose
for example five managers and distribute
voting power between them and you will
have 100 investors with liquidity
provider tokens so we'll have a
certificate that they provided liquidity
to this fund but we don't have to have a
voting rights
when you have more than 1 000 vote
voters in your dow and your venture fund
your voting will be stagnated in this
case you will don't you will not have
very very fast voting system when we
talk about the fire project management
it's okay to have a lot of members
because you don't have to create fast
proposals with faster province you you
can just do it in a long time that's it
yeah let's move to my next question you
just mentioned voting and i know whether
our guests know that recently everscale
network moved from initial governance
initial member governance to voting
governments
i think the website is called
everdao.net
so all uh
holders of ever tokens now can create
proposals can vote for other proposals
which was a huge step for us
but um
this is exactly what i wanted to ask uh
can you name good and bad examples when
this voting is efficient
because we also experience these
problems of overflooding of proposals
that people sometimes just miss some of
them how much time to give for voting
and bad examples as well when you think
it doesn't work it doesn't make sense
and dao just complicates the things
so let's maybe start from straight
forward that example when you take a
look at uni swap decks for example it
has 20 minutes deadline with a high
slippage and if you don't have uh fast
enough voting system uh the voting will
be declined because you you will not be
able to activate the transaction
because of high slippage if you are a
tax tax trading dow you have to have
fast voting systems if you
if you're a venture fund it's okay to
for you to have one week for a proposal
and if you are
if you're a defy project it's okay to
last your upgrades for three months
i think the um
hello testing yeah so i think for dow to
be efficient you can't be
like this my president can't be fully
100 decentralized where everyone
gets to vote or has to vote and it will
slow down the decision-making process
it's a bit like the upgraded version of
a cooperative right when you have a lot
of members or the social club
or even in some property management
funds that's being managed by a
dedicated team of officers who decides
on behalf of the members or the
stakeholders
so you can classify the different voting
rights according to maybe how material
or how important the various decisions
are
in the traditional way of constitutions
right when in a legal document you have
reserved matters
reserve methods are only decided when it
reaches a certain threshold in value
and you need certain approvals to be
obtained from the stakeholders you know
be you know different class of the
shareholders
and the voting rights approval rights
could be 51 percent or for 75 percent
whatsoever so the similar principles can
be incorporated through smart contract
in the dow
right so a lot depends on what is the
purpose of the dial in the first place
right if it's more for social
educational or some common good uh
courses that are not so material you can
yes you you don't need to have it's not
time sensitive and you can have the
benefit of
asking the whole community to kind of
participate and then give the vote but
if it's time sensitive then i think
that's it for investment position you
need this type within a certain period
of time it's better to have
the power of a
dedication of authority to be given to
uh
maybe a dedicated group of people to
design and that can be you know
incorporated into the
that is a token approval
system
so that's my easy job yeah thank you can
you make a microphone a little bit
louder for the phone
yeah thank you
any other opinions
victor
i mean there's no right wrong right so
i mean i think dao is just a name
we cannot expect dao to solve all our
problems right
somebody asked me hey is nft going to
solve all the ip and tef problem i mean
nft is just an ft you cannot solve
everything right so i think dow the same
thing right you cannot expect dao to
come and solve all the government
problems and regulatory problems and
governance problems i think it's just
more about movement and people get
together i think that that is the core
of it right uh i i think it's what many
changes now i mean all this movement has
been here for a long time but it's just
that because there's money in here then
suddenly you become a dow right
that's where the term dow comes from
then but i think dao exists on the
blockchain maybe i know maybe homework
there you know our government will exist
on a dao i don't know whether it could
happen that would create a lot of
removal a lot of uh you know issues in
our government yeah
yeah you know speaking of problems that
dao's tried to solve we discussed the
management we discussed the voting
but another particular interesting use
case is when dao is used to
distribute dividends
um
and
eventually it drives the prices of money
tokens up many times doing access on
returns x returns
what do you think is it like
a
way of market manipulation or is it a
good way of promoting the whatever token
is promoting network project etc can you
also maybe give some examples of good
dividend distribution and
not so good
i mean i think currently there's no i
mean there are some good examples of dao
but i did the best i i think they are
much more way too improved i mean using
example right maker dao has been doing
this for a long time right for uh die
stable coin for do to do so but are they
the best they are not right they still
have hacks they still have like you know
issues with their governance and they're
still trying to improve um i mean
there's no black and white in this but
of course there are some bad doubts
right that hey i just would use the word
the dao and raise money and then they
run away so i mean those are the bad
examples the good one is the one that
runs really transparently and has been
here for a while
i'm using the maker as an example right
although i'm not afraid with them but
you know the enemies has been well that
their name of the company and the dao
has been in the industry for a while
that you know that at least you can
trust their brand name right or their
association with that so i mean i think
you continue to improve um those are two
examples i can think of
actually i'd like to
hello
so i'd like to propose that actually the
dao can be used for more than just
commercial money making purposes right
because as a tool it's a neutral uh it
is neutral and can be used you can use
it for good you can use it for
not so good stuff
that's everything about using it for for
charitable organizations
right it's a way where you can
incentivize and motivate
stakeholders
towards a certain course
and the dollar token that's been issued
let's say the example of a charity
you want to motivate
volunteers
to contribute towards a certain good
cause and as and when these volunteers
get involved in contributing their time
that their talent their skills they get
rewarded
and the rewards that they receive can be
used
to exchange for some benefit either for
their own use in future as when they are
old or when they are no they need help
themselves they can get support from
some certain social communities or it
can be used to be exchanged for some
goods and services from a merchants who
are supporting um you know this is a
good cause
so the the dial itself can be directed
towards uh different course depending on
how we design it same thing for
investment down right we want to improve
the efficiency of you know decision
making in the traditional way when we
run the fund me i run the fund
for vcs and industries
for blockchain fund as well it takes a
long time to make a decision because you
have to go through all the paperwork and
all the discussions duty et cetera
uh but if the quantum if the company is
big then it makes sense if you are
investing in hundreds of millions
billions or not tens of millions it
makes sense to go through a due process
but if it's a small amount
then it's a waste of time right so you
may want to decentralize that and say
okay let the whoever that's interested
in a certain project you vote and if you
want to be in as long as there's a lead
you contribute we get the investment
done quick quickly so that uh depending
on value we can decentralize it so so i
think this is a true application at c
and for different industries you can
apply it for different purposes but
ultimately the dow is supposed to
influence behavior so what kind of
behavior do we want to drive and
certainly not scam and it's not
certainly not not trying to promote uh
pum and dumb
the rug pools no that's not the thing no
quick buck no we want we don't encourage
uh the investment community to come in
to try to earn a quick buck within short
term a short time period so you want to
build something that's long lasting
scalable meaningful value adding to the
society
so i think dao has a good attribute but
right now it's early days as you were
saying
we need to put in the right values and
write principles into it
thanks
when we talk about divisions profitable
financial companies are the use easiest
case here you just need to pin
this distribution proportion and you can
distribute all the profit to pin the
liquidity provider balances for example
in a single transaction and when we talk
about the five projects without a profit
system and you need to incentivize your
members
to
to reward them for voting and to rework
them for
better better solutions involved in your
voting process
this is a really big problem it's it's
not an easy easy easy way to just reward
stakeholders and other things and it
highly depends on the economics of the
project
and you need you need to
to do
deeper research in this case
dividends
are very easy when you we talk about
financial companies i actually agree
with what you were saying that um you
know about this issue
i'm not sure i mean everybody who are
following on twitter i saw that there's
a case of like 36 million dollars was
sent to another account that is
unretrievable that has happened
yesterday or the day before
from another company right start with
jay right
you know not afraid of them but when i
see that right it's really shady
it says that a bunch of voters decided
to vote and say that they're going to
remove the liquidity of one single guy
and then they take the money and then
they just send to somewhere else that
they cannot retrieve it seems like
there's not really how doubt does it but
a lot of people use that to manipulate
it so that it's actually where the bad
thing is happening
yeah so we were just discussing this and
i thought that dao is a really great
tool for user engagement and we all
remember
pioneers maker maker dao of course
i remember how urine finance became
popular when they introduced this down
mechanics and dividend distribution into
that protocol and that was later copied
by most of the d5 products like curve
etc
so but let's let's just try to imagine
what new dao mechanics could help
like
develop the blockchain products in new
spaces like
gamify nft
a good example i think personally
steppen is a good example of
implementing a dowel mechanic i called
for something new
in a new space move to earn right maybe
you have other ideas how can we use down
mechanics other interesting down
mechanics to
engage users into the blockchain
industry
i think everyone have a different
invitation on that right uh i give my
example on that i you know last year i
think a couple of months ago there was a
article published about flamingo dao
not associated with them but
they become a billion dollar now because
they invest into a lot of nfts last year
and within six months i think from like
a couple
tens of millions become a billion dollar
doll right again that is very exclusive
but it happens right so you know there's
a good example of that as well i mean
i'm not sure maybe everyone will have a
different reputation just for for
example i'll give you my example the the
things i like is fractional fractional
ownership of stuff this is what i'm
really excited about when when some
dao community buys
i don't know an expensive painting or
maybe in the future a yacht or a plane
whatever and just shares it but we
there are some examples but they're just
starting maybe you have other
interesting uh
like examples of implementing dao
yeah actually i think that example is
just a quite similar use case for
securitize uh no security token offering
right when we had ico then you have io
sto actually it's the same thing
unit trust is a form of
tokenization or you need a
fractionalization it's just we're
changing a different name
dao is just another form of it so subs
if we look at into the substance of it
we are just trying to divide the
ownership into different parts whether
you call it a unit or you call it a
shares you call it token you call it
what dial fraction
it's the same thing
so i think we we can look beyond
the actual use case and see how can we
use this as an instrument
a tool
to
change the way
people behave investors behave
or entrepreneurs behave right or the
community behave
and and then you know use it in the
manner where the value the transfer of
value become more efficient
because where web 3
adds a new advantage versus web 2 and b4
was that the transfer value
was very inefficient before
right to transfer a share holding from
one company one shareholder to another
you have to go through a lot of
paperwork
and the winner at the end of the day are
the lawyers the cop sack the accountants
there's no value right to the value
business but there's proper accounting
but today in the dow or in crypto
there's no proper accounting
there's no proper accounting of the gas
fees how much you're paying there's no p
l no balance sheet so how do you account
for it so if someone who can solve that
problem have proper accounting then i
think the operation of dao
can be a lot more efficient
and then the transfer value can flow
from
community users from one user to another
so today that's on facebook on instagram
all the contributors of content to all
these platforms they are not earning
anything
right so there's no there's no real
benefit to them but how do we
incentivize them in such ways as you
contribute you upload your video your
selfie your wifi whatsoever you get
rewarded and that reward can be
exchanged for something real they can
use so play too is a very good example
either x infinity your ygg or you know
when you use this slp to exchange for
goods i invested in avogado and
the guild is generating a lot of good
tokens
for the scholars right they can bring
food a table they can pay school fees
and the community is happy with it so
there's a positive social impact
to the society but if it's just for pure
commercial gain i think it's uh
it's a it's a bit it's a waste of the
the innovation so since there is a good
innovation and there's a lot of interest
into it
if there's a way to kind of uh tap into
this energy
use it for good uh for to generate good
positive progress you know the society
that this is aware i think of great
opportunity wherever skill can can play
a leading role in this
yeah we have a few minutes left let's
discuss the last topic i wanted to
discuss with you guys this is
the topic of
whether
what do you think can the dao solve the
problem of cross chain into
interoperability
uh
i would say that
i'll give you example uh not many people
know that the guys who built the bridge
every scale allows not just to vote
people but to cross chain execute the
vote into different chains and this is a
really interesting topic for me as well
and
do think that dao is a much bigger
concept than just you know voting and
managing liquidity that we can even
think of it as a tool
to execute different
whatever smart contracts on different
networks depending on let's say
uh
the voting or the proposals that are
pushed to the network or even depending
on some oracles in the blockchain
whatever
do you see
such applications
in the near future
can you think of them
can it help bring different blockchains
together
if you if you have a state transfer
protocol for example octus bridge you
just have to create a dao on a single
chain on a single chip chain for example
over scale maybe polygon for evm example
you distribute voting power on single
blockchain you distribute liquidity
provider tokens for investors one single
chain and now if you have a state
transfer protocol or any crocheting
solution you can manage your funds and
provide liquidity to any chain from the
dow side for example you can just
transfer your funds directly to a
startup open on finance marching or
furthermore you can provide liquidity to
rv on the ethereum if
your bridge provides this opportunity
and i deeply
inspired by this solution right now we
create a multi-chain platform and we are
looking for opportunities to
to scale our solution from multichain to
cross chain to allow the house to create
a single dow to manage all the funds of
course it's convenient because you don't
have to
duplicate your voting power tokens on
every blockchain you will have a single
centralized accounting in the central
space and that's it i think this is the
future and of course we need more
bridges because
nowadays bridges are not so cool to
provide all the experience we need fast
cheap and secure way to provide the
liquidity from chain to chain
yeah thank you gore i know you have a
lot of experience in this topic but guys
what do you think what coin telegraph
things i i i don't see
um
i mean down is like an application
so
if you look at it from a
web 2.0 or an internet view of if i
compare layer 1 to os operating system
operating system in the first wave of an
internet boom they were looking for
killer app
right so d5 was you can say that in in
the you know in the blockchain world
device one killer app gaming is one
killer app the question now is whether
or nfd is okay
it's dow a killer app
maybe not yet maybe the potential is
there but maybe not yet and bridging i
see bridging not as a
standalone uh problem that the dial can
solve but it's more like a feature or an
attribute that it has to have in order
to facilitate transfer of
asset value between chains but it should
be built in ideal way should be built in
a way where it's a neutral it's not just
one way direction only for other chain
to transfer value inwards into one chain
and not
the other way around
so if it can be built in a neutral way i
think that will be very good for the
whole ecosystem
so if if uh if we can let's say in the
case of everscale right if we have a
dial that have all the widgets that we
can allow cross chain transfer of value
and you have a lot of the features that
can make
the
formation of dao very easy for non-tech
people right people who were running up
cooperatives running you know
traditional companies or web 2 companies
they find it so easy to use your dial
like a wrx or weeks now it's like
setting up a website all the modules are
plug and play right and you can plug and
play and can immediately have a cross
bridge uh feature to allow uh you know
crypto users from other chains to
transfer the assets inwards then i think
it's a very good use is a very good
solution for the problem thank you
christina victor if i can bring a little
bit back to the community itself because
well for me bridges and cross chain
solutions are mainly
technology communications and if we talk
about people and communities
it's more or less the same the idea is
to bring as much as possible as
diversified as possible and in my
opinion creation of a dao
starts from formation of a community and
this is very important
um
point in my opinion because
you will never have
[Music]
solutions that
you want to be promoted according to the
values of your tao if your uh community
is not representative enough
like you would never have i don't know
women projects promoted within a male
dominated dow
or you won't be able to
promote
regional friendly
uh solutions if you have
i don't know americentrism implemented
within your project so formation of a
community
and
the more
adopted we become with the coming of
mass adoption it becomes even more
important so we have to think about the
community that we create and we have to
educate the community that we bring
forward
so dao it's not only engagement in my
opinion but also
exchange of knowledge
and in order to be not
a stupid crowd
we need to all keep learning
and the more people we involve
the more
attentive we should be
which message do we promote
through our community
and which people do we want to see
within our community we want to see
everyone but what are the tools that
makes that that make them
part of this community
part of what we want to
solve part of what
the project is about in terms of
its initial ambitions
yeah that that's interesting idea that
yet that just also came to my mind that
it's not just we
we can look at down as not just the user
engagement tool but also as a feedback
tool to get from our community and
improve our blockchain products that's a
very interesting idea
and i think this is a good motivation to
implement dows in all blockchain
products
i think the last word is this right
i think
very interesting to see whether there's
going to be a dial for stable coin or
dow for cbdc i think the next topic is
going to be interesting because the
current so the community decides whether
we print new money or not you see you
think about it a stable coin is
controlled by who you know the
centralized entity decentralized is
trying to come on board cbdc centralized
is there going to be a double stable
coin let's vote whether the inflation is
too high and make it a little lower
there's better opportunities and then we
we vote nothing happens and we say oh
okay sorry
didn't work again
last word sure
so i think with uh
dao we have the same
situation as
a 3.0 versus
web 2.0 uh ui ux is not there yet as
such we see
low turnout in voting
and
we need
solutions which would be
very convenient and something very crisp
and easy for people to grasp what
they're voting on
and how it would impact the
the community and the dao
there will be a lot of evolution uh the
traditional legal system took hundreds
of years to form uh so the legal system
corporations how it works
and the i think the next iteration would
be how dows interact between each other
because
you have lawyers everywhere right for
any contract you spend months to agree
on something
and
it is still not kind of
possible to do it between two dollars
right how who would do that right
and
as such
dao
is a great thing
that would
allow any organization to evolve get the
feedback from from the community even if
there is a law turnout or there are
whales who will over vote anyone still
everyone will see a very very
transparent way where the money would be
spent
and how the funds are allocated and see
the feedback of the community if they
vote against something or repeatedly ask
for something
i think even the big stakeholders will
take it into account in decision making
let's see i think we'll have a lot of
position endowed in the next three years
yeah it's true and let's thank the
speakers first
with the yeah round of applause
thank you guys what a pleasant
discussion yeah uh okay and now we have
uh a special guest coming with to us
