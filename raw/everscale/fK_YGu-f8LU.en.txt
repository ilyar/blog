hello everyone and welcome to
greater bay area blockchain week i'm
olga yarzewski head of content for an
exchange group and you're mc today
this panel is quite special for the
event agenda as
it is aimed at answering a very
important blockchain question
how to bridge the permissioned and
permissionless worlds
and to address this we have an amazing
set of experts sitting on this panel
today
let me do a quick round of introductions
he found a
ceo of red day technology one of the
four founding members of the blockchain
based service network bsn hi ifan thank
you for being here
hi everybody hi alexander filatov ceo
and founder of tone labs
hi alexander hi great to be here
thanks for being here dr weishan long
chairman at
digi node initiative hi dr law
good to see you hi everyone pleasure to
be here
thank you and uh han fang zhang senior
engineer at bitu1 blockchain it's one of
the networks which have recently joined
the bsn hi hankfang
hi everyone thank you so much again for
coming together for this panel well i
would like
uh to start with you ifan since we've
had a very interesting talk
at hong kong blockchain week in november
a lot has happened for bsn and
i have to say it is rapidly turning into
a major infrastructure that is actually
used by
projects and developers worldwide and
um i know that to ensure that and to
comply with the chinese regulation the
bsn is actually split into two
which is the chinese domestic version
that supports
uh permissioned or enterprise
blockchains and the international net
network right which includes
public blockchains also so can you
please tell us what is happening with
bsn now
and um what are you doing to drive
blockchain adoption
in china and worldwide okay uh
that that's a very good question but uh
let me class uh clarify a little bit
it's a psn still one ps network
we just displayed the governance of bsn
into two parts
appears in china which means the
governor
anything everything happens on on
on ps and inside time and the biasing
international
governs the the uh anything related to
bsn outside china it's just like
internet right in china there's a
central
central government agency to govern
internet
but in the usa is another agency you
know
in the u.s so but it's still one
internet
so one psn so yeah uh but the
the reason for that uh split up because
the the regulations in china
it doesn't support public chain and it
doesn't support cryptocurrency
so by the outside we need you know
because
biasing integrates all kind of uh
technol blockchain technology so outside
china we can integrate public chains
so and and you know support the public
chains
so uh that's why we split uh governance
supply into two
so and uh since november we already uh
we integrate the you know more
more technology we integrate
the the you know the uh remote public
chains
but most importantly is in china
we launched what we call the open
permission machine
project uh the we call the opb
what opb is is basically because in
china
it's not really you know
legal to basically run the public chain
nodes
okay and and and also which means for
chinese developers
it's really it's actually very
troublesome for them to connect to a
public team
and under and and they cannot buy
cryptocurrency so
they actually cannot pay for the gas uh
on
on the public chain but because china is
really push for the blockchain
technology and then
you know it's really moved fast you know
therefore the other developer
also can get familiar with this kind of
public exchange environment
development environment public chain so
so
so we will launch the open permission
blockchain
project which is we bring the public
chain
inside china but convert that into a
permission
version and and and take out the
cryptocurrency
and the so-so so chinese developer and
the chinese business
they can use this permission version
of a public exchange environment and to
develop
their own applications uh similar to the
public chain
and because there are no
cryptocurrencies so they pay
the gas with fair money so we need to
build the the gateways payment gateways
everything integrates the traditional
payment system with
a blockchain framework so uh
i think uh uh uh because free tongue is
is the newest member of the opb project
i think uh alex can can talk about that
more
uh next yeah thank you
thank you this is very interesting i
have a quick follow-up question so
um how does psn evaluate projects to
import them and what's the main criteria
for that uh the the first one
is uh it's the device diversify
which means we don't want just use one
uh technology
even with our interchange services we
use two unaware ideas through the third
one the first one
so uh the first one is divide diversify
and the next one is
you know it's really really good for
developer
to develop applications okay that's a
very
very main criteria because there's some
changes
just for for example bitcoins it's
it's insurance you cannot deploy smart
contract on bitcoins there
it cannot be used to develop uh
applications and
you say we don't integrate bitcoin
that chain so so that's the second one
it's a really really you know
and also is the maternity of the chin
uh uh because we really you need
you know not only you have chin you have
the you know all kind of development
tools
you'll have you know uh uh sdks you have
you know everything's ready for for
developers easier to use your chain to
develop
uh applications so uh and for public
chain we
we integrate outside china we actually
looking for you know
the basically the most popular ones the
most people use that
so that that's usually you know we
integrate first
interesting thank you so much thank you
um i would like to uh
stay in um the great bear greater bay
area of china
since it's um the topic of our
conference and let's
now put a spotlight on um this region
and here's to you dr law and can you
please tell us more about the diginode
initiative
and um i know that it's it is a region
specific initiative right well
uh yes and no because this is um uh
a company based in hong kong and we have
exclusive license with bsn
to be the portals for hong kong and
macau
and obviously that will be putting
ourselves
into the center of the quicker bay area
right
so but in theory we are open for
business we want to help bsn to expand
internationally and bridge the gap
between china
and the rest of the world in particular
the one bearing role economy so
we are supposed to um able to serve
everyone uh in the world uh so it's not
only limited to
to the quicker bay area but but
we internally have our interest focus
which is definitely
uh the the hong kong sunshine and the
nearby region
and we also want to focus on fintech
industry
yeah uh sorry let me jump in the
champion a little bit let me explain a
little bit
what's a bsm portal okay so so uh
[Music]
the way we build bison is the
infrastructure so
psn doesn't serve and the user
and the developer direct directly so so
you have to go through a portal
so this portal is it's it's like a front
end of
the psn so but each company can build a
portal
any way they want because they design
and build the front and everything
the process the interface the payment
system the user management
system you can build anywhere you want
we psn
provide apis to the portal so the portal
through the api
to communicate with psn to deploy
a a project to deploy to creations
to to to generate certificates to access
public chains
throughout the apis so all the user
information
stay in the portal uh on bism we don't
have
any personal information from any portal
so there's no
api to collect personal information
so all the users belong to the portal
that's portal spanish
what biases do is support the portal so
so the portal
operator are our customers not under
developers so
thanks for the explanation really it's a
very complex infrastructure and it's
really important to learn and to know
how it works dr la do you have anything
to add i was wondering if
other greater bay area parts will be
joining the network too
other than hong kong and macau
uh as far as i know there are several
other portals in the rest of
the world and bsn will be
growing the presence in
all different parts of the world of
course we want to uh
because of the importance of hong kong
in reaching the
china and the rest of the world so this
particular region
is very important and we are part of
china hong kong is part of china
yet hong kong is a very international
city and a lot of foreigners
with a lot of connection to different
countries so i think we are in a very
good position
to provide a portal service and we are
trying hard to make it easy to use
and and and for people to we are
organizing
and promoting the communities so we are
focusing helping
developers to build something on top of
bsn
all right it's interesting thank you um
well
alexander now to you well first of all
thanks so much for being here
uh it's great to have you and can you
update us on what's been happening uh
since
uh freetown got abandoned by telegram
can you tell us more about the situation
in the developers community sure
sure well the freedom was launched in
may last year
as a decentralized community-driven
network uh
and it evolved since then we have more
than 400
validators and uh we enjoy you know
relatively large community and very
quickly growing we see about three
thousand developers in our ecosystem
and we love integration with bsm because
i'm a big believer that
permissionless and permissioned you know
technology
should coexist their mission list is
more open it's more like
revolution and permission is more like
an evolution
you know and typically governments and
enterprises don't like revolutions they
prefer you know
logical technological evolutions so i
think once you breach the two
you get beauties of the two worlds you
allow governments
you know to get comfortable with the
technology and control what they would
like to control
uh you know and then you allow uh you
allow developers in china outside of
china
access to technology which is very
scalable we can talk about that if it's
of any interest
uh to get access to the developer tools
that simplify development
yet be fully compliant with local
regulations so this is
we love this project this is interesting
you know because
usually uh permissioned and
permissionless
speakers i mean um don't really support
a
friendship narrative it's usually like
an
agreement let me just let me just stay
on my philosophy for a second
first of all of course i mean
permissionless is
uh is the future because it's more open
you know
it engages you know more people it's
easier people love
freedom that there is nobody to control
however again
governments and enterprises you know
don't typically like that stuff
uh and uh what i also like about bsn
project
is that typically in the blockchain
space people
focus on the first use case which is you
know cryptocurrency transfers b2b
transfers
because cryptocurrencies are not allowed
in china
it means that the developers will focus
on more like
let's call it enterprise applications
and use cases that don't necessarily
engage cryptocurrency
but you know leverage the power of the
smart smart contract technology
whereas execute some business logic you
know transparency and whatever
so i think what china is going to bring
to the global blockchain table
is a lot of non-crypto projects more
like in the in the business logic and
enterprise
uh and i think that's great because
typically people tend to focus you know
on the most obvious ones around
cryptocurrencies you know
wallets exchanges taxes etc etc
so i think we're just going to see you
know very unique innovation
coming out of china and that's why we
love that they would have access to
technology as well
in addition to that chinese government
recently increased
investment into digital innovative
projects and that includes
blockchain too okay um
well um i would love to uh hear
uh from hankfang uh and um
can you please tell us more what is
bitiwan technology
and i know that the big one bsn
collaboration happened in november
right and what this partnership is
mainly aimed at
and what are the results so far
are you in you tanking
uh hello can you hear me
yes okay uh let me
just give a briefly introduce about the
bun champ
uh we established the project at 2014
and uh we launched the first dtn champ
at 2018.
right now we have more than 15
decentralized applications running on
our feature
mentioned and our clients from different
level from start company to larger scan
company
and also to some project servers
our local government uh
so the bitcoin chain is a very
uh high performance low cost
and uh public chain and uh
we give a very smoothly developer
experience to
other developers uh it's just a
like feminine always a two way over
there you can build your own blockchain
and uh we we don't actually
we we now only focus on the
public change so but we get a lot of
inspires
by uh let's miss mr kerr
the bsn the
what you said about the connect between
uh
the promised and the permanentes
blockchain project is very inspiring and
i think we were more nation
about that so the portfolio mentioned
i think it's very good solution if
we have that tools we may
try to like be the summer connect
to other blockchain projects as well as
the data translation is safe and it's
sync
so uh right now the btn chain
uh we have a very good speed
the tps's around the 300 and
we offer easter material uh
virtual machine and the way over java
uh virtual machine and also go land and
we're working on
uh invest more popular language into our
system like javascript
all the things and we have a system that
is a uh self-developed uh uh
it's called the milky chain it's same
concept from
the polka's parachute but we achieve it
different way and
which way to actually early than polka
so i think this is a brilliant
introduction if you have any questions
you can ask me
anyone wants to follow up on the event
you want to pull up in this
collaboration with the public
blockchain yeah so outside china on bsc
international we integrate public chains
so the purpose is uh
for developers obviously one gateway can
access
thousands change so it's cheaper easier
and
you know it's it's uh it's just
convenient for for developers if you
want to build a smart exchange
small wallet you know just just one
gateway you
you got iris so uh so uh uh uh
uh bitcoin is one of the the chin we
integrate as
they are from china and also they are
actually
i think they have the permission version
he just doesn't want to yeah
it's closer so he has one and
so it's uh it's uh uh under under the
company i actually is a very very
well-known
uh staff okay black action stuff in
china
uh and they have that like so the worst
six
you know the most uh patents regarding
blockchain
in the world probably just behind the
ali group
so it's a very famous company in china
interesting well congratulations on a
great collaboration
um speaking from the developer side and
i love that you mentioned actually the
cost of developing public chain
applications
sometimes it's not affordable for
developers and
what can be done to reduce this cost and
i would like to first address that
question with alexander
what's been happening in the developers
community is this a
problem sure well what we build at
friton by way i mean like broad
developer community not just on labs
which is a core
developer is we build a whole what we
call operating system
which is essentially a breach between
the blockchain protocol itself
which is more of like a decentralized
microprocessor speaking you know
computer science language
and then whatever sits on top and
bridges to developers and uh
and final users we typically call it
operating system so we call it
it includes a whole bunch of tools for
developers you know we have
a very comprehensive software
development kit we have two compilers
one first solidity which is obviously
the most popular
language so far being used in ethereum
uh we have one
llvm compiler which is cnc plus plus
compatible
sdk by the way supports 20 computer
languages
and we have a whole bunch of bindings
you know with graphql with databases
which simplify development and the idea
is to um
you know create the firebase like
experience
remember in mobile applications until
firebase came along
it was very expensive and difficult to
build mobile applications
and the firebase basically remove the
need for the whole back-end so you would
just you know focus on the front-end
and user experience so that's what our
return os brings to the plate as well
um i can give you one example we
released last week
a technology called dbots which is like
a smart contract
that bridges uh basically bridges the
front end with the back end
trying to simplify my language and we
announced like an official contest for
the first debate
and the first the winner came in 25
minutes i mean 25 minutes from
technology released
to the first debate so we think it's
going to be very powerful
in an unleashed load of innovation in
the space and also bring developers from
the
non-blockchain space uh which i think is
very much needed if we want
blockchain that great technology to take
off
a growing audience amazing iphone what
about
what do you have to say about this
you're mute
sorry uh you know therefore you know
developer can
you know develop applications cheaply
one solution is take out the
cryptocurrency
okay just just think about the public
chain as a decentralized
specialized the crown services so you
can deploy your application
you know you just pay the fair money for
the resources
i mean just remember public kitchen is
not all about the cryptocurrency
it's a decentralized infrastructure
people can
build the application on and communicate
easily transfer data easily and securely
so if because the public machine
has cryptocurrencies so you can see most
most almost 99
of the application is built around
cryptocurrency
that means that means how can public
chain
be used to solve traditional i.t
problems
so i and because we talked with all the
large corporations
banks the problem with with the diplo
traditional i.t application on public
chain is
the money they they make for traditional
ideas
is a fair man but if they deploy the
application on public
chain they pay cryptocurrency fair money
cryptocurrency they cannot control the
cost
so the one solution is take out
cryptocurrency
and use ceremonies so for traditional
i.t system
they make money in fair money and pay
the cost in
money then balance okay so that's
actually
we we talked with alex that's actually
we are testing
this concept with open permission
because in china we take out the
cryptocurrency
right and then you pay the fair money
for the gas
and deploy your traditional application
to solve traditional
problems without cryptocurrency so
that's
actually one concept i really need you
know
to everybody needs to explore which
means
in the future there will be public
change just supporting cbd6
and fair money but of course i i think
most
public chain probably including the free
time if you
ask you know a public chain without
cryptocurrency sometimes
it's no longer a public chain because a
lack of
the the you know the the the the best
things of the public chain
so but but there's needs for the simple
cloud services decentralize the cloud
services
so i i think there will be a niche
market there yeah
yes i agree with that myself is a
believer of a bitcoin and ether
and i got my first bitcoin at 2012
after that these are come out with the
capability to carry data
that's for developers let's say it's
cutting edge
after ether there are a lot of a new
project new tech
release on blockchain community it's
very exciting
but the problem is that most of the
new tech there's a star project they are
way too expensive for individual
developer or small company
like uh for polka
the parrot the pair chant how much he
gonna
pay for that part only the deposit
i heard is around a hundred thousand
dollar
yeah and for easter version two how much
you're gonna deposit it's big amount
easier that stopped people to even try
to build something on this public chain
that's why we view the btn chain
let's say it's a one purpose will be the
btn chain with over same
servers but with much lower cost
how much is going to cost the um btn
chain if you want to build some
decentralized application on btn chain
costs nothing right now you only have
to pay your servers that's
you always need to pay your service fee
and
after that the only thing you need to
pay is the translation fee
the transition fee the bitten chain is a
multi-chain architecture which means
all the transition that's happened on
your
apparent channel it's not gonna cost
you anything the transition phase only
happens when you sync your data from
your parent chain to the main chain
and we have a promotion for all the
smart team and developers that use
ptn channel as base to view the
decentralized application
we will offer more than 10 000 btn
as a stark foundation that will cover
all the
transition fees for a very long time so
basically
right now you use btn chains totally
free whatever is help you
build your old chair and you can release
your application on that chain and
about today's topic the uh
permission and the permission leads
btns is only focused on the public chain
right now
but the architecture of a big chain
chain
is a mutation is keratin architecture
which means we are we can
easily connect to other blockchain if
it's necessary
actually we have an upgrade in the
middle of last year
after the upgrade the btns user
developer can easily do the cross-chain
transition to other public chain like
bitcoin
ether we will cover more at the in the
future
and uh yeah between btn where
we'll be very glad to be the bridge
to communicate to towards
the permission word and the permission
is word
interesting dr law what about this uh
hybrid model
adoption in in hong kong since this is
international hub
yeah yes i i i agree with uh mr her
about this point um take for example
argo rent
which is one of the promising uh um
permissionless train invented by the
famous
mit professor turning award winner
and they go into china and they go as a
opv right open permission blockchain
and the the the
lack of the algo within china forcing
them to
focus or experiment with maybe
in the future with the dcep from china
to substitute that
and make it into a very stable
value when you you don't have to uh
worry about the fluctuation in this
in the exchange market about
the value right and and that i think is
open
for a lot of niche application for the
future for people to explore that
and if that will further accelerate the
development
of dcep because the tcp is not only
used in regular retail payment
on all this usage but also in a lot of
new
interesting blockchain applications i
think that is actually very good
so i really agree with that point of
view
now on the other side i also think it's
interesting to look at
this is algorand going from outside into
china but the
opposite direction i think is also um
becoming
um the future uh trends
for example i see some of the very
famous um
permission blockchain live because in
china
which is uh quite widely adopted now
because
they are not allowed to do uh
permissionless blockchain in china so
they
force them to do it outside china if
there's a need
if they can use hong kong as a place to
launch it and use the hong kong
developers that's our hope that we will
attract a lot to developer to help to
build this
application and this new application in
the future
could be something interesting to
combine some of the
permissioned nature in china and the
permission less
nature outside china now a lot of new
innovation i think could happen in the
future
using that hybrid model so i'm very
optimistic about this kind of trends
and let me jump in a little bit so
but for bsn we are integrating our
blockchain technology so we
we we actually is neutral okay we
integrate
public chain within integrated
permission machine
so we see a lot of us cases so we see
there's a need for open permission in
china and
also we see a need for non
you know cryptocurrency public exchange
worldwide
so i really hope some company pay
attention to this
and develop something they can come to
us okay we can put some money in and
develop this publication without
cryptocurrency so there's a
publishing with cryptocurrency there are
publishing without
cryptocurrency there are open permission
machine
okay uh permission version of public
change and there is
purely permission machine all together
in the grid on bsn and how you can use
those technologies go through meet
professor lowe's portal
okay go to the portal and you can all
use all those streams
together that's how we link everybody
together
posters machines and developers and the
cloud resources we also integrate all
the core resources
onto psn now speaking of
links so during this event gpa
blockchain week we've been
actually talking a lot with speakers
about interoperability
and the importance of cross-chain
features are there any services
represented for cross-chain needs in
in bsn and what is the main challenge
here
actually uh actually there's two uh two
major points why we even do bsn the
first one is
reduce the cost like everybody even high
school students they can access to
blockchain technology okay
it should be very cheap to build the
privacy and the tests all
it should be very cheap to access any
public chain and
they can test you know the technology so
so that's
that's the first point the second one
actually is the interpretability
because we consider right now uh no
matter if it's privacy
or a public chain they are like internet
in the early 1990s
okay because eventually they should link
together
the data flows from one chain to
inaudible
in the 1990s from one internet to
another
internet it become internet then you
know we all see how internet changed
everything in our life so i think
eventually there will be something
to connect all the chains for example
from
a smart contract from one chain to call
another smart contract on
another chain to transfer assets to
transfer data should be very very easy
so so so that's why one major
major focus of bsn is
to build the interoperability within bsn
just remember within bison we have ides
for anything
we have ids for any smart contract we
have ids for you know all the
you know data centers so we can easily
to find other genes
on the open internet it's hard to find
other things
to connect with but within bsn
environment it's much easier to do
so we are doing a lot of research and
working with
you know like pogba cosmos all those
companies try to build
some uh ambiance and a system level
protocol which means you don't need to
change any layer one you don't even need
to deploy a smart contract on your chain
and call a local particle and connect
with
other chains it is not there yet we are
still you know working in progress
well that's a very important work anyway
alex what about
what can you say about interoperability
it's one of the
major issues for the developers
communities of course
we were big fans we already have a
bridge with
we're currently in integration with bsn
as dr eufan mentioned we have a breach
with ethereum
we're finalizing by the way i always
mean community developer community
finalizing the bridge to polka dot uh
teslas
uh and a few other networks you know in
certain sequence
uh and i think like if you want to think
about it philosophically
i think blockchain already passed what
you know we call the netscape moment
in iit industry netscape moment if we go
back to 1994
is when users discover that using
internet is relatively simple
you know when netscape navigator came
out but i don't think we yet had a an
iphone moment
and an iphone moment in 2007 is when
people said okay it's so cool that i
gotta have it
and i don't think we're there yet
because you know chain is exponential
and i think interoperability is one of
the keys to getting to the
iphone moment a little bit faster you
know maybe in the next couple of years
to be optimistic so that everyone wants
to have their own blockchain
not the blockchain but that people
wouldn't because obviously blockchain
brings
benefits you know uh that we all know
like transparency you know immutability
the trust if it's permission link is
permissionless as well
and but it had downsides you know
technologies couldn't deliver
scalability uh that is required and also
the level of adoption
and user experience but now it's there
the tools are there
you know ui ux is their performances
there for example
in our chain the blocks are formed in
0.2 seconds
because of the dynamic charging or
multi-threading to be more precise
and that's very fast no that's good for
fintech that's good for any gaming
application
so uh it's getting there and i think it
will start
biting market share away from
centralized i.t
uh i mean i mean decentralized software
and what bsn is doing in china is
actually one of the way to accelerate
that you know that adoption uh wherever
it makes sense obviously from
you know centralized classical a.t to a
more decentralized
um so centralized
nature and decentralized nature actually
can and must coexist
after all um by the way
i as you know it is often said that if
you even question yourself
if you need blockchain then most
probably you don't need it
in your you know in your company in the
innovative program
what can you say about the um enterprise
adoption because
enterprise use is very important how do
you assess the speed of this adoption is
it
really easy now to implement blockchain
into enterprise or commercial systems
in china and outside of china or big
companies are still very slow to do it
yeah i i mean it's like alex
just said it's very very early right now
right now it's like
1993 of the internet most people still
you know at that time you say internet
why were you even using internet what's
what's the internet then in 1995 people
say what's internet is the email
okay that simplest application email is
the internet
so after 30 years you'll see how the
internet changes
the whole world all the business logics
all the business scenarios all the
business
process but remember on in china
until 2005 the big financial
institutions and the governments begin
to use the internet to serve people
okay 10 years 10 years after
1995. so so so blockchain technology
will be quicker
but it still takes a while okay right
now people say what's blockchain
technology crypto cryptocurrency because
it's
the simplest application
um based on blockchain technology
but remember all the company
all the banks even right now many many
individual developers
explore the blockchain technology to try
to build
you know the the the blockchain
technology decentralized the concept
into their commercial it system so so
there will be
many many user cases and that will also
push
to improve the the underlying framework
you know just like
i said there will be many many times you
know with crypto
currency results and the permission
chain
and the hybrid chain like half
permission
and you know some kind of you know
public kind of governance some kind of
design
so so i i i think there will be many
type but uh
but i i think i need the three years
three to five years
really really to reach you know a mess
you know begin the mass adoption under
the
cbd6 and the digital currency will help
will help
dr law do you agree with this evaluation
three to five years
plus a cbdc well
uh china's cbdc will be coming out very
soon will be less than maybe one or two
years
if my information is correct um
i think another trend pushing this
faster is
this early stage of institutional now
uh putting the treasury and buying
bitcoin as a
as a reserve and that trend
is is now starting to spread to
some other companies right and if you
think about this if
uh international company multinational
start to adopt and realize they can buy
bitcoin and hold it and use it for for
for reserve purpose the next question
they will think about is what other
blockchain technology we can use right
so this
um i think have a very positive uh
effect in the mindset
because previously still a lot of people
think oh this is uh this is not
legitimate
this is um this is a policy scheme this
is uh worth nothing they will collapse
all this kind of doubt i think was
influencing a lot of my share and with
this
um kind of a new trend i think
we will have a positive uh event uh an
effect
on the adoption on blockchain in big
companies now
i also want to echo one thing i
mentioned earlier
when in
in the permission world where you want
to
um using cbdc
um to replace the the proper chain
uh currency uh one very good example
is actually that i noticed is actually
in switzerland that they're building one
of the next generation
digital security exchange now this
exchange
is built on quarter technology but they
also
point out the mission is to use the
swiss switzerlands
uh cbdc to be the vehicle for trading
this
digital current digital security in the
future
so this is two step actually using
digital cbdc
and buying digital securities right and
these are both
very big uh impact on our capital
markets
because right exchange with all this
security being tokenized
will be eventually a big thing so that's
the thing that i hope
will eventually trigger to happen in
china as well
when when more use case of the cbdc will
be adopted into
other financial applications so that's
thank you yeah digital securities and
tokenization is another
very big and very hot topic and it
really varies depending on jurisdiction
as far as we know right alex okay
um alex um i'm sorry we are out of time
um i urge you to make your
last point and uh we're gonna just
quickly wrap it up
sure well again we're very excited about
cooperation with bsn
i don't you want to repeat what i said
at the beginning but i think
china like kind of to a large extent
china led
to this kind of payment revolution in
the last 20 years you know
transcending the whole generation of iq
i think china will play a similar
similar role um you know you know in the
blockchain space driving adoption
beyond the cryptocurrencies to the other
use cases and we're
we're very excited to you know welcome
chinese developers on our platform
uh and um we would certainly you know we
would certainly make them happy with our
tools and they would find that
development on the blockchain
can be you know just just a few days i
can give you one example the nft
subject is very hard so when we
introduce the technology for nft tokens
two weeks ago
three weeks ago um in freetown
it took the first it took guys it took
three developers and only two weeks
to come up with the first nft
marketplace on freight on
two weeks three developers and uh you
know they sold their first collection
and made thirty thousand dollars in one
day
isn't that amazing uh so i think
innovation like that will continue to
accelerate
thank you so much well i think we
actually had
several building blocks and that bridge
between permissioned and permissionless
blockchain
being put during this panel thank you so
much everyone for being here today
unfortunately our time is up
but i urge you to enjoy the rest of the
conference we have an amazing content
coming up um if on here everyday
technology alexander vladov of ton labs
