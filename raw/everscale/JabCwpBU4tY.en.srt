this is this is
like ultimate use case because this is

316
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
like ultimate use case because this is
 

317
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,749
like ultimate use case because this is
the most mission critical application

318
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
the most mission critical application
 

319
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,510
the most mission critical application
you can think about

320
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
you can think about
 

321
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,270

uh actually
 

445
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,589
uh actually
and the pipeline grew for last two weeks

446
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
and the pipeline grew for last two weeks
 

447
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,309
and the pipeline grew for last two weeks
the pipeline grew like three times

448

the pipeline grew like three times
 

449
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,149
the pipeline grew like three times
uh we're almost kind of running out of

450
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
uh we're almost kind of running out of
 

451
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,310
uh we're almost kind of running out of
the capacity to to

452
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
the capacity to to
 

453
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,750
the capacity to to
um

454
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
um
 

455
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,070
um

so that um it's really encouraging news
 

459
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,709
so that um it's really encouraging news
i think because of because of the you

460
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
i think because of because of the you
 

461
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,269
i think because of because of the you
know so many projects want to start

462
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
know so many projects want to start
 

463
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,990
know so many projects want to start
uh on on never scale or do something

464
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
uh on on never scale or do something
 

465
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,710
uh on on never scale or do something
with flex or never scale so these are

466
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
with flex or never scale so these are
 

467
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,310
with flex or never scale so these are
these are good

468
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
these are good
 

469
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,110
these are good
but

470
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,120
but
 

471
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,030
but
um

472
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040

 

473
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,829

we are

474
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839

 

475
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,150

not certain

476
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
not certain
 

477
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,389
not certain
on how to proceed right now because of

478
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
on how to proceed right now because of
 

479
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,550
on how to proceed right now because of
the different

480
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
the different
 

481
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,790
the different
because of the uncertainty of the of the

482
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
because of the uncertainty of the of the
 

483
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,870
because of the uncertainty of the of the
flexed economics

484
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:12,880
flexed economics
 

485
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,829
flexed economics
and

486
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
and
 

487
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,750
and
flex business development

488
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
flex business development
 

489
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,910
flex business development
going forward

490
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
going forward
 

491
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,990
going forward
therefore we have to

492
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
therefore we have to
 

493
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,829
therefore we have to
kind

494
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839
kind
 

495
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,310
kind
of um

496
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
of um
 

497
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,590
of um
we will

498
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:23,600
we will
 

499
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,030
we will
we will discuss that probably on the

500
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040
we will discuss that probably on the
 

501
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,630
we will discuss that probably on the
on the call

502
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
on the call
 

503
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,910
on the call
when we'll have the call

504
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920

 

505
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,070

on the first row

506
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
on the first row
 

507
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,470
on the first row
and then we will decide

508
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
and then we will decide
 

509
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,150
and then we will decide
if we

510
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
if we
 

511
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,030
if we
kind of

512
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
kind of
 

513
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,030
kind of
what we're doing with this

514
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,040
what we're doing with this
 

515
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,949
what we're doing with this
situation

516
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:42,959
situation
 

517
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,389
situation
so right now

518
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
so right now
 

519
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,230
so right now
it's um

520
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
it's um
 

521
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,710
it's um
it's not up to us but the cooperation

522
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
it's not up to us but the cooperation
 

523
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,870
it's not up to us but the cooperation
between kwpc

524
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
between kwpc
 

525
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,670
between kwpc
and flex

526
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
and flex
 

527
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,750
and flex
is

528
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
is
 

529
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,350
is
like

530
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,360
like
 

531
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,350
like
is not certain

532
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
is not certain
 

533
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,150
is not certain
we don't understand the status

534
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
we don't understand the status
 

535
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,949
we don't understand the status
and

536
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:02,959
and
 

537
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,030
and
therefore

538
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
therefore
 

539
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,430
therefore
in it's quite hard to kind of you know

540
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
in it's quite hard to kind of you know
 

541
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,710
in it's quite hard to kind of you know
it's uh

542
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
it's uh
 

543
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,150
it's uh
we're um
