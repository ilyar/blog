00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,550
on this stage will be do
all the next three stages why because

and sometimes
 

241
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,990
and sometimes
uh it's impossible to have some

00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
uh it's impossible to have some
 

243
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,670
uh it's impossible to have some
mechanism for example

every participant participants
 

315
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,950
every participant participants
need to give their own

316
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
need to give their own
 

317
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,629
need to give their own
road map for next stage and

318
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
road map for next stage and
 

319
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,149
road map for next stage and
i recommend to discuss it's in

320
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159

323
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,430

uh discuss those stages before

324
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
uh discuss those stages before
 

325
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,030
uh discuss those stages before
the before they put their submissions

326
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
the before they put their submissions
 

327
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,470
the before they put their submissions
in blockchain this is uh that

328
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
in blockchain this is uh that
 

329
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,269
in blockchain this is uh that
very different from previous web video

330
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,279
very different from previous web video
 

331
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:53,990
very different from previous web video
because

332
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
because
 

333
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,230
because
uh that we need to discuss it's good

334
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
uh that we need to discuss it's good
 

335
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,630
uh that we need to discuss it's good
idea or not

336
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
idea or not
 

337
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,829
idea or not
that's okay okay uh

338
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
that's okay okay uh
 

339
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,350
that's okay okay uh
actually uh i agree that uh we need

340
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
actually uh i agree that uh we need
 

341
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,870
actually uh i agree that uh we need
some kind of milestones for

342
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
some kind of milestones for
 

343
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,870
some kind of milestones for
for this contest so it probably it will

344
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
for this contest so it probably it will
 

345
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,230
for this contest so it probably it will
be the same chained cost

346
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
be the same chained cost
 

347
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,110
be the same chained cost
contest as we used to have for bridges

348
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
contest as we used to have for bridges
 

349
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,990
contest as we used to have for bridges
for example

350
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
for example
 

351
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,670
for example
uh uh yeah so we have meter raise hand

352
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
uh uh yeah so we have meter raise hand
 

353
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:19,990
uh uh yeah so we have meter raise hand
so

354

so
 

355
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,190
so
media please yeah well the architectures

356
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
media please yeah well the architectures
 

357
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,590
media please yeah well the architectures
are

358
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:23,600
are
 

359
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,150
are
very different at least from like our

360
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
very different at least from like our
 

361
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,590
very different at least from like our
architecture with andrew

362
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
architecture with andrew
 

363
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,110
architecture with andrew
is very different from like others

364
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
is very different from like others
 

365
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,630
is very different from like others
the question is like okay so we um

366
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
the question is like okay so we um
 

367
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,150
the question is like okay so we um
let's say we uh we do this you know

368
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
let's say we uh we do this you know
 

369
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,670
let's say we uh we do this you know
uh proposal with the stages these stages

370
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
uh proposal with the stages these stages
 

371
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,590
uh proposal with the stages these stages
will be entirely different from

372
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
will be entirely different from
 

373
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,030
will be entirely different from
other participants what you're going to

374
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
other participants what you're going to
 

375
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,150
other participants what you're going to
do with them next

376
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
do with them next
 

377
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,150
do with them next
yeah that's actually the questions that

378
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,160
yeah that's actually the questions that
 

379
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,269
yeah that's actually the questions that
i also had in mind so that uh

380
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
i also had in mind so that uh
 

381
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,350
i also had in mind so that uh
uh i'm not sure if uh there should be

382
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,360
uh i'm not sure if uh there should be
 

383
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,550
uh i'm not sure if uh there should be
three or four maybe

384
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
three or four maybe
 

385
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,990
three or four maybe
only two stages uh so we don't unders we

386
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
only two stages uh so we don't unders we
 

387
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,030
only two stages uh so we don't unders we
won't understand this

388
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
won't understand this
 

389
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,230
won't understand this
and unless the first implementation

390
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
and unless the first implementation
 

391
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,590
and unless the first implementation
is uh is done uh

392
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
is uh is done uh
 

393
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,430
is uh is done uh
maybe maybe we can somehow try to

394
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
maybe maybe we can somehow try to
 

395
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,030
maybe maybe we can somehow try to
uh tackle more generic

396
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
uh tackle more generic
 

397
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,550
uh tackle more generic
stages for each you know

398
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
stages for each you know
 

399
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,590
stages for each you know
each and also stable coins

400
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600
each and also stable coins
 

401
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,829
each and also stable coins
i don't know so the first version was

402
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
i don't know so the first version was
 

403
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,949
i don't know so the first version was
manually uh

404
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
manually uh
 

405
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,750
manually uh
stabilized price second version with i

406
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
stabilized price second version with i
 

407
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,590
stabilized price second version with i
don't know automatic stabilized price

408
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:31,600
don't know automatic stabilized price
 

409
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,790
don't know automatic stabilized price
and third version with

410
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
and third version with
 

411
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,829
and third version with
with dao inside uh i don't know

knitting oracles stable core and ethanol
 

453
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,550
knitting oracles stable core and ethanol
oracles and i think

454
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
oracles and i think
 

455
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,829
oracles and i think
that's a good idea set up

456
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
that's a good idea set up
 

457
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,630
that's a good idea set up
contest for oracle's like independent

458
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
contest for oracle's like independent
 

459
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,190
contest for oracle's like independent
contest

460
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200

of our
 

485
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,150
of our
design for stablecoin is an oracle

486
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,160
design for stablecoin is an oracle
 

487
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,949
design for stablecoin is an oracle
design so that will already cover

488
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959
design so that will already cover
 

489
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,750
design so that will already cover
part of implementation for us and we

490
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
part of implementation for us and we
 

491
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,389
part of implementation for us and we
will

492
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
will
 

493
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,269

00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
the easiest thing is yes to combine
 

527
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,790
the easiest thing is yes to combine
maybe

528
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:50,800
maybe
 

529
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,590
maybe
second and third stage uh the third

530
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
second and third stage uh the third
 

531
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,350
second and third stage uh the third
stage which is finished product

532
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
stage which is finished product
 

533
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,470
stage which is finished product
is i think at this stage it can be even

534
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
is i think at this stage it can be even
 

535
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,030
is i think at this stage it can be even
optional

536
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
optional
 

537
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,550
optional
because we don't know what would be

538
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
because we don't know what would be
 

539
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,870
because we don't know what would be
implemented after the third stage and it

540
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
implemented after the third stage and it
 

541
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,430
implemented after the third stage and it
can be

542
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:03,440
can be
 

543
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,550
can be
changed in the future for sure and i

544
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:06,560
changed in the future for sure and i
 

545
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,069
changed in the future for sure and i
also agree we should make it

546
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
also agree we should make it
 

547
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,829
also agree we should make it
more generic and maybe we should uh

548
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:11,839
more generic and maybe we should uh
 

549
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,710
more generic and maybe we should uh
exclude oracle's from alpha stage but

550
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
exclude oracle's from alpha stage but
 

551
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,829
exclude oracle's from alpha stage but
again a lot of

552
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
again a lot of
 

553
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,470
again a lot of
uh proposals that we've saw on the

554
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
uh proposals that we've saw on the
 

555
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,350
uh proposals that we've saw on the
design

556
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,360
design
 

557
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,949
design
they are heavily dependent on the

558
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
they are heavily dependent on the
 

559
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,710
they are heavily dependent on the
oracles

560
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:22,720
oracles
 

561
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,069
oracles
in my case means that uh stablecoin

562
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
in my case means that uh stablecoin
 

563
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,389
in my case means that uh stablecoin
itself depends on the context for

564
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399
itself depends on the context for
 

565
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,110
itself depends on the context for
oracles

566
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
oracles
 

567
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,350
oracles
if we don't want every participant to

568
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,360
if we don't want every participant to
 

569
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,269
if we don't want every participant to
make his own implementation of the

570
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:33,279
make his own implementation of the
 

571
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,710
make his own implementation of the
oracles

572
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
oracles
 

573
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,430
oracles
so it's a good question to think about

574
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
so it's a good question to think about
 

575
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,310
so it's a good question to think about
for everyone

576
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
for everyone
 

577
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,310
for everyone
should we make this contest dependent on

578
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
should we make this contest dependent on
 

579
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,310
should we make this contest dependent on
the oracle contest or should we try

580
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,320
the oracle contest or should we try
 

581
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,870
the oracle contest or should we try
to generalize and make it more generic

582
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
to generalize and make it more generic
 

583
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,430
to generalize and make it more generic
the healthy stage

584
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
the healthy stage
 

585
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,629
the healthy stage
i agree okay good idea yeah yeah

586
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
i agree okay good idea yeah yeah
 

587
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,670
i agree okay good idea yeah yeah
i really think that we will uh just face

588
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680
i really think that we will uh just face
 

589
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,150
i really think that we will uh just face
some

590
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,160
some
 

591
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,870
some
teams con constraints so as we used to

592
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
teams con constraints so as we used to
 

593
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,189
teams con constraints so as we used to
have

594
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
have
 

595
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,069
have
uh for the dex contest uh that people

596
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
uh for the dex contest uh that people
 

597
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,350
uh for the dex contest uh that people
cannot participate

598
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
cannot participate
 

599
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,150
cannot participate
in both contests at the same time and

600
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160
in both contests at the same time and
 

601
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,470
in both contests at the same time and
there is not so many teams

602
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480
there is not so many teams
 

603
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,590
there is not so many teams
who are able to do this so probably we

604
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
who are able to do this so probably we
 

605
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,790
who are able to do this so probably we
should prioritize

606
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
should prioritize
 

607
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,310
should prioritize
oracle's contest first and

608
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,320
oracle's contest first and
 

609
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,350
oracle's contest first and
right after uh runs the stable

610
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
right after uh runs the stable
 

611
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,430
right after uh runs the stable
contest yes meter please yeah well

612
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,440
contest yes meter please yeah well
 

613
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,189
contest yes meter please yeah well
the thing with with oracle's like um

614
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:27,199

 

615
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,949

do we need to discuss the architecture

616
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:28,959
do we need to discuss the architecture
 

617
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,949
do we need to discuss the architecture
of that first

618
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
of that first
 

619
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,590
of that first
of course we do so we so the contest

620
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
of course we do so we so the contest
 

621
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,509
of course we do so we so the contest
will include like the

622
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
will include like the
 

623
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,150
will include like the
the architecture part should include or

624
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,160
the architecture part should include or
 

625
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,670
the architecture part should include or
just implementation part

626
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680
just implementation part
 

627
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,550
just implementation part
as with june i think we can run a short

628
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560
as with june i think we can run a short
 

629
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,990
as with june i think we can run a short
architecture contest

630
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
architecture contest
 

631
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,189
architecture contest
for just a couple of weeks and

632
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:47,199
for just a couple of weeks and
 

633
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,189
for just a couple of weeks and
get some results because uh i think

634
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199
get some results because uh i think
 

635
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,310
get some results because uh i think
that's for oracle's

636
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
that's for oracle's
 

637
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,750
that's for oracle's
part uh it's not more complex than the

638
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:53,760
part uh it's not more complex than the
 

639
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,949
part uh it's not more complex than the
dex contest

640
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
dex contest
 

641
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,550
dex contest
and uh arguably but

642
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560

 

643
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,949

for me like i of course prefer because i

644
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
for me like i of course prefer because i
 

645
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,389
for me like i of course prefer because i
will participate in the architecture

646
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:04,399
will participate in the architecture
 

647
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,150
will participate in the architecture
because i think i know how to like

648
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,160
because i think i know how to like
 

649
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,189
because i think i know how to like
do that but uh you know and but that of

650
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,199
do that but uh you know and but that of
 

651
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,550
do that but uh you know and but that of
course it depends on

652
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
course it depends on
 

653
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,389
course it depends on
then how the contest should be drafted

654
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
then how the contest should be drafted
 

655
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,910
then how the contest should be drafted
so if there is a

656
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:13,920
so if there is a
 

657
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,389
so if there is a
first stage with a is there architecture

658
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:16,399
first stage with a is there architecture
 

659
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,710
first stage with a is there architecture
then then i will just draft this part

660
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
then then i will just draft this part
 

661
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,790
then then i will just draft this part
the contest and we'll be very proud yeah

662
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
the contest and we'll be very proud yeah
 

663
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,550
the contest and we'll be very proud yeah
i think i think that's the right uh

664
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
i think i think that's the right uh
 

665
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,670
i think i think that's the right uh
right step

666
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:23,680
right step
 

667
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,790
right step
what do you think guys

668
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
what do you think guys
 

669
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,990
what do you think guys
i as our pre prior

670
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
i as our pre prior
 

671
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,069

experience shows that architecture

672
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:32,079
experience shows that architecture
 

673
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,150
experience shows that architecture
contests they always give

674
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160
contests they always give
 

675
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,790
contests they always give
great insights for every other team on

676
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,800
great insights for every other team on
 

677
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,310
great insights for every other team on
them green day stage so

678
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
them green day stage so
 

679
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,030
them green day stage so
if we have time then it's always good to

680
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
if we have time then it's always good to
 

681
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,710
if we have time then it's always good to
have an architecture

682
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:42,720
have an architecture
 

683
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,310
have an architecture
before implementation okay

684
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
before implementation okay
 

685
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,110
before implementation okay
then a deal good meet can you please

686
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,120
then a deal good meet can you please
 

687
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,990
then a deal good meet can you please
draft the

688
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,000
draft the
 

689
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,189
draft the
architecture contest for oracle yes sure

690
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:53,199
architecture contest for oracle yes sure
 

691
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,550
architecture contest for oracle yes sure
yeah and we will discard this uh

692
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
yeah and we will discard this uh
 

693
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,949
yeah and we will discard this uh
okay any other opinions

694
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:02,959

 

695
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,470

no very good uh okay so

696
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,480
no very good uh okay so
 

697
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,310
no very good uh okay so
now we will uh start with

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,870
just share with you my thoughts and
maybe some

1382
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:26,880
maybe some
 

1383
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,029
maybe some
some other guys have other opinion in

1384
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:29,039
some other guys have other opinion in
 

1385
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,710
some other guys have other opinion in
fact uh we are right now

1386
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:30,720
fact uh we are right now
 

1387
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,350
fact uh we are right now
in quite uh you know as you said vague

1388
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:33,360
in quite uh you know as you said vague
 

1389
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,389
in quite uh you know as you said vague
environment so

1390
00:32:34,389 --> 00:32:34,399
environment so
 

1391
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,070
environment so
we don't know what will be exactly

1392
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,080
we don't know what will be exactly
 

1393
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,070
we don't know what will be exactly
implemented uh on the first stage that's

1394
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,080
implemented uh on the first stage that's
 

1395
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,029
implemented uh on the first stage that's
why there are

1396
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:39,039
why there are
 

1397
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,870
why there are
all these milestones they are quite a

1398
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:40,880
all these milestones they are quite a
 

1399
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,149
all these milestones they are quite a
draft ones

1400
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:42,159
draft ones
 

1401
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,389
draft ones
and of course they can change over the

1402
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:44,399
and of course they can change over the
 

1403
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,830
and of course they can change over the
time so uh

1404
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:45,840
time so uh
 

1405
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,430
time so uh
we will have a look at which solutions

1406
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:49,440
we will have a look at which solutions
 

1407
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,710
we will have a look at which solutions
will be the winning ones and also

1408
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:52,720
will be the winning ones and also
 

1409
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,870
will be the winning ones and also
later discuss what will be the next

1410
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:54,880
later discuss what will be the next
 

1411
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,990
later discuss what will be the next
stages for

1412
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,000
stages for
 

1413
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,029
stages for
for this contest uh because

1414
00:32:59,029 --> 00:32:59,039
for this contest uh because
 

1415
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,470
for this contest uh because
as shows the practice uh everything may

1416
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:02,480
as shows the practice uh everything may
 

1417
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,350
as shows the practice uh everything may
change very

1418
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:03,360
change very
 

1419
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,909
change very
very quickly and if we have drafted

1420
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:07,919
very quickly and if we have drafted
 

1421
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,029
very quickly and if we have drafted
some milestones that we currently see

1422
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:11,039
some milestones that we currently see
 

1423
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:11,990
some milestones that we currently see
them assist

1424
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,000
them assist
 

1425
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,230
them assist
so they may may change after the

1426
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:14,240
so they may may change after the
 

1427
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,669
so they may may change after the
implementation stage

1428
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:15,679
implementation stage
 

1429
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,470
implementation stage
this is pretty much what's happening

1430
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:18,480
this is pretty much what's happening
 

1431
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,350
this is pretty much what's happening
with bridges

1432
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:19,360
with bridges
 

1433
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,630
with bridges
so although we uh try to stick to all

1434
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:22,640
so although we uh try to stick to all
 

1435
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,870
so although we uh try to stick to all
these milestones that were initially

1436
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:24,880
these milestones that were initially
 

1437
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,549
these milestones that were initially
drafted we see that something

1438
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:28,559
drafted we see that something
 

1439
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,029
drafted we see that something
shouldn't be done something should be

1440
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:31,039
shouldn't be done something should be
 

1441
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,630
shouldn't be done something should be
added to that

1442
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:32,640
added to that
 

1443
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,909
added to that
so i propose to discuss after this the

1444
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:35,919
so i propose to discuss after this the
 

1445
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:36,870
so i propose to discuss after this the
first stage

1446
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:36,880
first stage
 

1447
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,029
first stage
has ended yes i wanted to add that

1448
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:41,039
has ended yes i wanted to add that
 

1449
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,070
has ended yes i wanted to add that
uh we are also we are looking at two

1450
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:44,080
uh we are also we are looking at two
 

1451
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,350
uh we are also we are looking at two
things that the results

1452
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:45,360
things that the results
 

1453
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,909
things that the results
of course of the first stage and they

1454
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:47,919
of course of the first stage and they
 

1455
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:48,710
of course of the first stage and they
will

1456
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:48,720
will
 

1457
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,310
will
might affect the

1458
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:52,320
might affect the
 

1459
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,110
might affect the
draft of the second stage because we

1460
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,120
draft of the second stage because we
 

1461
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,310
draft of the second stage because we
have to see what

1462
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:56,320
have to see what
 

1463
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,190
have to see what
what were the we who were the winners

1464
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,200
what were the we who were the winners
 

1465
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,070
what were the we who were the winners
the best

1466
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,080
the best
 

1467
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,430
the best
uh approaches etc that's why uh it was

1468
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:03,440
uh approaches etc that's why uh it was
 

1469
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:03,830
uh approaches etc that's why uh it was
very

1470
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:03,840
very
 

1471
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,269
very
vague uh vaguely described

1472
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:07,279
vague uh vaguely described
 

1473
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,510
vague uh vaguely described
in the document and the second thing we

1474
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:09,520
in the document and the second thing we
 

1475
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,629
in the document and the second thing we
have to

1476
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:10,639
have to
 

1477
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,990
have to
prioritize it with uh stable context

1478
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,000
prioritize it with uh stable context
 

1479
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,869
prioritize it with uh stable context
because we

1480
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:14,879
because we
 

1481
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,190
because we
again don't want to mix those contents

1482
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:17,200
again don't want to mix those contents
 

1483
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,470
again don't want to mix those contents
together

1484
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:18,480
together
 

1485
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,510
together
in terms of uh timelines we want them to

1486
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:21,520
in terms of uh timelines we want them to
 

1487
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,190
in terms of uh timelines we want them to
be separate because we know there are

1488
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:23,200
be separate because we know there are
 

1489
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,470
be separate because we know there are
several teams who

1490
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:24,480
several teams who
 

1491
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,030
several teams who
want to participate in both so we have

1492
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:27,040
want to participate in both so we have
 

1493
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,470
want to participate in both so we have
to prioritize

1494
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:28,480
to prioritize
 

1495
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,950
to prioritize
uh and i think that the second stage

1496
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:30,960
uh and i think that the second stage
 

1497
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,510
uh and i think that the second stage
will be

1498
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:31,520
will be
 

1499
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,510
will be
right after the stable coin i

1500
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:33,520
right after the stable coin i
 

1501
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,349
right after the stable coin i
implementation stage so we

1502
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:35,359
implementation stage so we
 

1503
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,149
implementation stage so we
will have plenty of time to discuss it

1504
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:38,159
will have plenty of time to discuss it
 

1505
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,790
will have plenty of time to discuss it
and

1506
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:38,800
and
 

1507
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,069
and
sum up with the best possible draft for

1508
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:42,079
sum up with the best possible draft for
 

1509
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,710
sum up with the best possible draft for
all the teams

1510
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:44,720
all the teams
 

1511
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,669
all the teams
okay so yeah did i get can you hear me

1512
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:47,679
okay so yeah did i get can you hear me
 

1513
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,149
okay so yeah did i get can you hear me
now

1514
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:48,159
now
 

1515
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,470
now
yeah sure yeah did i get it right so

1516
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:50,480
yeah sure yeah did i get it right so
 

1517
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,669
yeah sure yeah did i get it right so
first uh

1518
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:51,679
first uh
 

1519
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,790
first uh
the voting for the first stage

1520
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:54,800
the voting for the first stage
 

1521
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,510
the voting for the first stage
ends then there's some discussion time

1522
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:57,520
ends then there's some discussion time
 

1523
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,230
ends then there's some discussion time
and

1524
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:58,240
and
 

1525
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,349
and
some time for the stablecoin contest

1526
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:01,359
some time for the stablecoin contest
 

1527
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,230
some time for the stablecoin contest
so that it doesn't get mixed with the

1528
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:04,240
so that it doesn't get mixed with the
 

1529
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,270
so that it doesn't get mixed with the
with the stage two

1530
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:05,280
with the stage two
 

1531
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,990
with the stage two
right and only then there is stage two

1532
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:08,000
right and only then there is stage two
 

1533
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,030
right and only then there is stage two
for the decks

1534
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,040
for the decks
 

1535
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,589
for the decks
right yes yes more or less i think so

1536
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:11,599
right yes yes more or less i think so
 

1537
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,270
right yes yes more or less i think so
it's my proposal but

1538
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:13,280
it's my proposal but
 

1539
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,950
it's my proposal but
that's how how i do it yeah we will see

1540
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:16,960
that's how how i do it yeah we will see
 

1541
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,630
that's how how i do it yeah we will see
actually we will see so uh because there

1542
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:18,640
actually we will see so uh because there
 

1543
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,150
actually we will see so uh because there
is also the oracle's contest that we

1544
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,160
is also the oracle's contest that we
 

1545
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,870
is also the oracle's contest that we
discussed

1546
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:20,880
discussed
 

1547
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,310
discussed
earlier and uh maybe

1548
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:24,320
earlier and uh maybe
 

1549
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,349
earlier and uh maybe
we will decide that we should not wait

1550
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:27,359
we will decide that we should not wait
 

1551
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,470
we will decide that we should not wait
for too long and

1552
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:28,480
for too long and
 

1553
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,510
for too long and
announce the second stage as well uh

1554
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:31,520
announce the second stage as well uh
 

1555
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,109
announce the second stage as well uh
but yeah so i think it's it's worth to

1556
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:35,119
but yeah so i think it's it's worth to
 

1557
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,510
but yeah so i think it's it's worth to
to wait for one week to er for the first

1558
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:37,520
to wait for one week to er for the first
 

1559
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,730
to wait for one week to er for the first
stage to end and

1560
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:38,740
stage to end and
 

1561
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,990
stage to end and

then discuss it precisely okay

1564
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:43,280
then discuss it precisely okay
 

1565
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,349

1567
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,630

what is the second stage that's exactly

1568
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:50,640
what is the second stage that's exactly
 

1569
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,589
what is the second stage that's exactly
what anzuro asks

1570
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:53,599
what anzuro asks
 

1571
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,069
what anzuro asks
like we don't have any second stage we

1572
00:35:56,069 --> 00:35:56,079
like we don't have any second stage we
 

1573
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:56,950
like we don't have any second stage we
didn't know

1574
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:56,960
didn't know
 

1575
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,150
didn't know
we have amm which is okay

1576
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:00,160
we have amm which is okay
 

1577
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,750
we have amm which is okay
which is kind of almost ready next week

1578
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:03,760
which is kind of almost ready next week
 

1579
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,230
which is kind of almost ready next week
is that the amm should be the next stage

1580
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,240
is that the amm should be the next stage
 

1581
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,630
is that the amm should be the next stage
yes it's the

1582
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:08,640
yes it's the
 

1583

let's do it
 

1585
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,670
let's do it
we can do it without them well according

1586
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:15,680
we can do it without them well according
 

1587
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,790
we can do it without them well according
to the road map

1588
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:16,800
to the road map
 

1589
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,589
to the road map
uh which i'm looking at right now that's

1590
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:19,599
uh which i'm looking at right now that's
 

1591
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,670
uh which i'm looking at right now that's
listed in the stage one contest

1592
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:21,680
listed in the stage one contest
 

1593

the second stage is uh devoted to
 

1595
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,710
the second stage is uh devoted to

complex liquidity pool mechanics
 

1597
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,550

market maker mechanics
 

1601
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,790
market maker mechanics
which doesn't really make that much

1602
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:32,800
which doesn't really make that much
 

1603

at least i mean it's all like the
 

1607
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,190
at least i mean it's all like the
advanced functionality of dex and it it

1608
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:39,200
advanced functionality of dex and it it
 

1609
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,990
advanced functionality of dex and it it
doesn't look like

1610
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,000
doesn't look like
 

1611
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,510
doesn't look like

the topic of the criteria for for this
 

1645
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,870
the topic of the criteria for for this
first stage as well as for me personally

first stage as well as for me personally
 

1647
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,910
first stage as well as for me personally
uh i think they're not

1648
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:29,920
uh i think they're not
 

1649
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,510
uh i think they're not
really it's

1650
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,520
really it's
 

1651
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,270
really it's
they're not really like a set of

1652
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:37,280
they're not really like a set of
 

1653
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,910
they're not really like a set of
criteria that you can easily match with

1654
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:39,920
criteria that you can easily match with
 

1655
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,190
criteria that you can easily match with
with the results of the

1656
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:41,200
with the results of the
 

1657
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,069
with the results of the
contest to with the results of the with

1658
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:44,079
contest to with the results of the with
 

1659
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,829
contest to with the results of the with
the submissions that are

1660
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:47,839

 

1661
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,910

made for this contest to understand if

1662
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:49,920
made for this contest to understand if
 

1663
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,589
made for this contest to understand if
they match

1664
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:51,599
they match
 

1665
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,030
they match
so it's really hard to for for them to

1666
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,040
so it's really hard to for for them to
 

1667
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,310
so it's really hard to for for them to
it's really hard to understand if they

1668
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:56,320
it's really hard to understand if they
 

1669
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,190
it's really hard to understand if they
match or not and it's really hard for us

participants if we match or not it's
 

1675
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,950
participants if we match or not it's
easy for like debuts okay yeah the bots

1676

and uh there's uh some support for uh
tip three tokens which

1682
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:12,240
tip three tokens which
 

1683
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,589
tip three tokens which
yeah we discussed and it was uh slightly

1684
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:15,599
yeah we discussed and it was uh slightly
 

1685

to make criteria more easy to understand
yeah you have actually touched two

1694
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:30,400
yeah you have actually touched two
 

1695
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,470
yeah you have actually touched two
topics here so the first one

1696
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:32,480
topics here so the first one
 

1697
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,670
topics here so the first one
so uh refers to to the judging process

1698

so uh refers to to the judging process
yeah so and that's why uh i asked

1700
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,040
yeah so and that's why uh i asked
 

1701
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,270
yeah so and that's why uh i asked
everyone to show and explain how the

1702
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:41,280
everyone to show and explain how the
 

1703
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,630
everyone to show and explain how the
solution works

1704
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:42,640
solution works
 

1705
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,150
solution works
because uh judges uh jurors

1706
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:46,160
because uh judges uh jurors
 

1707
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,589
because uh judges uh jurors
will be assessing the work

1708
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:49,599
will be assessing the work
 

1709
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,310
will be assessing the work
i hope everyone will assess personally

1710
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:52,320
i hope everyone will assess personally
 

1711
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,109
i hope everyone will assess personally
but i hope that

1712
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:53,119
but i hope that
 

1713
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,150
but i hope that
they will be assessing it fairly by by

1714
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:56,160
they will be assessing it fairly by by
 

1715
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,390
they will be assessing it fairly by by
the spirit of the contest

1716
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:58,400
the spirit of the contest
 

1717
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,349
the spirit of the contest
and the second uh topic is that uh the

1718
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:01,359
and the second uh topic is that uh the
 

1719
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,550
and the second uh topic is that uh the
contest itself

1720
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:02,560
contest itself
 

1721
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,470
contest itself
was formed uh like this because

1722
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:06,480
was formed uh like this because
 

1723
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,349
was formed uh like this because
we had several uh approaches on the

1724
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:09,359
we had several uh approaches on the
 

1725
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,270
we had several uh approaches on the
architecture and design stage

1726
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:11,280
architecture and design stage
 

1727
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,109
architecture and design stage
that were not pretty similar

1728
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:15,119
that were not pretty similar
 

1729
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,150
that were not pretty similar
uh in the implementation and

1730
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,160
uh in the implementation and
 

1731
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,550
uh in the implementation and
guys tried to to make the contest uh

1732
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:22,560
guys tried to to make the contest uh
 

1733
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,750
guys tried to to make the contest uh
in such a ways to cover all of this so

1734
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:25,760
in such a ways to cover all of this so
 

1735
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,390
in such a ways to cover all of this so
uh

1736
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:26,400
uh
 

1737
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,349
uh
maybe that causes sometimes uh some

1738
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:29,359
maybe that causes sometimes uh some
 

1739
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,310
maybe that causes sometimes uh some
blurry points

1740
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:30,320
blurry points
 

1741
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,990
blurry points
uh in in the text but uh if you have any

1742
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,000
uh in in the text but uh if you have any

judging of course in some time
 

1787
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,550
judging of course in some time
maybe it will come like best practices

1788
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:30,560
maybe it will come like best practices
 

1789
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,589
maybe it will come like best practices
whatever

believes that this or that approach
is most suitable to them but

1816

is most suitable to them but
 

1817
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,790
is most suitable to them but
this is how decentralized judging

1818
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:08,800
this is how decentralized judging
 

1819
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,670
this is how decentralized judging
works actually so we cannot impose some

1820

00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:17,440
another participant before um
 

1865
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,829
another participant before um
when it was obligatory they don't do it

1866
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:19,839
when it was obligatory they don't do it
 

1867
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:20,710
when it was obligatory they don't do it
nothing

1868
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:20,720
nothing
 

1869
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,829
nothing
now they all working but

1870
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:23,839
now they all working but
 

1871
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,990
now they all working but
working in the same way way like

1872
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:26,000
working in the same way way like
 

1873
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,190
working in the same way way like
previous

1874
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:27,200
previous
 

1875
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,230
previous
and i think if it will be possible

1876
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:30,240
and i think if it will be possible
 

1877
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,470
and i think if it will be possible
in the future to do smart contract or

1878
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:32,480
in the future to do smart contract or
 

1879
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,230
in the future to do smart contract or
maybe at least front end

1880
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:34,240
maybe at least front end
 

1881
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,990
maybe at least front end
where not possible to see marks before

1882
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,000

then you can see avoiding

1894
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:55,440
then you can see avoiding
 

1895
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,870
then you can see avoiding
all voiding of all jury participants

00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:15,119
go deeper who didn't know
 

1907
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,230

who don't know will be put up

abstain yeah blind voting yeah

1910
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:21,839
abstain yeah blind voting yeah
 

1911
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:25,190
abstain yeah blind voting yeah
so uh it's one of one of the approaches

1912
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:25,200
so uh it's one of one of the approaches
 

1913
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,550
so uh it's one of one of the approaches
uh i personally

1914
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:28,560
uh i personally
 

1915
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,190
uh i personally
think that it is just one of approaches

1916
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:31,200
think that it is just one of approaches
 

1917
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:31,589
think that it is just one of approaches
and

1918
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:31,599
and
 

1919
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,309
and
it's uh not the best one not the worst

1920
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:34,319
it's uh not the best one not the worst
 

1921
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:34,870
it's uh not the best one not the worst
one so

1922
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:34,880
one so
 

1923
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,990
one so
uh it can work and cannot so we don't we

1924
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,000
uh it can work and cannot so we don't we
 

1925
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,230
uh it can work and cannot so we don't we
won't know and unless we try

1926
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:40,240
won't know and unless we try
 

1927
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,990
won't know and unless we try
and i think the

1928
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:44,000
and i think the
 

1929
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,150
and i think the
major point here is we need to

1930
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:48,160
major point here is we need to
 

1931
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,910
major point here is we need to
grow our best jurors so and educate them

1932
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:51,920
grow our best jurors so and educate them
 

1933
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,309
grow our best jurors so and educate them
grow them motivate them to

1934
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:56,319
grow them motivate them to
 

1935
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,710
grow them motivate them to
bring the highest standards of judging

1936
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:58,720
bring the highest standards of judging
 

1937
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,510
bring the highest standards of judging
and

1938
00:43:59,510 --> 00:43:59,520
and
 

1939
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,190
and
that's the main point because you

1940
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:01,200
that's the main point because you
 

1941
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,550
that's the main point because you
remember that when

1942
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:02,560
remember that when
 

1943
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,230
remember that when
some time ago we just decided

1944
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:06,240
some time ago we just decided
 

1945
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,349
some time ago we just decided
to to pay to jurors based on the amount

1946
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:09,359
to to pay to jurors based on the amount
 

1947
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,309
to to pay to jurors based on the amount
of work they did

1948
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:10,319
of work they did
 

1949
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,910
of work they did
so on how they they voted and

1950
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:13,920
so on how they they voted and
 

1951
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,750
so on how they they voted and
some someone just voted for for one work

1952
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:17,760
some someone just voted for for one work
 

1953
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,550
some someone just voted for for one work
and

1954
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:18,560
and
 

1955
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,109
and
all others voted for all others and got

1956
00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:21,119
all others voted for all others and got
 

1957
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,109
all others voted for all others and got
the reward proportionally

1958
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:23,119
the reward proportionally
 

1959
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,270
the reward proportionally
but it helped a little

1960
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:27,280

 

1961
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,190

but at least now the jurors who

1962
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:31,200
but at least now the jurors who
 

1963
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,309
but at least now the jurors who
invest their time to assess all works

1964
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:34,319
invest their time to assess all works
 

1965
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,150
invest their time to assess all works
they feel that they're rewarded more

1966
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:36,160
they feel that they're rewarded more
 

1967
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,230
they feel that they're rewarded more
fairly but i cannot say that

1968
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:38,240

it dramatically increased the

it dramatically increased the
 

1971
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,990
it dramatically increased the
quality of judging itself uh so

i think that we can just elaborate so

i think that we can just elaborate so

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,150
so uh it doesn't seem so good right now
already

2054
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:38,160
already
 

2055
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,109
already
so and that's that's why we are working

2056
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:41,119
so and that's that's why we are working
 

2057
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,710
so and that's that's why we are working
it and

2058
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:42,720
it and
 

2059
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,910
it and
hopefully we will also

2060
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:45,920
hopefully we will also
 

2061
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,910
hopefully we will also
show it show something in coming months

2062
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:49,920
show it show something in coming months
 

2063
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,510
show it show something in coming months
but the main issue here actually there

2064
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:53,520
but the main issue here actually there
 

2065
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,870
but the main issue here actually there
is a whole set of

2066
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:54,880
is a whole set of
 

2067
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,550
is a whole set of
issues linked with atomic swaps uh so

2068
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:58,560
issues linked with atomic swaps uh so
 

2069
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,589
issues linked with atomic swaps uh so
including privacy including uh

2070
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:01,599
including privacy including uh
 

2071
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,030
including privacy including uh
how it should be implemented and uh

2072
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:05,040
how it should be implemented and uh
 

2073
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,670
how it should be implemented and uh
in both blockchains on the client side

2074
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:07,680
in both blockchains on the client side
 

2075
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,270
in both blockchains on the client side
should we use or not some

2076
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:09,280
should we use or not some
 

2077
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,550
should we use or not some
of chain server sides uh

2078
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:12,560
of chain server sides uh
 

2079
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,390
of chain server sides uh
there's uh a big bunch of questions

2080
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:16,400
there's uh a big bunch of questions
 

2081
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,430
there's uh a big bunch of questions
arising from it uh

2082
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:19,440
arising from it uh
 

2083
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,270
arising from it uh
yeah and also technologies don't stand

2084
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:21,280
yeah and also technologies don't stand
 

2085
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,589
yeah and also technologies don't stand
uh just on one

2086
00:47:23,589 --> 00:47:23,599
uh just on one
 

2087
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,430
uh just on one
one place and so they also have

2088
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:27,440

 

2089
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,710

progress and things change

2090
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:30,720
progress and things change
 

2091
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,829
progress and things change
for example uh at that time so

2092
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:33,839
for example uh at that time so
 

2093
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,870
for example uh at that time so
we were targeting uh

2094
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:36,880
we were targeting uh
 

2095
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,349
we were targeting uh
signing transactions with hardware like

2096
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:39,359
signing transactions with hardware like
 

2097
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,190
signing transactions with hardware like
ledger or trezor then remember exactly

2098
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:41,200
ledger or trezor then remember exactly
 

2099
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,069
ledger or trezor then remember exactly
which one

2100
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:42,079
which one
 

2101
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,950
which one
uh but for some reason there were some

2102
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:44,960
uh but for some reason there were some
 

2103
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,150
uh but for some reason there were some
changes so

2104
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:46,160
changes so
 

2105
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,870
changes so
that integration doesn't uh work anymore

2106
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:48,880
that integration doesn't uh work anymore
 

2107
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,950
that integration doesn't uh work anymore
so it needs to be upgraded and so on so

2108
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:50,960
so it needs to be upgraded and so on so
 

2109
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,109
so it needs to be upgraded and so on so
forth uh

2110
00:47:53,109 --> 00:47:53,119
forth uh
 

2111
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,109
forth uh
yeah so actually it's it's a good

2112
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:55,119
yeah so actually it's it's a good
 

2113
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,030
yeah so actually it's it's a good
product and i hope that we will show

2114
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:57,040
product and i hope that we will show
 

2115
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,150
product and i hope that we will show
uh some uh updated version soon

2116
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:00,160
uh some uh updated version soon
 

2117
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,510
uh some uh updated version soon
uh from outside the place

2118
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:03,520
uh from outside the place
 

2119
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,990
uh from outside the place
uh but it's not the breach itself so

2120
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:06,000
uh but it's not the breach itself so
 

2121
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,349
uh but it's not the breach itself so
it's is this these are different

2122
00:48:07,349 --> 00:48:07,359
it's is this these are different
 

2123
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:08,230
it's is this these are different
technologies

2124
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:08,240
technologies
 

2125
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,870
technologies
yes alex please

2126
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:12,880

 

2127
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,750

you you say that you talk with your guys

2128
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:15,760
you you say that you talk with your guys
 

2129
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,069

and

2130
00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:16,079
and
 

2131
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,309
and
they told you that this solution is not

2132
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:18,319
they told you that this solution is not
 

2133
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,109
they told you that this solution is not
very good could you verify more on this

2134
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:21,119
very good could you verify more on this
 

2135
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,950
very good could you verify more on this
piece

2136
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:22,960
piece
 

2137
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,430
piece
i don't remember all exact technical

2138
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:25,440
i don't remember all exact technical
 

2139
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,630
i don't remember all exact technical
stuff that they said

2140
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:26,640
stuff that they said
 

2141
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,030
stuff that they said
so if you want i just will collect some

in details uh
 

2149
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,790
in details uh
what was going on there because they

2150
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:36,800
what was going on there because they
 

2151
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,349
what was going on there because they
changed

2152
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:37,359
changed
 

2153
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:41,109
changed
i think uh three or four frameworks uh

2154
00:48:41,109 --> 00:48:41,119
i think uh three or four frameworks uh
 

2155
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,349
i think uh three or four frameworks uh
to optimize the work of this atomic swap

2156
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:43,359
to optimize the work of this atomic swap
 

2157
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:44,230
to optimize the work of this atomic swap
solution

2158
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:44,240
solution
 

2159
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,790
solution
so it's it was not an easy game at all

2160
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:46,800
so it's it was not an easy game at all
 

2161
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,990
so it's it was not an easy game at all
so uh

2162
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,000
so uh
 

2163
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,190
so uh
that's why yeah i discussed with them

2164
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:51,200
that's why yeah i discussed with them
 

2165
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,470
that's why yeah i discussed with them
please it would be very available yeah

2166

00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:56,640
sure sure i will just make a note for
 

2169
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,470
sure sure i will just make a note for
myself

2170
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:58,480
myself
 

2171
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,750
myself
what i uh i mean about bridge with

2172
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:01,760
what i uh i mean about bridge with
 

2173
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,549
what i uh i mean about bridge with
bitcoin

2174
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:02,559
bitcoin
 

2175
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,230
bitcoin
it's not the same that bridge with

2176
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:04,240
it's not the same that bridge with
 

2177
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,309
it's not the same that bridge with
ethereum yes absolutely not

2178
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:06,319
ethereum yes absolutely not
 

2179
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,430
ethereum yes absolutely not
not totally the bridge and yeah

2180
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:09,440
not totally the bridge and yeah
 

2181
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,750
not totally the bridge and yeah
it's more close to atomic swap not

2182
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:13,760
it's more close to atomic swap not
 

2183
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,790
it's more close to atomic swap not
uh the main issue here is that

2184
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:16,800
uh the main issue here is that
 

2185
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,109
uh the main issue here is that
bitcoin doesn't work like uh like

2186
00:49:19,109 --> 00:49:19,119
bitcoin doesn't work like uh like
 

2187
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:19,829
bitcoin doesn't work like uh like
ethereum

2188
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:19,839
ethereum
 

2189
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,430

they are absolutely two absolutely

2190
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:21,440
they are absolutely two absolutely
 

2191
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,510
they are absolutely two absolutely
different things in terms of

2192
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:23,520
different things in terms of
 

2193
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,150
different things in terms of
uh so-called smart contracts there is no

2194
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:26,160
uh so-called smart contracts there is no
 

2195
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,589
uh so-called smart contracts there is no
smart contracts in bitcoin there are

2196
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:27,599
smart contracts in bitcoin there are
 

2197
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,230
smart contracts in bitcoin there are
scripts

2198
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:28,240
scripts
 

2199
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,069

guy
uh to discuss about scripting in bitcoin

2204

uh to discuss about scripting in bitcoin
 

2205
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:35,829
uh to discuss about scripting in bitcoin
but

2206
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:35,839
but
 

2207
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,150
but
i remember something from my tech guys

2208
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:38,160
i remember something from my tech guys
 

2209
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,670
i remember something from my tech guys
uh were saying

2210
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:39,680
uh were saying
 

2211
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,790
uh were saying
and uh it's always a nightmare to write

2212
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:42,800
and uh it's always a nightmare to write
 

2213
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,309
and uh it's always a nightmare to write
scripts in bitcoin

2214
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:44,319
scripts in bitcoin
 

2215
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,589
scripts in bitcoin
and i remember that

2216
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:47,599
and i remember that
 

2217
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,030
and i remember that
for atomic swap uh

2218
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,040
for atomic swap uh
 

2219
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,150
for atomic swap uh
it's htlc contracts and for the bridge

2220
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:54,160
it's htlc contracts and for the bridge
 

2221
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,270
it's htlc contracts and for the bridge
there should be htlc not contraband hdlc

2222
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:57,280
there should be htlc not contraband hdlc
 

2223
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,390
there should be htlc not contraband hdlc

another approach which one i don't know

2230
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:05,200
another approach which one i don't know
 

2231
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,630
another approach which one i don't know
because we don't have the architecture

2232
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:06,640
because we don't have the architecture
 

2233
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,390
because we don't have the architecture
and design context we get

2234
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:08,400
and design context we get
 

2235
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,750
and design context we get
so that's why we want to launch it

2236
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:11,760
so that's why we want to launch it
 

2237
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,030
so that's why we want to launch it
good idea in this case good idea

2238
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:15,040
good idea in this case good idea
 

2239
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,950
good idea in this case good idea

yes please all right the problem is like

2244
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:27,200
yes please all right the problem is like
 

2245
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,030
yes please all right the problem is like
um the implement it's actually like

2246
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:31,040
um the implement it's actually like
 

2247
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,309
um the implement it's actually like
um it comes down to the

2248
00:50:34,309 --> 00:50:34,319
um it comes down to the
 

2249
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,670
um it comes down to the
very simple question how do you

very simple question how do you
 

2251
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,910
very simple question how do you
implement like escrow on bitcoin

2252
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:37,920
implement like escrow on bitcoin
 

2253
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,109

even know if we need
 

2269
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,630
even know if we need
well we do need a design stage

2270
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:00,640
well we do need a design stage
 

2271
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,150
well we do need a design stage
