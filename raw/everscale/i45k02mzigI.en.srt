wanted to implement skates make courses

2326
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:30,480
wanted to implement skates make courses
 

2327
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,190

and so on that's why a lot of work to do

2328
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:33,200
and so on that's why a lot of work to do
 

2329
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,750
and so on that's why a lot of work to do
but finally i think it will be

2330
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:35,760
but finally i think it will be
 

2331
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,430
but finally i think it will be
good for our scale

2332
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:37,440
good for our scale
 

2333
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,990

and uh that would be one source of
 

2397
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,390
and uh that would be one source of
revenue the other one would be uh

uh for example by defy alliance that

2406
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:09,200
uh for example by defy alliance that
 

2407

there is a demand for such and such
 

2409
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,750
there is a demand for such and such
course and then we implement it with a

2410
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:13,760
course and then we implement it with a
 

2411
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,109
course and then we implement it with a
corresponding

2582
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:30,640
something like that like um
 

2583
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,470
something like that like um
is is the technology that are are you

2584
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:32,480
is is the technology that are are you
 

2585
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,390
is is the technology that are are you
able to do that now are we are we

2586
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:34,400
able to do that now are we are we
 

2587
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,790
able to do that now are we are we
capable of doing that i i have i've i i

2588
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:36,800
capable of doing that i i have i've i i
 

2589

2595
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,030
fan of this my question is do we have
the ability to do it now

2596
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:47,040
the ability to do it now
 

2597
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,549
the ability to do it now
yes if we assume that a multi-sig

2598
00:53:50,549 --> 00:53:50,559
yes if we assume that a multi-sig
 

2599

you know decision makers
is available uh that's really what is

2604
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:57,520
is available uh that's really what is
 

2605
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,190
is available uh that's really what is
needed um

2606
00:53:59,190 --> 00:53:59,200
needed um
 

2607
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,309
needed um
because in any case all of this

is directly control should be directly
 

2611
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,190
is directly control should be directly
controlled by the foundation right

2612
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:07,200
controlled by the foundation right

00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,670
they would like to see right basics
taking for example maybe the safest one

2624
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:19,680
taking for example maybe the safest one
 

2625
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,990
taking for example maybe the safest one
or whatever else they might come up with

2626

the academy one of the things we would

2644
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:42,319
the academy one of the things we would
 

2645
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:43,589
the academy one of the things we would
love to do

2646
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:43,599
love to do
 

2647
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,190
love to do
is to actually bring in a couple of

2648
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:45,200
is to actually bring in a couple of
 

2649
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,630
is to actually bring in a couple of
professionals

2650
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:46,640
professionals
 

2651
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,789
professionals
uh maybe and those people will need a

2652
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:48,799
uh maybe and those people will need a
 

2653
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:52,630
uh maybe and those people will need a
salary so if we are able from from the

2654
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:52,640
salary so if we are able from from the
 

2655
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,470
salary so if we are able from from the
cream from the cream

2656
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:54,480
cream from the cream
 

2657
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,109
cream from the cream
of course of course so to answer your

2658
00:54:57,109 --> 00:54:57,119
of course of course so to answer your
 

2659
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,109
of course of course so to answer your
question about the amount i think we

2660
00:54:59,109 --> 00:54:59,119
question about the amount i think we
 

2661
00:54:59,119 --> 00:54:59,990
question about the amount i think we
should go

2662
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:00,000
should go
 

2663
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,309
should go
in in the reverse

2664
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:02,319
in in the reverse
 

2665
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:03,910
in in the reverse
we should first estimate what the

2666
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:03,920
we should first estimate what the
 

2667
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,710
we should first estimate what the
reasonable expenses for like really

2668
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:06,720
reasonable expenses for like really
 

2669
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,230
reasonable expenses for like really
really useful uh team would be

2670
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:10,240
really useful uh team would be
 

2671
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,870
really useful uh team would be
and then simply say okay if we invested

2672
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:12,880
and then simply say okay if we invested
 

2673
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,789
and then simply say okay if we invested
five percent per annum

2674
00:55:14,789 --> 00:55:14,799
five percent per annum
 

2675
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,589
five percent per annum
uh what should be the principal amount

2676
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:17,599
uh what should be the principal amount
 

2677
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,309
uh what should be the principal amount
very simple so uh i'm sure a foundation

2678
00:55:20,309 --> 00:55:20,319
very simple so uh i'm sure a foundation
 

2679
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,910
very simple so uh i'm sure a foundation
can certainly do that but the concept

2680
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:23,920
can certainly do that but the concept
 

2681
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,430
can certainly do that but the concept
is not that we're asking for a

2682
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:25,440
is not that we're asking for a
 

2683
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,670
is not that we're asking for a
particular amount

2684
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:27,680
particular amount
 

2685
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,870
particular amount
uh the concept is that we are asking for

2686
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:30,880
uh the concept is that we are asking for
 

2687
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,270
uh the concept is that we are asking for
the principle to be introduced that some

2688
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:33,280
the principle to be introduced that some
 

2689
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,430
the principle to be introduced that some
amount is invested and the cream as

2690
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:35,440
amount is invested and the cream as

i can absolutely see this working in the
on-chain world at least i hope to see it

2726
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:13,040
on-chain world at least i hope to see it
 

2727
