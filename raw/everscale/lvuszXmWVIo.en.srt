um actually with cadastral we we'll come
 

1123
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:14,950
um actually with cadastral we we'll come
to it

1124
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:14,960
to it
 

1125
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,230
to it
uh but first like um uh like as we

1126
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,240
uh but first like um uh like as we
 

1127
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,669
uh but first like um uh like as we
mentioned that

1128
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:19,679
mentioned that
 

1129
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,990
mentioned that
our game uh

1130
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,000
our game uh
 

1131
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,549
our game uh
takes place in uh in the near future

1132
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:24,559
takes place in uh in the near future
 

1133
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,029
takes place in uh in the near future
uh but in fact bali has

1134
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:27,039
uh but in fact bali has
 

1135
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,669
uh but in fact bali has
a lots of mysteries in the presence like

1136
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:29,679
a lots of mysteries in the presence like
 

1137
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,110
a lots of mysteries in the presence like
being just one

1138
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,120
being just one
 

1139
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,029
being just one
rather small piece of land

1140
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:33,039
rather small piece of land
 

1141
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,990
rather small piece of land
uh one of the southlands of indonesia's

1142
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,000
uh one of the southlands of indonesia's
 

1143
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,710
uh one of the southlands of indonesia's
island bali is a real magnet for people

1144
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:38,720
island bali is a real magnet for people
 

1145
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,549
island bali is a real magnet for people
from all over the globe

1146
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:40,559
from all over the globe
 

1147
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,750
from all over the globe
and this only this is is a purposeful

1148
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:43,760
and this only this is is a purposeful
 

1149
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,710
and this only this is is a purposeful
study actually a reason to to know it

1150
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:46,720
study actually a reason to to know it
 

1151
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,669
study actually a reason to to know it
better

1152
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:47,679
better
 

1153
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,590
better
um and

1154
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:49,600
um and
 

1155
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,470
um and
so

1156
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,480
so
 

1157
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,430
so
that's what we did probably uh we did

1158
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:53,440
that's what we did probably uh we did
 

1159
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,390
that's what we did probably uh we did
like an extensive uh mapping exercise to

1160
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,400
like an extensive uh mapping exercise to
 

1161
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,230
like an extensive uh mapping exercise to
understand the island

1162
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,240
understand the island
 

1163
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,750
understand the island
we looked at demography at settlements

1164
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:01,760
we looked at demography at settlements
 

1165
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,230
we looked at demography at settlements
of density at

1166
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,240
of density at
 

1167
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,990
of density at
natural layers

1168
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,000
natural layers
 

1169
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,110
natural layers
water

1170
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,120
water
 

1171
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,990
water
supply that's all the things that get us

1172
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,000
supply that's all the things that get us
 

1173
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,909
supply that's all the things that get us
familiar with the islands uh with the

1174
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:11,919
familiar with the islands uh with the
 

1175
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,990
familiar with the islands uh with the
territory we work with

1176
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,000
territory we work with
 

1177
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,269
territory we work with
and uh so that helped us build a

1178
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:17,279
and uh so that helped us build a
 

1179
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,870
and uh so that helped us build a
methodology

1180
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:18,880
methodology
 

1181
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,430
methodology
for our work um in foreseeing uh future

1182
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:23,440
for our work um in foreseeing uh future
 

1183
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,470
for our work um in foreseeing uh future
development of the island so um

1184
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:26,480
development of the island so um
 

1185
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,230
development of the island so um
we uh kind of take existing situation

1186
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:30,240
we uh kind of take existing situation
 

1187
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,630
we uh kind of take existing situation
uh we survey it create a full digital

1188
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:32,640
uh we survey it create a full digital
 

1189
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,070
uh we survey it create a full digital
copy of the islands uh then we come up

1190
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,080
copy of the islands uh then we come up
 

1191
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,470
copy of the islands uh then we come up
with a like a set of rules and

1192
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,480
with a like a set of rules and
 

1193
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,110
with a like a set of rules and
guidelines that really slash our vision

1194
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,120
guidelines that really slash our vision
 

1195
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,390
guidelines that really slash our vision
of

1196
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:42,400
of
 

1197
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,630
of
future uh development

1198
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:44,640
future uh development
 

1199
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,269
future uh development
and then since we have a metaverse we

1200
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:47,279
and then since we have a metaverse we
 

1201
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,710
and then since we have a metaverse we
can uh

1202
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
can uh
 

1203
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,110
can uh
we can um

1204
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,120
we can um
 

1205
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,029
we can um
to test this hypothesis and uh if if if

1206
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:55,039
to test this hypothesis and uh if if if
 

1207
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,789
to test this hypothesis and uh if if if
some of these

1208
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:56,799
some of these
 

1209
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,950
some of these
regulations prove useful

1210
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:58,960
regulations prove useful
 

1211
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,110
regulations prove useful
um this could be

1212
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,120
um this could be
 

1213
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,310
um this could be
a real regulation that can be used by uh

1214
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,320
a real regulation that can be used by uh
 

1215
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,029
a real regulation that can be used by uh
urban planning uh um

1216

um
 

1227
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,990
um
a paradigm that we uh we think then uh

1228
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,000
a paradigm that we uh we think then uh
 

1229
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,190

the uh uh deurbanization trend when uh
 

1247
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,269
the uh uh deurbanization trend when uh
like in the near future people will be

00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:43,279
like in the near future people will be
 

1249
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,430

00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,120
and uh and bali is a very good uh
 

1265
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,909
and uh and bali is a very good uh
a very good case to study uh this trend

1266
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:07,919
a very good case to study uh this trend
 

1267
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,870
a very good case to study uh this trend
because bali has never been uh much uh

1268
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:10,880
because bali has never been uh much uh

is also somewhere in the jungle but we
 

1277
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,950
is also somewhere in the jungle but we
do not feel um anywhere remote because
