five proposals that we put up on the um
whenever dao uh just again it was just
recently and we might want to take the
folks together with the
triceraton as well through those five
proposals and then check the questions
because i'm sure there'll be a lot of
questions related to that
and then of course we can follow up with
the questions that were sent prior to
those proposals
yes sounds good
so guys are you ready sergey
shashovinski
yes
yes we are ready we have
had experienced some connection
connection issues but right now we are
good
hey guys
excellent
nice okay so
have everybody and so shall we continue
moving
on yeah you want me to start i can give
a little bit of level for the ground and
then again we'll go through the five
proposals
that the um you know that we've been
contemplating on with the
with the defy lines members with the
broke system and some of the other folks
from the network were engaged into those
discussions as well but again it's it's
only it's now open for feedback from the
wider community and it's put
for the vote on evernote as a conceptual
framework and then each of the five
pieces will be put for the vote
individually with more details and more
meat on there
okay so
the kind of the philosophical part is
that as well remember two years ago we
launched with a very experimental
innovative model
which assumed kind of ultimate
decentralization
where everybody could put up a proposal
for a contest or a partnership and it
was voted and executed and it of course
sounded great in theory but in practice
what we got is that
there were a lot of teams that were
basically
let's say hunting for tokens rather than
really looking forward to the
contribution so a lot of contests and
partnerships basically became uh again a
hunt for for tokens with no
obvious value to the network
at some point on parallel there have
been people who were buying tokens
investing you know into the tokens and
at some point they were getting
frustrated with that the teams were
getting tokens for no no obvious
value-add
we're eventually kind of dumping them on
the market and then we saw continuous
decrease on the price
so at that point in time about a year
ago there was an initiative from
the other gentleman on the call
sir again sergey and then of course the
other team members of the defined lines
that the fire line should be created to
essentially represent the interest of
the investors
and that's how the initiative came
through and
the fire alliance got the location of
tokens and we saw some some good results
coming in we saw inflow of liquidity we
saw a number of great listings you know
and some of the other notable listings
as well as some of the other initiatives
like ever dao like uh
like our start you know uh that moved
the network forward however you know it
wasn't it wasn't enough eventually
that injection of reforms was not enough
to
move the network yet to another level of
valuation where we all think it deserves
to be essentially the top hundred
so basically acknowledging that and it
was became even more dramatic in the
current bear market we came up with
coming up with five proposals on how to
incentivize and push the network even
further
and we're going to go
one by one through them now
and looking forward to feedback on that
the first one is
i know you guys
anybody wants to take the first one the
initial partners um ornish members or
otherwise i can take it
i think one of the staircases because
the level idea came from
from from you guys you might want to
take the level one
yes yes i had proposed uh levers idea it
wasn't during my session some weeks ago
and um there was kind of they were this
kind of idea uh we have a lot of
obligations uh
uh during uh
uh ever downwards uh partners uh
like partners and initial
and uh endeavors
decided to continue with partners and uh
continue to work with initials
but
it's not easy
move instructions now and
it's not easy to set up good wasting
programs because
a lot of a lot of people send
and
one of the options how to do it
uh it's level
uh
all initials and partners will get
levers
as soon as possible
and
it's looks diverse they will not be able
to sell it on exchange
but they can use it for different for
different uh
economic saturation operation now uh
where we have levers it's value and if
we will wait
for two years uh we will be able
uh convert these levers to two levels
uh if we want to translate these letters
to another
partners or two developing stream
uh we're able to do it now
and uh
it's like once from from real world and
and we want to describe it's uh
more
and uh
pushed to ever dao
and we had calculate
all obligations we have now
it's less than
50 50 million
and we will have some rest uh for
starting different programs with
influencer
and influencers will not be able to sell
it and create any pressure to market
and uh it will work with a different
influence of who ready to work uh
with a long-term motivation program
it's uh it's about levers uh we will
describe it more clearly
like
another for reforms what we
proposed
might be difficult for the folks to to
catch it kind of but uh the text is also
up on the screen but basically the idea
is to strike the tangible balance
between
uh
rewarding the teams for previous
contributions essentially uh with the
wasting that they deserve
yet not creating the pressure on the
market
um maybe a shorter mark for me is the
idea that the levers would be
would be would be tradable through otc
so folks could sell them although of
course there could potentially be
discounts uh discounts on that level
because what you see market you know
it's it's a supply and demand kind of
market
uh but those those levers would also
have some liquid so
i know sergey the other surgery do you
want to mention anything
i can add there that there is no
restrictions
to put the
best levers into players on flat cube or
desado or other
taxes
so
it can be
traded freely
[Music]
can't be done from day one or later one
when the market
understand the player price of these
tokens
exactly i think it's a very elegant idea
so and let's elaborate on that in the
coming days
moving on um there are
um there are two big kind of wasting
obligations one is that it was in the
original declaration of decentralization
uh towards dunlaps which is now everex
170 million tokens and then the defy
line says we'll remember
also 170 million and there is an elegant
idea i know sergey do you want to do you
want to take that one
thank you yes
yes sure
i'd love to take that one
initially uh on one hand uh we've been
constantly asked by
potential investors in the everscale
ecosystem about the motivation of uh
core contributors
and on the other hand uh we hear
from them that the
issuance of tokens uncontrolled issues
of tokens uh could affect the price
significant things
and it's not a good time right now to
issue any tokens
so
we
thought
several months about that how to tackle
this problem
and
found
elegant idea
in our view that links the pasting of
tokens that are
that should be bested to
both everex and
the file alliance
link this investing to
our place
in ranking of
key aggregators like cmc uh coin market
cap or coin
right now in our view when gecko
tracks better the ratings
of uh several blockchains
and uh we think that will be fair both
for investors and for core contributors
and will support motivation
poor contributors
and will help them develop every system
further
if
this testing will be directly linked
mostly gradually
to the place in uh
going decor rating for example and it
means that uh
we we should not only
enter the top 100 place
of this rating
we would also have to be there for a
particular amount of time
uh once uh the call proposal will be
approved by tawa uh we will formulate
the exact figures and timing uh
for that formula and hope that dao will
support
this
definitive formula as well
just couple just a couple of thoughts
from me on this one so the idea is that
instead of automatically getting the
westerns that's talking about evrx or
defy alliance continue to get uh to get
tokens against cd5 lines programs
that the new tokens would be vested
only upon entry in top 100 and then
advancing towards top 10 gradually
and basically what it means is that the
whole
all the teams in the alliance and everex
would be sitting in one boat and rowing
in the same direction uh you know
towards the top country uh which which
also
it's it's important to understand that
if and when and i personally have no
doubts that we enter top 100 and advance
in the ranking it obviously means that
there will be much higher trading
volumes so there would be more liquidity
in the market and once tokens those
tokens would be vested they would could
not put
basically a lot of pressure on the
market because again we would be facing
total different levels of trading
volumes
so that's two cents for me i know if
sergey or pablo if you guys want to add
anything to this
yeah yeah what's your example yeah from
us from my point of view it's uh
it's
one of the best solution current
situation uh first of all we will be
together allianz and the verified one
boat
and uh
on the in this
journey team we can achieve our goals
from top 100 up to top 10
and
we will work hardly
everyx will
develop a protocol we will build
different different products on top of
this protocol and attract more
infidelity to different products
because
it's just one of the problems because we
can't we can't launch some kind of
product what we
what we can develop
we have different partners but we can
launch it now
and
but in protocol before
technical characteristics
what we estimate from from protocol it
will be achievable and
we will we will get returns from our
work together it's very important thing
absolutely
cool all right i think now we
now folks hopefully grabs grasp this
this idea of one boat
rolling towards the you know the
capitalization
sergey wanted to add something or we'll
move on
no no
okay
so the next one is core development i
know it's late for privilege you want to
check that one pavel or you want me to
take it i can check it as well
uh no problem alexander i will take it
uh actually
i already
don't know when can i switch light on
here oh
okay so i'm in the car sorry
for that we have quite quite late here
so uh i already
had a on the previous day uh
um
described what's going on in their eggs
uh so the the cage the main changes uh
related to the fact that it was it was
not possible for a single person even so
pretty
to handle all
roles
because that's 24 hours a day anyway uh
so media focused on um gosh project
uh which is long-term uh
i think very beneficial to every scale
network
but
everex has a focus on
core products which
so those products they led by uh
actually team leads and they think
they're very senior they there was a
uh they were they may they made
a session
just hour
before this
uh they
used
absolutely
[Music]
maybe turn your video off and just
repeat the last thing you said
each
direction for each
each team
is self-sufficient uh so they
have their own roadmap their own plans
those uh plans they are coming to
driven so
uh
for
the
evernote we have uh
architectural committee where k members
of the network of accommodation system
they
uh discuss business priorities and uh
well now the process is already
established and uh not team
following business priorities as sergey
actually said
sdk or evernote platform
they have
also some tools to
get uh
get feedback from
the community and
develop it in a way that
beneficial for everyone
so we don't see any
uh
blockers
for that approach
if there are some questions between
teams which require some
coordination
then team leader team leads uh have a
meeting and in some rare cases they ask
some other
members of rx to support to resolve some
conflicting resources but that
approach works well we see the results
we see
releases which going on
and
if you have any questions on that please
ask
just a couple of just a couple of senses
also on this thanks pablo so basically
um this whole thing already started as
paul mentioned starting from july
from now
core development will be covered by
their scale foundation and new companies
will be able to also participate
in core development so it's not just
never ex you know pushing the network
forward on the core
uh and we know there are teams on the
network who can actually do that
and of course as because the financing
would come from the foundation
uh it will have to be strictly open
source
and proactively you know and properly
deployed also
so those are small conditions for me
anything
it's too
important kind of firm because
previous two years
we
didn't didn't see a last version of
product in source
and some time we did some duplicated
working process
and
a lot of a lot of teams uh asks
ask averix and us
to create a more open source more open
source
products uh because we're able to
participate in it and we have uh
near 10 people it's uh very powerful
engineers inside our network
and uh
maybe some some of them will join to
poor development because for development
it's uh it's a main resource of network
and uh
i think we will grow twice maybe more in
two months
uh
because we'll become open source and
we will contribute to from roxas and
from independent developers
and it's important that in crypto window
uh every skill foundation will support
all of all people who can contribute
to core development
it's uh it will protect our network from
uh any intervention
great point certainly all right moving
on
the next one is grants and partnerships
um
basically i mean it's kind of
towards the same idea as we discussed in
the first point the idea basically the
fundamental idea behind this proposal is
to reward only for
a
contribution that that actually that is
proven and that
that this can be seen by everybody on
the network
and here it's the same idea
that uh that grants or any other forms
of rewards
would be only executed after the
contribution physically happens so we
don't have situations that teams receive
grants or any other form again of reward
and and then for whatever reason maybe
simply because they just couldn't
execute or the idea was
did not find a product market fit or
whatever else
and the contribution physically did not
happen well those tokens would again hit
the market
so
this is a very simple idea and the
spin-off on this idea is that the grants
would come actually in dollars not in
northern tokens so that a it's easier
for the team to
cover its expenses it's it's not
volatile as some of the tokens uh
including of course ever
and also again if uh
to eliminate cases of uh
cases of uh
tokens hit in the market so again the
idea is to
improve the supply demand on the market
comments sergey for another surgery
all comments for the hours
yeah and it will be financed from the by
the crystal hands program which was
presented by the detailed alliance
that would be the source of funding for
this one
and then last but not least as we
discussed what we discussed now for a
year or more now
is there is our continuous ideas to
eliminate
issuance uh during the validation
so there is now a simple idea finally to
allocate 200 million tokens to validate
our subsidy fund and stop the issuance
of new tokens and what it basically
means is that
would be compensated from that fund uh
for their work it would be enough for a
large amount of years given that we only
spent 60 millions in the last couple of
years
on during network existence on
validation and even if there is some
sort of you know acceleration uh we
have enough enough tokens for quite a
while
and um
that will make investors very happy uh
those investors who were concerned that
continuous emission dilutes their you
know essentially they're holding in the
network so it's a very simple idea
comments folks
uh yeah
uh about one years ago i
say that uh
we have a minor emission network and
it's uh doesn't matter
uh because it's not big amount of tokens
if you will compare it without treasury
but a lot of investors told to us again
in the game that uh emission uh it's uh
it's a big thought it's a big topic and
uh if you have a lot of tokens of
surgery the right way uses tokens
uh especially it was from some asian
investors
because in their mind if i joined the
project
they do it for five and ten years and uh
from from their perspective
uh emissions is a big problem
and this is why i changed my mind and
now i'm strong support to stop a mission
and i use
tokens from givers
for a different kind of
compensate for for validators
injured and yet
so and again summarizing those five
proposals that were again just put on
every dollar so you can find a rhythm
there uh
the idea is really to start rewarding
for contribution uh only no not not not
against the promises or some
hypothetical contribution from the past
that might not have necessarily
materialized
and uh this way to rebalance
fundamentally supply demand situation
and push the network forward on
uh in capitalization without any
manipulations all of those initiatives
has fundamental nature uh versus you
know any speculative nature so we think
this is these are very robust proposals
all right i'll um
i'll stop sharing my screen and happy to
take comments questions
yeah i i i want to see something about
it yeah
uh
after voting for this proposal if ever
that will support it
uh we will uh push five five ships of
the proposal
for all reforms
uh we
and
we are working here with different asian
financial groups different investors
uh to bring new partners new project and
univision to our network
asian blockchain
and uh all our location he is here with
vi and sergey in singapore now while
bali
and so i think it's right next to
us yep a couple of words from my side uh
i think that
uh all these five reforms uh will bring
more clarity to
investors uh on how
our treasury should be spent
and
what are the motivation programs for
different participants of the ecosystem
for validators
they receive tokens from treasury not on
top of the
total supply
for everex for file and for other
initial members
and in my view the
current timing is
so important for investors so that
we
limit significantly uncontrolled issues
of tokens
and provide motivation in the same time
so
this
in my view this proposal could solve
both problems with one shot
are will any closing remarks as you move
inside
or we move to questions
from joanne
let's go to questions i think we said
enough
i'm not talking enough
do you have anything on your end or
or shall we start taking community
questions please feel free to moderate
from here yes let's move on to the
questions i think they're still being a
bit organized so
uh let's see how it turns out um
kicking it off with the first one we
have during the recent maynet stress
test
short time tps drops were observed at
the moments of local load peaks was it
due to the test configuration or
this is caused by the current design
if due to the current design what is the
reason um
and
load rebalancing question mark
uh yeah yeah about this test uh
we did it
by biogym because
because we need to understand real
situation and
and how it's work not in test net how
it's working mainnet
because uh it's impossible to be solid
with any negotiations with big partners
uh if you're not sure
so this is why we launched with stress
test
about about results
uh stress test was uh near our internal
estimation
uh how how it will be working reality
and uh okay in one chain we achieved uh
uh 4 000 tps um maybe we can achieve
more
but uh we want to test it with ram
uh because because because of a ramp
we can change our test design and work
more with different external messages
and
the next step of our ramp when we will
get
a different for chain inside
uh we will we will continue our stress
tests uh because uh this swiss test is a
good proof for our partners that our
network is real speed and real scalable
uh
the main problem of in the during this
stress test was different dubs
uh we saw a lot of problems with
flood cube and bridge
because our internal architecture
didn't support some things and now we
are fixing it
because because we want to
uh to work with uh british cube
in new speeds what we can achieve in
every skill
great
uh and good point too
okay thank you
there are currently about 200 validators
in the network the magister ludi program
will end soon how global governments
plans governance plans to support and
expand the decentral decentralization of
the network
this question came up
about
half an hour ago
this is the i think it's important
question and
thank you for it
uh
actually we have technically we have uh
half a year to go for magistrate
rewards
if we talk about locks stakes
we still have pending
rust cup rewards distribution there was
actually a good reason for not
distributing it
more than half a year ago
unfortunately
we didn't expect that some development
will take
that long and at the moment
i personally think that that was mistake
to
prolong and to postpone distribution of
rewards but what is done cannot be
undone
so we are now in a position when uh
actually
we have that obligation to distribute
rewards
we will try to
follow the initial spirit of
reward structure
at the same time i guess validators
understand that we are now a little bit
in a different
reality taking into account
what happened
there are some
by by the way there are some proposals
from validators how to mitigate that uh
issue we created
by our hands
uh
so
just remind uh the main reason was that
we would like to
have a new version of say electric pool
pair
which will be compatible with all
protocol changes which we plan to do
uh in the nearest term so if we
uh
so
we um
and since now we uh will let us wait so
long
uh we would like to finish it finally
and
uh
the rust cup rewards distribution will
add up three hundred
potentially hope that they are still
people who are motivated to participate
validation so 300
more validators
in that respect that is the answer so
once we will finally distribute rewards
for rust cup then
there will be
support
governance support
for decentralization
great great answer i hope that clears up
everything you're
wondering uh
according to the white paper emission of
ever should be stopped will this point
be completed how and when
we just call that's exactly what sergey
told point number five
uh bitcoin bridge scheduled for q4 2022
is everything going according to plan
i think we've also covered this uh in
the past call but if anybody wants to
dive deeper into it will be integrated
into octaves bridge and
will it be a separate solution like ada
ever
yeah
which isn't we didn't decide yet how it
will work
uh because uh it's depends from the epd
providers
i
i think it will be closer to other
because it's it's impossible to support
uh full bridge architecture with bitcoin
because we need a
mirror smart contract system
and uh for bitcoin it will be
large
and uh
and very hard to
and very hard to test it and uh and
protect if you had
if you had to be contracts inside
bitcoin
okay
uh moving on does everex have a pr
agency that helps to develop brand
positioning of everex labs uh does it
endure to everex teams who are
developing different products
i can
partly answer that everex doesn't work
with a pr agency any longer
we tend to collaborate internally but
when it comes to projects and
products it also depends on each team
lead now
so if they work with uh they can work
with our resources um or they can also
contract their own and sometimes everex
also works with the defy alliance if
it's something that is directly
beneficial for the everscale network
and maybe alex wants to add anything
onto that
yeah i mean it was important to have the
agency for the rebranding of the of the
network
and the labs mostly network of course
because it was a comprehensive ecosystem
rebranding so my personal opinion is
that this is one thing that we did well
i think uh ever prefix kind of took over
what was happening before with stone so
we know however those ever starts ever
whatever
and i think ever is a great marketing
tool as well the word itself and
obviously the scale
uh the scalability so i think on the
rebranding side actually we did quite
well
and the agency played it all
so i can see finally in the community
one question one comment related to what
we presented uh with the five proposals
somebody is saying that we should how
about stopping the mission at 2.1
billion everest precisely so one chance
of bitcoin um yeah that's to smile that
would be symbolic maybe
but on a serious note are there any
questions because i can see on what we
proposed because those are quite
significant uh either
people did not have time to
to read or digest what we presented
but i don't see like more questions i
think that's the case because it just
went up onto everdao so people are
probably reading it internalizing and
we'll come back with lots of questions
in the chat so
yeah
nothing else has come over on this side
that was the last question about
stopping a mission at 2.1 billion
[Music]
uh yeah there's a few questions in the
chat that i already uh sent to the john
uh
but the most questions are related in
general to the
uh everscale uh
development
not on for the proposal because the
proposal just been
published
[Music]
no more one hour ago yeah and community
need to
to deep understand it yeah
so a little smart to keep the image
session short put the proposal up just
two minutes before
there would be no questions
of course joking maybe we'll have
another call uh thursday or friday
seeing how the community
if if anybody has anything big that they
need to ask there's a lot of questions
coming through we could just do another
ama
in my view
voting could show
whether a community has a lot of
questions or not
for this proposal
they'd have a lot of questions before
they knew how to vote
if they were on the fence with anything
yeah
i think my personal opinion is those are
quite very elegant proposals
and tempting proposals uh so it's it's
uh
i would actually love to see the
uh small investors or small token
holders voting first
uh to see like the real distribution of
the real level of agreement and support
for this before you know the large token
holder step in into the boat
interesting to see that
all right shall we give it like one more
minute and if there are no questions
[Music]
then we
will just check them in the everscale
community chat
yep nothing else coming through maybe on
youtube roman do you see anything on
youtube
uh on the youtube
i see only one question regarding
uh
regarding the ram ram protocol
integration and when will be done
yes uh thank you for that question
ramp is very important upgrade
uh we mentioned that many times
it is in tests uh
for
several months
i think at least two months uh but
it is since it's quite significant
upgrade
uh
there are still some
um discrepancies which happen
in order to
finally
cut the style
we decided to open source it this week
i'm i i hope that it will be fully
functional and you'll be able to
launch network with
ramp and to test on it uh anyway if if
there will be some still some bucks uh
it will be that test and bug fixing will
should be finished uh in open in fully
transparent and open way
okay great i think that concludes our
ama with the team leads um so for
community if you do have any remaining
questions you can always ask it in the
chat
and we will get back to you
cool thank you everybody thank you
everybody
see you
good day thank you
