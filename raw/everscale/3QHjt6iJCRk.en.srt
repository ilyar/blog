there um the thing is this right so
 

477
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,630
there um the thing is this right so
uh the

478
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:36,640
uh the
 

479
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,509
uh the
i i don't think um that there's that

480
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
i i don't think um that there's that

i i don't think um that there's that
it's a

482
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880

precedent that every time there's a vote

there could be 25 more after that you
know and then it just fuels the fire of

492
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240

um are gonna be upset but the reality is
 

521
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,190
um are gonna be upset but the reality is
that we also

522
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
that we also
 

523
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,230
that we also
are voting for things that either do or

524
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
are voting for things that either do or
 

525

do not have value
 

527
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,310
do not have value
and if for whatever reason the majority

528

and if for whatever reason the majority
 

529
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,829
and if for whatever reason the majority
of the voters felt that it wasn't it's

530
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
of the voters felt that it wasn't it's
 

531

of the voters felt that it wasn't it's
just you know it's one of those things

593
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,470

but i think we

594
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
but i think we
 

595
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,310
but i think we
don't have all the facts together at

596
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
don't have all the facts together at
 

597
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,030
don't have all the facts together at
this point and should probably

598
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040
this point and should probably
 

599
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,190
this point and should probably
move on from here

600
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200
move on from here
 

601
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,069
move on from here
and with that um

602
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
and with that um
 

603
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,389
and with that um
i'd like to bring in our wonderful media

i am
i think

612
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
i think
 

613
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,150
i think
hi oh so um

614
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160

 

615
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,389

last week was obviously

616
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
last week was obviously
 

617
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,150
last week was obviously
a very kind of intense one because

618
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
a very kind of intense one because
 

619
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,069
a very kind of intense one because
the network almost stopped well it

620
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
the network almost stopped well it
 

621
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,389
the network almost stopped well it
stopped sometime and then we had the

622
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
stopped sometime and then we had the
 

623
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,190
stopped sometime and then we had the
sunset incident that

624
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,200
sunset incident that
 

625
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,750
sunset incident that
the validators because because

626
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
the validators because because
 

627
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,509
the validators because because
not only the network stalled for a few

628
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:37,519
not only the network stalled for a few
 

629
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,110
not only the network stalled for a few
minutes but it's also

630
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
minutes but it's also
 

631
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,990
minutes but it's also
some shards also stalled

632
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,000
some shards also stalled
 

633
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,990
some shards also stalled
and that prevented

634
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000
and that prevented
 

635
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,990
and that prevented
um

636
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
um
 

637
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,870
um
some

638
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:46,880
some
 

639
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,389
some
um

640
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
um
 

641
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,230
um
not some but all the bulls basically

642
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,240

 

643
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,189

it created a situation where where

644
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:55,199
it created a situation where where
 

645
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,629
it created a situation where where
i don't want to go into the details

646
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:58,639
i don't want to go into the details
 

647
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,670
i don't want to go into the details
but

648
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,680
but
 

649
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,750
but
um because of some time

650
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
um because of some time
 

651
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,550
um because of some time
uh

652
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
uh
 

653
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,069
uh
incompatibility

654
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,079
incompatibility
 

655
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,829
incompatibility
between

656
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
between
 

657
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,189
between
the new election time and what was in

configuration smart contracts the
dipoles could not

dipoles could not
 

667
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,310
dipoles could not
uh could not join the elections and that

668
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
uh could not join the elections and that
 

669
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,910
uh could not join the elections and that
left the network working with the

670
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:25,920
left the network working with the
 

671
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,910
left the network working with the
previous set of validators and in order

672
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:27,920
previous set of validators and in order
 

673
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,949
previous set of validators and in order
to resolve this situation well it's very

674
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
to resolve this situation well it's very
 

675
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,030
to resolve this situation well it's very
it's quite simple it's just that

676
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
it's quite simple it's just that
 

677
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,110
it's quite simple it's just that
validators had to

678
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120
validators had to
 

679
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,750
validators had to
submit their stakes directly which some

680
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:37,760
submit their stakes directly which some
 

681
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,710
submit their stakes directly which some
of them did

682
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:40,720

 

683
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,030

and the network for one

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,509
the number of value this has been
reduced a very small number

692
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519

 

693
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,670

basically which is which is kind of

694
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
basically which is which is kind of
 

695
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,710
basically which is which is kind of
normal in terms of that is expected but

696
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:56,720
normal in terms of that is expected but
 

697
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,470
normal in terms of that is expected but
of course it's not normal in terms of

698
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:58,480
of course it's not normal in terms of
 

699
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,069
of course it's not normal in terms of
how networks should have been configured

700
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:02,079
how networks should have been configured
 

701
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,910
how networks should have been configured
um but again

702
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
um but again
 

703
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,430
um but again
a reminder that

704
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,440
a reminder that
 

705
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,590
a reminder that
the network was configured very long

706
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600
the network was configured very long
 

707
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,949
the network was configured very long
time ago based on configs that

708
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
time ago based on configs that
 

709
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,509
time ago based on configs that
was developed by

710
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:13,519
was developed by
 

711
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,750
was developed by
you know in the

712
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:15,760
you know in the
 

713
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,829
you know in the
world old very old configs developed for

714
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839
world old very old configs developed for
 

715
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,990
world old very old configs developed for
a very old network

716
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000
a very old network
 

717
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,430
a very old network
but we're still using them um

718
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,440
but we're still using them um
 

719
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,470
but we're still using them um
and

720
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
and
 

721
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,389
and
part of this reason we're using them is

722
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
part of this reason we're using them is
 

723
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,470
part of this reason we're using them is
because it's the the delector smart

724
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
because it's the the delector smart
 

725
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,150
because it's the the delector smart
contracts are still not uh operational

726
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,160
contracts are still not uh operational
 

727
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,870
contracts are still not uh operational
so anyway um

728
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:34,880
so anyway um
 

729
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,949
so anyway um
we fixed everything

730
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:36,959
we fixed everything
 

731
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,030
we fixed everything
basically we fixed the problem with the

732
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
basically we fixed the problem with the
 

733
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,350
basically we fixed the problem with the
network fixed problem with shards

734
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
network fixed problem with shards
 

735
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,749
network fixed problem with shards
and uh and uh

736
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:43,759
and uh and uh
 

737
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,629
and uh and uh
we

738
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639

 

739
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,670

it what the the only the good thing

740
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
it what the the only the good thing
 

741
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,990
it what the the only the good thing
is that suddenly everyone

742
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,000
is that suddenly everyone
 

743
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,430
is that suddenly everyone
uh has upgraded their notes

744
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,440
uh has upgraded their notes
 

745
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,790
uh has upgraded their notes
puree

746
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
puree
 

747
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,269
puree
like

748
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279

 

749
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,910

hallelujah

um
so

754
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079
so
 

755
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,550
so
if we need to stop the network every

756
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
if we need to stop the network every
 

757
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,269
if we need to stop the network every
time for you know the validators to

758
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
time for you know the validators to
 

759
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,509
time for you know the validators to
upgrade their notes

760
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519
upgrade their notes
 

761
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,670
upgrade their notes
um we will do that

762
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
um we will do that
 

763
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,110
um we will do that
no problem

764
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120
no problem
 

765
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,710
no problem
it's a deal

766
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:16,720
it's a deal
 

767
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,069
it's a deal
let's do that

768
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:18,079
let's do that
 

769
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,710
let's do that
i hope you like it guys

770
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
i hope you like it guys
 

771
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,629
i hope you like it guys
well anyway um

772
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:24,639

 

773
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,110

jokes aside but seriously

774
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,120
jokes aside but seriously
 

775
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,389
jokes aside but seriously
um

776
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:28,399
um
 

777
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,629
um
like parts of the reason not the parts

778
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:30,639
like parts of the reason not the parts
 

779
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,470
like parts of the reason not the parts
but the entire reason why the networks

780
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
but the entire reason why the networks
 

781
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,550
but the entire reason why the networks
told in the first place

782
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
told in the first place
 

783
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,829
told in the first place
was because of some smart contracts

784
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:37,839
was because of some smart contracts
 

785
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,470
was because of some smart contracts
that executed some

786
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
that executed some
 

787
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,670
that executed some
uh

788
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
uh
 

789
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,990
uh
something that was fixed already is

790
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
something that was fixed already is
 

791
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,749
something that was fixed already is
fixed already for months we just cannot

792
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
fixed already for months we just cannot
 

793
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,790
fixed already for months we just cannot
upgrade

794
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:48,800
upgrade
 

795
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,829
upgrade
the bloody network in time

796
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839
the bloody network in time
 

797
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,629
the bloody network in time
so

798
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:52,639
so
 

799
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,629
so
in a way it's like a vicious cycle which

800
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:54,639
in a way it's like a vicious cycle which
 

801
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,140
in a way it's like a vicious cycle which
which is which is um

802
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,150
which is which is um
 

803
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,430
which is which is um
[Music]

804
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
[Music]
 

805
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,189
[Music]
came to an end

806
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
came to an end
 

807
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,749
came to an end
or at least one of the cycles that came

808
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:01,759
or at least one of the cycles that came
 

809
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,269
or at least one of the cycles that came
to an end

810
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
to an end
 

811
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,270
to an end
because of this

812
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,280
because of this
 

813
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,350
because of this
the network stall so

814
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360
the network stall so
 

815
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,189
the network stall so
it's crazy a little bit nevertheless

816
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
it's crazy a little bit nevertheless
 

817
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,710
it's crazy a little bit nevertheless
we have an upgrade

818
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
we have an upgrade
 

819
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,069
we have an upgrade
to the network

820
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,079
to the network
 

821
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,189
to the network
going out

822
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
going out
 

823
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,510
going out
today

824
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
today
 

825
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,750
today
this upgrade

826
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
this upgrade
 

827
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,110
this upgrade
also unfortunately need to be rolled out

828
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120

 

829
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,990

slowly

830
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000

 

831
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,270

because

832
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
because
 

833
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,950
because
in harsh conditions when the network

834
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
in harsh conditions when the network
 

835
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,190
in harsh conditions when the network
stopped we did release the upgrade but

836
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
stopped we did release the upgrade but
 

837
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,990
stopped we did release the upgrade but
we didn't release the upgrade with the

838
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
we didn't release the upgrade with the
 

839
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,310
we didn't release the upgrade with the
like we didn't ask everyone to fix

840
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,320
like we didn't ask everyone to fix
 

841
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,190
like we didn't ask everyone to fix
because

842
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,200
because
 

843
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,350
because
then for sure the network would stop

844
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360
then for sure the network would stop
 

845
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,549
then for sure the network would stop
completely

846
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:42,559
completely
 

847
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,270
completely
so we didn't ask everyone to repair the

848
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280
so we didn't ask everyone to repair the
 

849
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,789
so we didn't ask everyone to repair the
database

850
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
database
 

851
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,789
database
so because of that

852
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
so because of that
 

853
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,950
so because of that
we don't know actually the real number

854
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:50,960
we don't know actually the real number
 

855
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,710
we don't know actually the real number
of repair database currently on the

856
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:52,720
of repair database currently on the
 

857
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,710
of repair database currently on the
network and as such we cannot rely just

858
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:56,720
network and as such we cannot rely just
 

859
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,789
network and as such we cannot rely just
we cannot just release an upgrade we

860
00:17:58,789 --> 00:17:58,799
we cannot just release an upgrade we
 

861
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,350
we cannot just release an upgrade we
need to be extra cautious

862
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
need to be extra cautious
 

863
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,150
need to be extra cautious
i'm not taking i'm not taking this risk

864
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,160
i'm not taking i'm not taking this risk
 

865
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,750
i'm not taking i'm not taking this risk
that the network will stop for like two

866
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
that the network will stop for like two
 

867
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,990
that the network will stop for like two
hours if

868
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,000
hours if
 

869
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,390
hours if
if the

870
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,400
if the
 

871
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,750
if the
the number of nodes that with the

872
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:11,760
the number of nodes that with the
 

873
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,590
the number of nodes that with the
repaired database

874
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,600
repaired database
 

875
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,669
repaired database
is not sufficient

876
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:15,679
is not sufficient
 

877
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,150
is not sufficient
therefore

878
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,160
therefore
 

879
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,190
therefore
we did some some

880
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200

 

881
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,510

some changes

882
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:25,520
some changes
 

883
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,549
some changes
the the current upgrade that is going to

884
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
the the current upgrade that is going to
 

885
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,150
the the current upgrade that is going to
be released today

886
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,160
be released today
 

887
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,390
be released today
is going to

888
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:31,400
is going to
 

889
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,830
is going to
mandatorily like

890
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
mandatorily like
 

891
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,470
mandatorily like
uh fix the

892
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
uh fix the
 

893
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,990
uh fix the
fix the database

894
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000
fix the database
 

895
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,029
fix the database
or run the fix anyway if your database

896
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
or run the fix anyway if your database
 

897
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,630
or run the fix anyway if your database
is fixed then it shouldn't take more

898
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:42,640
is fixed then it shouldn't take more
 

899
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,990
is fixed then it shouldn't take more
than a few minutes

900
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,000
than a few minutes
 

901
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,750
than a few minutes
if it's not then it can take up to two

902
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760
if it's not then it can take up to two
 

903
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,310
if it's not then it can take up to two
hours so the upgrade will be

904
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,320
hours so the upgrade will be
 

905
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,950
hours so the upgrade will be
rolling out today slowly

906
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:50,960
rolling out today slowly
 

907
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,909
rolling out today slowly
again with the same procedure basically

908
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:53,919
again with the same procedure basically
 

909
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,470
again with the same procedure basically
you ask

910
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:56,480

 

911
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,950

you ask the telegram contact contacts

912
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:58,960
you ask the telegram contact contacts
 

913
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,150
you ask the telegram contact contacts
that

914
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,160
that
 

915
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,029
that
um

916
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:01,039
um
 

917
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,510
um
that we will be part of the upgrade

918
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:03,520
that we will be part of the upgrade
 

919
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,150
that we will be part of the upgrade
announcement and you go there and you

920
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,160
announcement and you go there and you
 

921
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,510
announcement and you go there and you
ask them for

922
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
ask them for
 

923
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,549
ask them for
like

924
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:08,559
like
 

925
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,870
like
release notes and and uh

926
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:10,880
release notes and and uh
 

927
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,110
release notes and and uh
and where like how to upgrade

928
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,120
and where like how to upgrade
 

929
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,390
and where like how to upgrade
instructions

930
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,400
instructions
 

931
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,390
instructions
and that's um and then you upgrade your

932
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:16,400
and that's um and then you upgrade your
 

933
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,070
and that's um and then you upgrade your
node

934
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
node
 

935
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,150
node
a wait if the database need to be

936
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160
a wait if the database need to be
 

937
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,510
a wait if the database need to be
repaired

938
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
repaired
 

939
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,190
repaired
whatever it takes one hour two hours

940
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200
whatever it takes one hour two hours
 

941
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,430
whatever it takes one hour two hours
sometimes even three hours but that's

942
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,440
sometimes even three hours but that's
 

943
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,789
sometimes even three hours but that's
what it is and uh and that's it um

944
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:28,799
what it is and uh and that's it um
 

945
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,630
what it is and uh and that's it um
once you're done we your note is

946
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:30,640
once you're done we your note is
 

947
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,029
once you're done we your note is
operational we will see the new version

948
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:33,039
operational we will see the new version
 

949
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,590
operational we will see the new version
of the blogs coming out and

950
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:35,600
of the blogs coming out and
 

951
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,669
of the blogs coming out and
then we know that the database has been

952
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:37,679
then we know that the database has been
 

953
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,830
then we know that the database has been
repaired

954
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:39,840
repaired
 

955
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,789
repaired
we are thinking about

956
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:42,799
we are thinking about
 

957
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,150
we are thinking about
how to

958
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,160
how to
 

959
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,230
how to
prevent the situations of

960
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
prevent the situations of
 

961
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,510
prevent the situations of
non-upgrade nodes and there are some

962
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,520
non-upgrade nodes and there are some
 

963
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,510
non-upgrade nodes and there are some
ideas that we are entertaining right now

964
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:51,520
ideas that we are entertaining right now
 

965
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,669
ideas that we are entertaining right now
including the idea of the validator

966
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:53,679
including the idea of the validator
 

967
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,350
including the idea of the validator
would not be able to

968
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,360
would not be able to
 

969
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,150
would not be able to
submit their notes to the elections

970
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160
submit their notes to the elections
 

971
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,789
submit their notes to the elections
if the notice were not running

972
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:00,799
if the notice were not running
 

973
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,430
if the notice were not running
the mandatory update software

974
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,440

 

975
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,630

so

976
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:06,640
so
 

977
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,029
so
this is still in discussion

978
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:09,039
this is still in discussion
 

979
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:09,990
this is still in discussion
but

980
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,000
but
 

981
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,390
but
there's something that needs to be done

982
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
there's something that needs to be done
 

983
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,270
there's something that needs to be done
um

984
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:13,280
um
 

985
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,390
um
we're not

986
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:14,400
we're not
 

987
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,710
we're not
we're not a bitcoin network where you

988
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:16,720
we're not a bitcoin network where you
 

989
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,110
we're not a bitcoin network where you
can take your time and upgrade and half

990
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,120
can take your time and upgrade and half
 

991
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,470
can take your time and upgrade and half
a year

992
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480
a year
 

993
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,310
a year
like

994
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,320
like
 

995
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,669
like
we are much more

996
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:23,679
we are much more
 

997
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,990
we are much more
dynamically developed network

998
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,000
dynamically developed network
 

999
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,549
dynamically developed network
with may way more updates

1000
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:28,559
with may way more updates
 

1001
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,669
with may way more updates
um with may way more changes

1002
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
um with may way more changes
 

1003
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,270
um with may way more changes
and in general just more demanding in

1004
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
and in general just more demanding in
 

1005
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,549
and in general just more demanding in
terms of the

1006
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559
terms of the
 

1007
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,950
terms of the
you know the software and everything

1008
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:38,960
you know the software and everything
 

1009
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,230
you know the software and everything
and the operations exactly as well so um

1010
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240
and the operations exactly as well so um
 

1011
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,510
and the operations exactly as well so um
so therefore we

1012
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520
so therefore we
 

1013
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,190
so therefore we
we cannot allow

1014
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,200
we cannot allow
 

1015
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,669
we cannot allow
the validators just sit on upgrade and

1016
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:49,679
the validators just sit on upgrade and
 

1017
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,710
the validators just sit on upgrade and
you know not doing anything um basically

1018
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
you know not doing anything um basically
 

1019
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,870
you know not doing anything um basically
not operating their nodes

1020
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:54,880
not operating their nodes
 

1021
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,430
not operating their nodes
and so on you cannot be lazy validator

1022
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440
and so on you cannot be lazy validator
 

1023
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,029
and so on you cannot be lazy validator
or or you should be punished for that i

1024
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
or or you should be punished for that i
 

1025
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,549
or or you should be punished for that i
mean you should not be allowed to be

1026
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:00,559
mean you should not be allowed to be
 

1027
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,470
mean you should not be allowed to be
validator like that

1028
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:02,480
validator like that
 

1029
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,430
validator like that
again it's a it's not just a

1030
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:05,440
again it's a it's not just a
 

1031
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,789
again it's a it's not just a
some kind of

1032
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:06,799
some kind of
 

1033
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,750
some kind of
token mining exercise or minting

1034
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:09,760
token mining exercise or minting
 

1035
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,190
token mining exercise or minting
exercise

1036
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,200
exercise
 

1037
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,950
exercise
it's maintaining

1038
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
it's maintaining
 

1039
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,430
it's maintaining
the fastest the most scalable

1040
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,440
the fastest the most scalable
 

1041
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,710
the fastest the most scalable
computing network in the world

1042
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
computing network in the world
 

1043

00:36:59,589 --> 00:36:59,599
yeah so uh if we view the option uh we
 

1841
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,990
yeah so uh if we view the option uh we
can see the current phase which is the

1842
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:02,000
can see the current phase which is the
 

1843
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,829
can see the current phase which is the
open phase and

1844
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:03,839
open phase and
 

1845
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,069
open phase and
we can see the current market price

1846

we can see the current market price
timer

1848
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:07,200
timer
 

1849
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,710
timer
uh which means that well it's like the

1850
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:10,720
uh which means that well it's like the
 

1851
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,349
uh which means that well it's like the
the ever refreshing time ever refreshing

1852
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:13,359
the ever refreshing time ever refreshing
 

1853
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,630
the ever refreshing time ever refreshing
price

1854
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:14,640
price
 

1855
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,430
price
so we have the oracle price and we have

1856
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:17,440
so we have the oracle price and we have
 

1857
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,430
so we have the oracle price and we have
the minimum lot size which is the

1858
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:19,440
the minimum lot size which is the
 

1859
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,589
the minimum lot size which is the
minimum amount you can buy

and
so the

1864
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:23,839
so the
 

1865
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,750
so the
this

1866
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:25,760

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,750
uh using the uh the price that was
second

2056
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:19,760
second
 

2057
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,790
second
like the second best price

2058
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:22,800
like the second best price
 

2059
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,710
like the second best price
so my bit is confirmed

2060
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:24,720
so my bit is confirmed
 

2061
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,510
so my bit is confirmed
i can still save save my data and uh

2062
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:27,520
i can still save save my data and uh
 

2063
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,309
i can still save save my data and uh
i've already input the

2064
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:30,319
i've already input the
 

2065
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,950
i've already input the
amount over minimum lot size

2066
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:32,960
amount over minimum lot size
 

2067
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,190
amount over minimum lot size
and uh yeah we're just waiting for a

2068
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:35,200
and uh yeah we're just waiting for a
 

2069
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,829
and uh yeah we're just waiting for a
minute now uh if ever if anyone has um

2070
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:37,839
minute now uh if ever if anyone has um
 

2071
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,109
minute now uh if ever if anyone has um
any more questions we're happy to answer

2072
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:41,119
any more questions we're happy to answer
 

2073
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,630
any more questions we're happy to answer
but uh yeah generally it's it's like the

2074
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:44,640
but uh yeah generally it's it's like the
 

2075
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,309
but uh yeah generally it's it's like the
probably the first implementation of the

2076
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:46,319
probably the first implementation of the
 

2077
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,190
probably the first implementation of the
auctions uh

2078
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:49,200
auctions uh
 

2079
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,670
auctions uh
yeah i think the like the first

2080
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:51,680
yeah i think the like the first
 

2081
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,109
yeah i think the like the first
one of the one of the first

2082
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:53,119
one of the one of the first
 

2083
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,790
one of the one of the first
implementations of the of the options

2084
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:54,800
implementations of the of the options
 

2085
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,430
implementations of the of the options
right now i think we'll have the

2086
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:57,440
right now i think we'll have the
 

2087
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,829
right now i think we'll have the
improvement for this later

2088
00:41:59,829 --> 00:41:59,839
improvement for this later
 

2089
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,710
improvement for this later
uh including the debug interface for uh

2090
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:02,720
uh including the debug interface for uh
 

2091

2094
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:08,880
interface which is implemented in smart
 

2095
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,109

uh for smaller amounts and um
 

2103
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,589
uh for smaller amounts and um
yeah i think a few

2104

2199
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,230

let's see uh

2200
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:20,240

 

2201
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,550

should i see should i see never seen the

2202
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:22,560
should i see should i see never seen the
 

2203
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,710
should i see should i see never seen the
in the yes but you have you probably

2204
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:24,720
in the yes but you have you probably
 

2205
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,870
in the yes but you have you probably
have to refresh the the interface to see

2206
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:26,880
have to refresh the the interface to see
 

2207
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,270
have to refresh the the interface to see
them i didn't send you the

2208
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:29,280
them i didn't send you the
 

2209
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,190
them i didn't send you the
the root address for the token so you

2210
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:31,200
the root address for the token so you
 

2211
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,750
the root address for the token so you
probably don't see it in the in your um

2212
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:33,760
probably don't see it in the in your um
 

2213
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,230
probably don't see it in the in your um
ever wallet but if you refresh the web

2214
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:36,240
ever wallet but if you refresh the web
 

2215
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,870
ever wallet but if you refresh the web
page you should probably see it in

2216
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:38,880
page you should probably see it in
 

2217
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,750
page you should probably see it in
in

2218
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:39,760

00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,829
which is i think what can be what this
is what what it can be called i think

2388
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:03,839
is what what it can be called i think
 

2389
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,390
is what what it can be called i think
for uh for such a blockchain that's

2390
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:06,400
for uh for such a blockchain that's
 

2391
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,549
for uh for such a blockchain that's
attracted so much liquidity but was

2392
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:08,559
attracted so much liquidity but was
 

2393
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,750
attracted so much liquidity but was
still vulnerable enough and uh

2394
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:11,760
still vulnerable enough and uh
 

2395
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,630
still vulnerable enough and uh
what what i think was wrong with with it

2396
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:14,640
what what i think was wrong with with it
 

2397
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,270
what what i think was wrong with with it
from my point of view uh to be honest i

2398
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:17,280
from my point of view uh to be honest i
 

2399
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,230
from my point of view uh to be honest i
didn't dig

2400
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:18,240
didn't dig
 

2401
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,430
didn't dig
well too deep into it but i think the

2402
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:21,440
well too deep into it but i think the
 

2403
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,470
well too deep into it but i think the
uh

2404
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:22,480
uh
 

2405
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,470
uh
what was wrong with it with was the

2406
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:24,480
what was wrong with it with was the
 

2407
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,510
what was wrong with it with was the
reserves that they had were not

2408
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:27,520
reserves that they had were not
 

2409
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,710
reserves that they had were not
um liquid enough for them to cover all

2410
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:30,720
um liquid enough for them to cover all
 

2411
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,589
um liquid enough for them to cover all
the

2412
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:31,599
the
 

2413
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,549
the
all the scenarios and um

2414
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:34,559
all the scenarios and um
 

2415
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,309
all the scenarios and um
it's it's not it's not exactly it's not

2416
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:36,319
it's it's not it's not exactly it's not
 

2417
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,950
it's it's not it's not exactly it's not
precisely just because of the the fact

2418
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:38,960
precisely just because of the the fact
 

2419
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,390
precisely just because of the the fact
that it wasn't liquid enough was a

2420
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:40,400
that it wasn't liquid enough was a
 

2421
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,430
that it wasn't liquid enough was a
result of attack and uh and the result

2422
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:43,440
result of attack and uh and the result
 

2423
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,630
result of attack and uh and the result
itself is is uh is actually

2424
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:46,640
itself is is uh is actually
 

2425
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,309
itself is is uh is actually
but anyway i don't want to go deeper

2426
00:48:48,309 --> 00:48:48,319
but anyway i don't want to go deeper
 

2427
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:49,910
but anyway i don't want to go deeper
into that right i understand but you

2428
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:49,920
into that right i understand but you
 

2429
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,030
into that right i understand but you
didn't like dig into that but anyway uh

2430
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:53,040
didn't like dig into that but anyway uh
 

2431
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,549
didn't like dig into that but anyway uh
we will have to

2432
00:48:54,549 --> 00:48:54,559
we will have to
 

2433
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:55,430
we will have to
like

2434
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:55,440
like
 

2435
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,630
like
the auctions part actually is the is the

2436
00:48:58,630 --> 00:48:58,640
the auctions part actually is the is the
 

2437
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,109
the auctions part actually is the is the
what difference between between our

2438
00:49:01,109 --> 00:49:01,119
what difference between between our
 

2439
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,150
what difference between between our
design and the luna design more or less

2440
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:04,160
design and the luna design more or less
 

2441
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,109
design and the luna design more or less
and within this mechanism

2442
00:49:07,109 --> 00:49:07,119
and within this mechanism
 

2443
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,750
and within this mechanism
um the the protection lies within this

2444
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:09,760
um the the protection lies within this
 

2445
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,589
um the the protection lies within this
mechanism actually

2446
00:49:11,589 --> 00:49:11,599
mechanism actually
 

2447
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,390
mechanism actually
but in order to make it even more

2448
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:14,400
but in order to make it even more
 

2449
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,510
but in order to make it even more
protective

2450
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:15,520
protective
 

2451
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,870
protective
we may be

2452
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:16,880
we may be
 

2453
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,589
we may be
uh we may add some protection mechanism

2454
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:19,599
uh we may add some protection mechanism
 

2455
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,030
uh we may add some protection mechanism
to the auctions

2456
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,040
to the auctions
 

2457
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,390
to the auctions
in the coming

2458
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:22,400
in the coming
 

2459
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,510
in the coming
like

2460
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:23,520
like
 

2461
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,030
like
couple of months

2462
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:25,040
couple of months
 

2463
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,670
couple of months
um but we will have to formulate it

2464
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:27,680
um but we will have to formulate it
 

2465
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,950
um but we will have to formulate it
with vadandru

2466
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:30,960

 

2467
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,549

and then maybe we

2468
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:32,559
and then maybe we
 

2469
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,069
and then maybe we
will need to add you know all the

2470
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:34,079
will need to add you know all the
 

2471
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,069
will need to add you know all the
implementations we'll need to consider

2472
00:49:36,069 --> 00:49:36,079
implementations we'll need to consider
 

2473
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,990
implementations we'll need to consider
adding these mechanisms

2474
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:38,000
adding these mechanisms
 

2475
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,990
adding these mechanisms
on top to prevent

2476
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:40,000
on top to prevent
 

2477
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,510
on top to prevent
the kind of attack

2478
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:41,520
the kind of attack
 

2479
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,109
the kind of attack
precisely that

2480
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:43,119
precisely that
 

2481
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,190
precisely that
because i think this is the only

2482
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:45,200
because i think this is the only
 

2483
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,510
because i think this is the only
possible attack on this mechanism

2484
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:47,520
possible attack on this mechanism
 

2485
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,710
possible attack on this mechanism
actually

2486
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:48,720
actually
 

2487
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,630
actually
um like

2488
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:50,640
um like
 

2489
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,870
um like
and uh and um

2490
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:52,880
and uh and um
 

2491
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,710
and uh and um
and that mechanism may prevent this

2492
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:54,720
and that mechanism may prevent this
 

2493
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,910
and that mechanism may prevent this
attack

2494
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:55,920
attack
 

2495
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,829
attack
from from

2496
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:56,839
from from
 

2497
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:58,710
from from
happening

2498
00:49:58,710 --> 00:49:58,720
happening
 

2499
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,790
happening
even if you don't have like billions of

2500
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:00,800
even if you don't have like billions of
 

2501
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,589
even if you don't have like billions of
dollars in liquidity behind the

2502
00:50:03,589 --> 00:50:03,599
dollars in liquidity behind the
 

2503
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,589
dollars in liquidity behind the
behind the number

2504
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:05,599
behind the number
 

2505
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,990
behind the number
well we'll have to we'll have to

2506
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:08,000
well we'll have to we'll have to
 

2507
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,109
well we'll have to we'll have to
um

2508
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:09,119
um
 

2509
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,549
um
review the

2510
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:10,559
review the
 

2511
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,309
review the
the

2512
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:12,319
the
 

2513
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,309
the
the all the possible attack vectors

2514
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:14,319
the all the possible attack vectors
 

2515
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:15,750
the all the possible attack vectors
anyway uh

2516
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:15,760
anyway uh
 

2517
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,829
anyway uh
a bit later with this was like the first

2518
00:50:17,829 --> 00:50:17,839
a bit later with this was like the first
 

2519
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,750
a bit later with this was like the first
of the first implementation by by the

2520
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:19,760
of the first implementation by by the
 

2521
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,990
of the first implementation by by the
way we have 50 seconds until the the

2522
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:22,000
way we have 50 seconds until the the
 

2523
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,510
way we have 50 seconds until the the
open phase ends

2524
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:23,520
open phase ends
 

2525
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,030
open phase ends
this bit actually takes a little more

2526
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:25,040
this bit actually takes a little more
 

2527
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,230
this bit actually takes a little more
time to confirm on the network so um i

2528
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:28,240
time to confirm on the network so um i
 

2529
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,510
time to confirm on the network so um i
i'll ask you

2530
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:29,520
i'll ask you
 

2531
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,390
i'll ask you
whoever is playing still to send your

2532
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:32,400
whoever is playing still to send your
 

2533
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,589
whoever is playing still to send your
transactions

2534
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:33,599
transactions
 

2535
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,190
transactions
i think norm

2536
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:35,200
i think norm
 

2537
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,230
i think norm
is uh i'll come back to you to one bill

2538
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:38,240
is uh i'll come back to you to one bill
 

2539
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,470
is uh i'll come back to you to one bill
we'll confirm the transactions i'll come

2540
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:40,480
we'll confirm the transactions i'll come
 

2541
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,309
we'll confirm the transactions i'll come
back to the security thing

2542
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:42,319
back to the security thing
 

2543
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,030
back to the security thing
uh norm and everyone else who's playing

2544
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:45,040
uh norm and everyone else who's playing
 

2545
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,270
uh norm and everyone else who's playing
please make your bids

2546
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:47,280
please make your bids
 

2547
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,589
please make your bids
so it should be

2548
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:49,599
so it should be
 

2549
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,109
so it should be
i think a little more than the oracle

2550
00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:51,119
i think a little more than the oracle
 

2551
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,910
i think a little more than the oracle
suggests or well whatever amount you

2552
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:53,920
suggests or well whatever amount you
 

2553
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,950
suggests or well whatever amount you
want

2554
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:54,960
want
 

2555
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,510
want
if you want to win uh i've put my price

2556
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:57,520
if you want to win uh i've put my price
 

2557
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,829
if you want to win uh i've put my price
is 0-22 in reality you shouldn't see

2558
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:01,839
is 0-22 in reality you shouldn't see
 

2559
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:05,510
is 0-22 in reality you shouldn't see
that but

2560
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:05,520

 

2561
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,030

i wonder if my beat actually went

2562
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,040
i wonder if my beat actually went
 

2563
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,750
i wonder if my beat actually went
through yes i did okay cool

2564
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:09,760
through yes i did okay cool
 

2565
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,190
through yes i did okay cool
it just takes a little more time in

2566
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:11,200
it just takes a little more time in
 

2567
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,270
it just takes a little more time in
reality you wouldn't see my bit so it's

2568
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:13,280
reality you wouldn't see my bit so it's
 

2569
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,030
reality you wouldn't see my bit so it's
like a blind auction

2570
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:15,040
like a blind auction
 

2571
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,470
like a blind auction
um

2572
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:16,480
um
 

2573
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,990
um
i'm now confirming

buy
like

2582
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:24,319
like
 

2583
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,309
like
four more

2584
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:26,319
four more
 

2585
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:27,910
four more
evers

2586
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:27,920
evers
 

2587
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,510
evers
and confirm my beat

2588
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:31,520

 

2589
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,829

so yeah uh going back to

2590
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:34,839
so yeah uh going back to
 

2591
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:36,470
so yeah uh going back to
um

2592
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:36,480
um
 

2593
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,430
um
do the security stuff um

2594
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:39,440
do the security stuff um
 

2595
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,510
do the security stuff um
yeah i believe the the auction

2596
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:41,520
yeah i believe the the auction
 

2597
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,190
yeah i believe the the auction
uh the the the nature of this

2598
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:45,200
uh the the the nature of this
 

2599
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,990
uh the the the nature of this
system with the auctions should uh

2600
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:48,000
system with the auctions should uh
 

2601
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,390
system with the auctions should uh
probably be

2602
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:50,400
probably be
 

2603
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,390
probably be
more

2604
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:52,400
more
 

2605
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,990
more
i guess resistant

2606
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:54,000
i guess resistant
 

2607
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,549
i guess resistant
to to such things

2608
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:56,559
to to such things
 

2609
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:57,349
to to such things
uh

2610
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:57,359
uh
 

2611
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,030
uh
but we'll have to

2612
00:51:59,030 --> 00:51:59,040
but we'll have to
 

2613
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,510
but we'll have to
we'll probably have to play with it

2614
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:01,520
we'll probably have to play with it
 

2615
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,790
we'll probably have to play with it
more to test it more with uh different

2616
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:04,800
more to test it more with uh different
 

2617
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,790
more to test it more with uh different
scenarios to see how

2618
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:06,800
scenarios to see how
 

2619
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,069
scenarios to see how
it can be um attacked with uh

2620
00:52:10,069 --> 00:52:10,079
it can be um attacked with uh
 

2621
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,150
it can be um attacked with uh
like different amounts of money with

2622
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:12,160
like different amounts of money with
 

2623
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,430
like different amounts of money with
different amounts of uh

2624
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:15,440
different amounts of uh
 

2625
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,390
different amounts of uh
participants and uh maybe with

2626
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:18,400
participants and uh maybe with
 

2627
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,910

so yeah i believe um
that will have to go through the

2664
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:10,240
that will have to go through the
 

2665
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,230
that will have to go through the
through a more thorough testing with

2666
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:12,240
through a more thorough testing with
 

2667
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,750
through a more thorough testing with
this to prevent uh things like

2668
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:15,760
this to prevent uh things like
 

2669
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,069
this to prevent uh things like
those that happen to luna

2670
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:18,079
those that happen to luna
 

2671
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,750
those that happen to luna
and um

2672

to
 

2677
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,349
to
to get any suggestions to to sort of to

2678
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:25,359
to get any suggestions to to sort of to
 

2679
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:27,510
to get any suggestions to to sort of to
test it better or to

2680
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:27,520
test it better or to
 

2681
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,390
test it better or to
to

2682
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:28,400
to
 

2683
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,870
to
improve the reliability and security of

2684
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:30,880
improve the reliability and security of
 

2685
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,309
improve the reliability and security of
this

2686
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:34,319

 

2687
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:35,589

but yeah

2688
00:53:35,589 --> 00:53:35,599
but yeah
 

2689
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,190
but yeah
i think this is a more

2690
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:37,200
i think this is a more
 

2691
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,470
i think this is a more
robust system for sure

2692
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:40,480
robust system for sure
 

2693
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,270
robust system for sure
and the more a little bit more complex

2694
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:43,280
and the more a little bit more complex
 

2695
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,990
and the more a little bit more complex
to be to be honest i

2696
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:46,000
to be to be honest i
 

2697
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,549
to be to be honest i
i had to spend some more time to to get

2698
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:48,559
i had to spend some more time to to get
 

2699
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,349
i had to spend some more time to to get
into it but uh but but you know that

2700
00:53:51,349 --> 00:53:51,359
into it but uh but but you know that
 

2701
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,990
into it but uh but but you know that
this the auction um

2702
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:54,000
this the auction um
 

2703
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,309
this the auction um
is actually like you understand that

2704
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:56,319
is actually like you understand that
 

2705
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:59,270
is actually like you understand that
these only very large bits should be

2706
00:53:59,270 --> 00:53:59,280
these only very large bits should be
 

2707
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,950
these only very large bits should be
allowed right

2708
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:00,960
allowed right
 

2709
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,950
allowed right
the whole point of this that's uh

2710
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:02,960
the whole point of this that's uh
 

2711
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,309
the whole point of this that's uh
you need it's one actually one of the

2712
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:04,319
you need it's one actually one of the
 

2713
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,230
you need it's one actually one of the
protective mechanisms as well

2714
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:06,240
protective mechanisms as well
 

2715
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,910
protective mechanisms as well
yeah you need to put a lot of money into

2716
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:07,920
yeah you need to put a lot of money into
 

2717
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,549
yeah you need to put a lot of money into
that like million uh tokens or something

2718
00:54:10,549 --> 00:54:10,559
that like million uh tokens or something
 

2719
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,630
that like million uh tokens or something
yeah right now it's for testing purposes

2720
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:12,640
yeah right now it's for testing purposes
 

2721
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,390
yeah right now it's for testing purposes
only but yeah

2722
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:14,400
only but yeah
 

2723
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,190
only but yeah
sure the oh my bid actually won

2724
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:17,200
sure the oh my bid actually won
 

2725
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:17,990
sure the oh my bid actually won
okay

i didn't
 

2729
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,230
i didn't
so the oracle price was

2730
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:22,240
so the oracle price was
 

2731
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,829
so the oracle price was
0.21

2732
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:25,839

 

2733
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,190

i've

2734
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:27,200
i've
 

2735
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,430
i've
uh are actually running oracle in the

2736
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:29,440
uh are actually running oracle in the
 

2737
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,990
uh are actually running oracle in the
background nom is asking

2738
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:32,000
background nom is asking
 

2739
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,270
background nom is asking
yes there is an oracle in the background

2740
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:35,280
yes there is an oracle in the background
 

2741
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,349
yes there is an oracle in the background
why

2742
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:37,359
why
 

2743
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,910
why
uh yeah that's true

2744
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:39,920
uh yeah that's true
 

2745
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,750
uh yeah that's true
uh so yeah i'm gonna claim my evers now

2746
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:43,760
uh so yeah i'm gonna claim my evers now
 

2747
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,950
uh so yeah i'm gonna claim my evers now
and uh

2748
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:44,960
and uh
 

2749
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,670
and uh
i have to confirm the transaction

2750
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:47,680
i have to confirm the transaction
 

2751
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,349
i have to confirm the transaction
i think that

2752
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:51,359

 

2753
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:54,150

everyone else can actually buy

2754
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:54,160
everyone else can actually buy
 

2755
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,109
everyone else can actually buy
uh evers as well after i claim mine

2756
00:54:57,109 --> 00:54:57,119
uh evers as well after i claim mine
 

2757
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,870
uh evers as well after i claim mine
using the the interface i think it

2758
00:54:58,870 --> 00:54:58,880
using the the interface i think it
 

2759
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,789
using the the interface i think it
should work

2760
00:55:00,789 --> 00:55:00,799
should work
 

2761
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:02,309
should work
uh

2762
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:02,319
uh
 

2763
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:03,670
uh
okay

2764
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:03,680
okay
 

2765
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:09,829
okay
yeah it should my ever should claim soon

2766
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:09,839

 

2767
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:10,710

yeah

2768
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:10,720
yeah
 

2769
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,750
yeah
should be

2770
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:11,760
should be
 

2771
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,430
should be
should be good now unfortunately i

2772
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:13,440
should be good now unfortunately i
 

2773
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,349
should be good now unfortunately i
didn't remember i don't i didn't i don't

2774
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:15,359
didn't remember i don't i didn't i don't
 

2775
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,349
didn't remember i don't i didn't i don't
remember how many evers i had before so

2776
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:17,359
remember how many evers i had before so
 

2777
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,990
remember how many evers i had before so
i don't know if they actually came back

2778
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:20,000
i don't know if they actually came back
 

2779
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,630
i don't know if they actually came back
let's see maybe i had a transaction

2780
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:22,640
let's see maybe i had a transaction
 

2781
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,910
let's see maybe i had a transaction
i had just say minus five evers

2782
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:25,920
i had just say minus five evers
 

2783
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,870
i had just say minus five evers
yeah uh i didn't come back yet

2784
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:28,880
yeah uh i didn't come back yet
 

2785
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,069
yeah uh i didn't come back yet
uh

2786
00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:30,079
uh
 

2787
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,309
uh
the oracle auction integration is on the

2788
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:32,319
the oracle auction integration is on the
 

2789
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:35,430
the oracle auction integration is on the
next phase um

2790
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:35,440
next phase um
 

2791
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,390
next phase um
yeah well maybe for some teams but we

2792
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:38,400
yeah well maybe for some teams but we
 

2793
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,430
yeah well maybe for some teams but we
actually made it uh for for this one

2794
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:41,440
actually made it uh for for this one
 

2795
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,150
actually made it uh for for this one
we have the oracle running and um

2796
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:44,160
we have the oracle running and um
 

2797
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,430
we have the oracle running and um
refreshing the price every i think 15

2798
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:47,440
refreshing the price every i think 15
 

2799
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,109
refreshing the price every i think 15
seconds or something

2800
00:55:49,109 --> 00:55:49,119
seconds or something
 

2801
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:50,150
seconds or something
and

2802
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:50,160
and
 

2803
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,870
and
yeah they're as far as i know there will

2804
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:52,880
yeah they're as far as i know there will
 

2805
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,750
yeah they're as far as i know there will
be the next phase which will had which

2806
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:55,760
be the next phase which will had which
 

2807
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,950
be the next phase which will had which
will have the

2808
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:56,960
will have the
 

2809
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,390
will have the
improved functionality and maybe

2810
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:58,400
improved functionality and maybe
 

2811
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,589
improved functionality and maybe
something else

2812
00:55:59,589 --> 00:55:59,599
something else
 

2813
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,109
something else
i didn't see the proposal yet

2814
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:03,119
i didn't see the proposal yet
 

2815
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,510
i didn't see the proposal yet
i haven't seen it yet

2816
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:05,520
i haven't seen it yet
 

2817
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,589
i haven't seen it yet
but yeah we'll see i think it's going to

2818
00:56:07,589 --> 00:56:07,599
but yeah we'll see i think it's going to
 

2819
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,190
but yeah we'll see i think it's going to
be interesting as well

2820
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:09,200
be interesting as well
 

2821
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,589
be interesting as well
so uh yeah

2822
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:11,599
so uh yeah
 

2823
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,950
so uh yeah
this is uh how this whole thing works

2824
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:14,960
this is uh how this whole thing works
 

2825
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,109
this is uh how this whole thing works
it's pretty easy and complicated at the

2826
00:56:17,109 --> 00:56:17,119
it's pretty easy and complicated at the
 

2827
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,589
it's pretty easy and complicated at the
same time if you drive deep deeper into

2828
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:19,599
same time if you drive deep deeper into
 

2829
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,270
same time if you drive deep deeper into
it but on the interface side we um we

2830
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:23,280
it but on the interface side we um we
 

2831
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,349
it but on the interface side we um we
try to make it as

2832
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:25,359
try to make it as
 

2833
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:26,150
try to make it as
like

2834
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:26,160
like
 

2835
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,069

everscale um or to blockchain at all
 

3153
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:26,710
everscale um or to blockchain at all
and they're a little bit concerned uh

3154
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:26,720
and they're a little bit concerned uh
 

3155
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,910
and they're a little bit concerned uh
that this is not um you know kosher so

3156
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:29,920
that this is not um you know kosher so
 

3157

to speak

3158
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:30,960
to speak
 

3159
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,789
to speak
so if we can get the easy pay people

3160
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:32,799
so if we can get the easy pay people
 

3161
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:33,829
so if we can get the easy pay people
back

3162
01:02:33,829 --> 01:02:33,839
back
 

3163
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:35,670
back
to explain that that would be really

3164
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:35,680
to explain that that would be really
 

3165
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,990
to explain that that would be really
really really good because

3166
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:38,000
really really good because
 

3167
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,870
really really good because
uh at the moment it's just another debit

3168
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:40,880
uh at the moment it's just another debit
 

3169
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,230
uh at the moment it's just another debit
card and

3170
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:42,240
card and
 

3171
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,990
card and
and they're thinking that maybe they're

3172
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:44,000
and they're thinking that maybe they're
 

3173
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,349
and they're thinking that maybe they're
just using every scale as a means to

3174
01:02:47,349 --> 01:02:47,359
just using every scale as a means to
 

3175
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:48,950
just using every scale as a means to
find customers

3176
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:48,960
find customers
 

3177
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,309
find customers
in which case

3178
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:50,319
in which case
 

3179
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,309
in which case
that's probably

3180
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:52,319
that's probably
 

3181
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:55,029
that's probably
you know not a good thing

3182
01:02:55,029 --> 01:02:55,039
you know not a good thing
 

3183
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:56,230
you know not a good thing
so that's it

3184
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:56,240
so that's it
 

3185
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,789
so that's it
okay yeah that's definitely important

3186
01:02:58,789 --> 01:02:58,799

01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,430
um in general i agree that revoting
things is a bad idea but it shouldn't be

3520
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:13,440
things is a bad idea but it shouldn't be
 

3521
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,510
things is a bad idea but it shouldn't be
it should be it's not technically

3522
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:15,520
it should be it's not technically
 

3523
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,709
it should be it's not technically
impossible

3524
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:16,719
impossible
 

3525
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,870
impossible
and it shouldn't be because sometimes

3526
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:18,880
and it shouldn't be because sometimes
 

3527
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,510
and it shouldn't be because sometimes
you do want to rediscuss things think of

3528
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:21,520
you do want to rediscuss things think of
 

3529
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,829
you do want to rediscuss things think of
them from a different point of view

3530
01:09:23,829 --> 01:09:23,839
them from a different point of view
 

3531
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,749
them from a different point of view
whatever whatever

3532
01:09:25,749 --> 01:09:25,759
whatever whatever
 

3533
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:26,950
whatever whatever
so

3534
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:26,960
so
 

3535
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,030
so

3536
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:29,040
take a proposal
 

3537
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,229
take a proposal
yeah that's

3538
01:09:30,229 --> 01:09:30,239
yeah that's
 

3539
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:33,590
yeah that's
oops losing myself here that's an idea

3540
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:33,600
oops losing myself here that's an idea
 

3541
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,550
oops losing myself here that's an idea
um

3542
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:34,560
um
 

3543
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,829
um
for the dune community to go together

3544
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:37,839
for the dune community to go together
 

3545
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,070
for the dune community to go together
make a proposal discuss things get the

3546
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:40,080
make a proposal discuss things get the
 

3547
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,990
make a proposal discuss things get the
facts together and maybe make a proposal

3548
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:42,000
facts together and maybe make a proposal
 

3549
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,870
facts together and maybe make a proposal
to

3550
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:42,880
to
 

3551
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,990
to
re-vote this could be a solution because

3552
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:46,000
re-vote this could be a solution because
 

3553
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,229
re-vote this could be a solution because
they didn't know of it then and they

3554
01:09:48,229 --> 01:09:48,239
they didn't know of it then and they
 

3555
01:09:48,239 --> 01:09:50,070
they didn't know of it then and they
didn't have tokens to really have a

3556
01:09:50,070 --> 01:09:50,080
didn't have tokens to really have a
 

3557
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,149
didn't have tokens to really have a
voice anyway if they had known about it

3558
01:09:52,149 --> 01:09:52,159
voice anyway if they had known about it
 

3559
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:52,870
voice anyway if they had known about it
so

3560
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:52,880
so
 

3561
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,350
so
maybe that's maybe that's a solution

3562
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:57,360

 

3563
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,149

so

3564
01:09:58,149 --> 01:09:58,159
so
 

3565
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:59,750
so
um

3566
01:09:59,750 --> 01:09:59,760
um
 

3567
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,149
