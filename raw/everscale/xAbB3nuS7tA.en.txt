livestream i'm not that good
how is everyone
real life
now you have to do it oh here we go well
well i've been learning mr bojangles
[Music]
i don't know if anyone can actually hear
that by the way
it's coming through
oh there me foreign
[Music]
that old soft shoe
and that's all you get folks
there we go how's that for an intro to
the call
as well the on splashing for me
pub music
[Laughter]
oh that's not nice
why not
what not what what did i say wrong
nothing
he said
feels good
i used to play the classical guitar my
parents couldn't afford a piano so they
got me a classical guitar
face saving too
those pianos
[Music]
all right let's wait a few minutes we're
still a little short and light so
we try to uh buy a full sized piano for
dionne a while back because she plays uh
quite well
and uh she got all the way to the uh
ladies house which was pretty much two
cities over so a good 40 50 mile drive
and they realized this thing weighed
what was it maybe
i don't know
300 kilos and would have smashed the
suspension so they tried to drag it a
little bit gouged holes in the ladies
floor and then had to give up
so
yeah so they just left with their tails
between their legs i'm sorry
good delivery planning
oh wow
on the stream
you just got called kurt cobain
yeah yeah
[Music]
we're starting off lively today
awesome
well let's see um
[Music]
i guess we can start yeah i think so
okay
welcome
everybody uh thank you for coming to
everscale community column number 91.
um we only have a couple of
presentations today but they're um
they're chock full of information really
packed so we're gonna have
we're going to have a lot of info today
despite the fact that we're
you know not uh you know diversified uh
as we usually are which i think probably
is a good thing
uh just a little bit of call etiquette
for anybody that might be viewing us for
the first time uh please turn your
cameras on uh please save your questions
until each presenter is finished and use
the raise your hand feature in zoom to
do so
uh for our beloved youtube guests please
write your questions in the youtube
stream and i see there's already one
uh and we'll get to it at the very end
of the call
and as a matter of formality uh the call
is the is conducted in english only so
let's go ahead and hop right in uh
technical updates are first as always
mita you can start us off
yeah
well we're still not
not delivered the update to the network
it takes a little longer because
it's a little bit uh complicated
because the changes we are going to
introduce are breaking changes
and
the problem with that
is it's not only breaking changes in
terms of the node it's also breaking
changes in terms of the sdk and all of
that which follows
and that means that
we kind of need to find a way
to
kind of gracefully
change without breaking
everyone's applications out there
so
and the problem with that is that
unfortunately
the previous design didn't accommodate
for any extension extensions it wasn't
extendable it isn't extendable at all
so like
someone who designed that didn't think
that the design would never ever need to
be
extended to anything like that's the
final design this is as great as it gets
and so on and so forth you know that
drill
so well apparently it is not so
it's need to be upgraded
and
with many things
current upgrades and the future upgrades
so anyway
this is there's a lot of internal kind
of
discussions how to do that properly
were conducted in the end we kind of
settled on something it's not yet fully
implemented and there's also because it
involves also the transition plan
for for the sdk and you know the
applications the users involves all
these applications that runs
and serves like tens of thousands of
users currently
and you cannot just go lightly about
that because of the like you know
user experience should not be
such that you open applications suddenly
stop working
so um yeah so
it will take
a little bit more time i'm not sure how
much
um
hopefully
maybe this week
if not next week but
working hard on that
um
it was to all test that like all the
changes that we wanted we all did it
like what's all chat tested the new
instructions there are five of them
five or six of them
they're all working they're all have
been forwardly tested there are some
upgrades that um
apart from that that's also are
important to create security upgrades
but um
so this is the status
currently
about that
um it's not that critical but
still
so the another thing is that
um i think
there was a uh
was released a
road map forever scale
um
i think yesterday something
so this one
and i just want to kind of comment ask
me to comment on several things uh which
relates to what ever x is doing and
everex's new name for tone labs if we
didn't know
so
yeah
we have a new logo as well thanks john
and
so yeah so let me comment on this part
of the of the roadmap
maybe
so first of all
in terms of
um some of the dates
provided here are kind of and we got a
lot of questions uh in several chats
some kwpc chats as well
or like um
the the flex is listed on q3
[Music]
um well i can tell you that dance is
listed in q4
well while obviously
this is just um
just things that probably i said and and
um
you know instead of when you put a
roadmap right you cannot put soon there
that's really unfortunate
so i think they just they just
multiplied whatever i said by by a
factor of three
um
and you know if you want to give a
commitment then that's probably what you
need to do and that's the problem with
dates and the road maps right because
you as i'm telling you right now nobody
simply nobody
the hell knows when these things will be
delivered okay this is a true state of
the development of anything which is a
little bit more complicated than
you know
than three
lines of code
so um
but in
like so there are no
real dates
but um when you
press to make an assumption then the
best strategy you could uh
you know choose in order not to be
hold accountable is just to multiply
everything you say by some factor of
whatever
you choose the factor
right three four five whatever so that's
what you see here more or less
and uh the things that are in delivery
in q1
is like something that has already been
done more or less
i think well at least i'm talking about
our our stuff like whatever
um neverexes
is
uh
you know responsible for
so when you see here flex q3 no flex is
not coming it's q3 it will come much
much sooner than that
but i just wanted to kind of so don't
don't panic there's a lot of people go
back to why
why why q3 plex no no flex is not coming
into you q3 so don't worry but
just to be on the safe side it's it
states q3
so that's one thing um
i wanted to say
another thing is um that so
like bottom line many of the things that
are that are
uh stated here will come much sooner
than it is stated here but for the for
the for the safety of the kind of road
map
they're they're just there's even more
time
right
um
okay so um i just want to comment on few
things the
um
[Music]
the decrease in gas
that it says up to 100 x there will be a
decrease of gas that's for sure this
quarter i'm not sure it will be i'm sure
it won't be 100 x
and uh the reason for that is
because you need a whole other range of
technologies
to
support economically the scalability of
the system
so um
so
in order to do that you need really the
dynamic gas season which is listed in q3
um
because you cannot because without that
you cannot start new work chain and
without starting a new work chain
you anyway there is a limit of
scalability in one word chain anyway
right there just physical limit of the
of the blocks that you can transmit over
the network currently
and so
if you make it hundred x smaller the
fees you will end up
in salon a situation
um of course not exactly in salon
situation because i think we can sustain
like more gps on one work chain
but still it is very close to salon
situation where it costs nothing to to
spam the network and if it costs nothing
to spawn the network someone will come
and spam the network
all right
so you need it in dynamic svs so there
is a trade of somewhere so the gas fees
will decrease but not by not by 100 100
ticks
i mean that's one thing
um then
like um
then there are some other things that i
want to mention for example there's new
things that you see and they got the
questions about that so there's a gauche
git on chain source holder
and this is a new project we're doing
and it's it's um it's a git basically on
chain and it's mentioned in the white
paper actually so we're just executing
white paper
and i also want to comment i heard
somewhere someone said
that
not the white paper won't be like won't
be
the everex part of white paper
won't be
necessarily fully
developed well that's not the case in
our from our perspective
everything that is written technically
in white paper talking about technical
part of the white paper
is
in the plan or is already been developed
so it will be developed fully because we
don't have currently no we i don't have
any problem with specs like all the
specs
we believe are solid
and uh need to be done
um so and that's really for for us the
road map there is nothing new in terms
of the ever ox
uh operating system there is there is
nothing new that um maybe some things
are actually missing in this roadmap
that we are going to do
but because their roadmap shouldn't be
that detailed but we are still on track
to implement everything that white paper
is talking about one of the things white
paper is talking about is git on chain
guitar is an extremely important for
many many many aspects that i don't want
to learn to touch just for the security
of the network first thing like we are
right now with every not only we like
not only ever scale like every
blockchain is holding its repositories
on some centralized git repository
owned by
microsoft or gitlab in general right
um
and this is a huge problem this is
really a really huge problem it's a
security problem
and and it is it is uh
the centralization problem who decide
what the the repositories the
centralized repositories they all they
always have one
owner
a single person who owns them and and
that is that is a huge problem in the
decentralized world of course so we need
to fix that and and several other things
so we're working on that
we hope to show demos sometimes in may
so yeah so that's um that's the
questions that i got about this ones
um
there are other questions i think that
ron would put
me there
yeah i did you can answer them now
at the end of the call oh yeah i'm
already talking about about the roadmap
so can you use drivechain as database
no you can use blockchain as a database
drive chain is for storage like it's
it's storage so drive chain is listed in
q4 and actually and in fact i think this
is correct timing
because drive chain is is
not yet been implemented but of course
we are definitely planning to do that
um never never uh the questions about
never ever and never there is a tip
three stable coin expansion stated here
i'm not going to to because it's a part
of defy alliance
and uh uh actually questions to defy
alliance so um
not even defy alliance but i think defy
some governments because they run
this ever-never
stable coin contest so i don't know vlad
maybe we'll be able to
yeah i think they're actually going to
talk about it
okay from my perspective uh that that's
all questions i got if you have any
questions about our parts basically ever
os is is what uh everex is doing
most of it except for the key snark
protocol which already been implemented
by new foundation team and will be
uh this quarter we will try to push that
into into production
um and other than that
flex of course which which is which is
coming and decentralized fund management
protocol maybe because like it's one of
the protocols has been presented by kwpc
so i can answer on that as well thank
you very much
um we do have a couple questions uh
michael first
yeah i'm just wondering whether you can
share that into the telegram group
there's a jpeg so that we can circulate
it on socials and i think more
importantly to the
uh to the investors and our ecosystem
doctor
sorry to interrupt i will share the
presentation with all these materials
into the group
let's build the pdf
awesome
okay ivan you have a question
isn't it necessary to have drive chain
uh running
for doing the this gauche
stuff or dry chain is not needed here
why is it earlier than drive
drive chain is not necessary drive chain
is only necessary for storing binaries
yeah i know a lot of people storing
binaries in git git
but git is not built for that in general
you can do that because like you can
store everything anywhere and you can
store files and file system right so
yeah so in order to store binaries you
will need to drive chain and we are
going to enable the storage of the
binaries in gauche but when the
direction will be ready beforehand you
won't be able to store
binaries
and how how do you expect the uh like
size of uh
repositories for example everex
repositories in gosh
um
like
it's um
the gosh maybe it's not the time to talk
about that maybe we'll have another
session on if you want on on the
architecture of gosh
but uh
the single contract can store
without any problem after up to 200 2
500 uh
lines of code
around that number 3000 something
because it's compressed so um so because
we don't see this
like these rarely see files which are
more than that
you can usually store them in just one
basically message
so
we don't we don't see any problems
actually one contract can accumulate
more than that but yeah no but several
messages i'm talking about one message
okay
and thank you for your question ivan uh
we have a question from michael cabana
excuse me frogger
michael
yeah hi guys uh mitch i would like to
chase back the issue about the dark
rules uh the last time we spoke uh it
was the 10th of february the approximate
date of their launch what's the current
status would you mind telling the
audience thank you
yep the dark rules have i think passed
by now formal verification stage
uh it has now been integrated into
websites we will release the interfaces
to dark posts this week so you can start
in because i got some some inquiries
about that so you can start uh
integrating your whatever applications
you have with dark tools so you can
you know show them status of them in
your application
and once these front ends for their
tools will be ready
then you will be able to like
you know use them basically just
we're working on user interfaces the
dark tools already
okay cool thank you
all right thank you
uh ivan if you have another question go
ahead if not can you put your hand down
thank you all right uh let's move on uh
we have uh michael gord obviously with
us who's already introduced himself uh
from gda capital um there were a few
questions in the chats about the status
of
the uh
ton startup competition which now is the
everscale startup competition so michael
uh we'll go to you for for all the
details please
yeah so
we
just finished um
about a week and a half ago the
uh registration we had
about 275
teams that that registered
which was about 50
50 projects
everything from
nft marketplaces defy tools
kind of social tools
not all built on
every scale unfortunately but but quite
a bit
um the three teams that and we've had
we've had it judged by
um
[Music]
by the gda capital team the td5 team
uh nikita uh from preton and then
another
um
another investment group uh jane euro
capital
um we have prepared
um
a communication to the market for
medium
that
uh highlights
um what we uh suggest as
as the three winners then two
uh honorary mentions uh if anyone in
this group wants to
um
wants to see the full selection
i'm happy to share it and uh and if you
guys can or if anyone can uh
can complete the
judging um you know in the next 24 hours
then we could perhaps
uh
release it
uh wednesday or thursday as opposed to
today but
we're getting quite a lot of
messages
from devpost which is the the platform
we used
um
about when uh the winners are gonna be
on it are gonna be announced so so we
would like to get it out
um
the three
the three uh products that
um
that uh that we have uh currently
uh got as as the three winners are
uh convo space
which is
a social app that
is actually cross-chained so it
integrates into several other
blockchains as well
and that
that allows you to have all your
conversations in one place with one line
of code
um so that was pretty cool and the other
two let me just
see the names
um the other two are
dream base
which uh is a
nft
or actually dream base is a
platform focused on the africa audience
to be able to
have
a community and an nft ecosystem around
music and around writing
so
any
writing can actually be
uh minted as an nft
on the platform
um
i thought it was pretty cool and then
the third is demeter which is a
an nft
charity
auction platform in marketplace
all three of these projects actually
have
quite
quite built out
teams and technology so
um i think that it's it's quite possible
that they continue
um and what i would suggest as a
follow-up to
to this
competition
is
um is us linking this to a
um ever scale accelerator that can
perhaps
um work with these
uh with not necessarily all of them but
work with some of the groups that we
think
um
are marketable and that we can we can
scale
to get to the point where they they're
able to you know close their seed series
a rounds and and become marketable
um and i think that would also result in
quite a lot of
of publicity if we introduce a kind of
early stage accelerator to
uh ever scale accelerator to markets and
then that some of these teams start to
start to enter the accelerator
i think it would also present a way to
generate some cash flows
that could be reinvested into
into the network and that kind of ties
into the crystal handshake
program that is
um for more established businesses i
think this this uh like a an early stage
accelerator kind of fills the gap in
um in getting projects from
[Music]
uh from like this this very early
unfunded stage
um
that you know a three-month program kind
of thing five-month program where
um it's an accelerated way for them to
raise their first you know one to five
million bucks and then
uh and then to
to be able to deploy that further into
uh into scaling to get to the point
where they can access the crystal
handshake program so that's that's one
suggestion that i have to move forward
uh in addition i think that uh whether
we do an accelerator or not and i'm
happy to uh to hear all of your
feedbacks and i'm also happy to kind of
champion the putting together of it
um i think that it might be worthwhile
for us to
follow up with
um
any of the relevant teams that
are building on everscale so that
ideally
whether we are like formally working
with them in an accelerated capacity or
not i think it's in our best interest
for
as many of them as possible to come to
like introduce to the market
their um
uh like you know that they have that
they're building on everscale and why
um i think also be great if
if we can kind of leverage this to
expand the number of nodes
um so those are kind of thoughts on on
what i would what i would do with the
um with these now like 275 people that
are
are are
you know somewhat in the
um
[Music]
in more or less capacity in the
everscale ecosystem
and to continue to bring them in further
um and then also we got uh
we had about 25 000
uh views on the website the top 10
startup website which i think is pretty
good with with no paid ads just uh just
organic
um yeah so that's that's kind of a
summary of
of the
of the numbers from the
from the event and then my my
suggestions on what we should
follow up with uh specifically the
accelerator the uh like having a node
program
um
and
you know further bringing these
organizations like new startups into our
ecosystem
yeah absolutely fantastic
i actually had a question for you is it
possible to get uh one or all of these
folks maybe
to come on next tuesday's call
yeah yeah that's a really good idea i
think that it's you know good publicity
for
for all of them it'll give us a good
indicator especially the three winners i
think for sure um i think it'll give us
a good indicator of whether there are
serious projects that want to continue
uh if they are you know if they i mean
if they are open to coming and
presenting then that is
a level of additional credibility that
you know they're serious and that we
should invest more time into them so
yeah that's a that's a good suggestion i
i'm happy to uh put that in motion and
maybe maybe it won't happen like all of
them next tuesday but maybe the next
yeah yeah no no no you can be uh we can
be bringing them in
yeah no pressure um just dm me
all right yeah we'll do any any other
thoughts
anybody have a question anybody have a
thought
i guess not
michael so
awesome um
yeah people think that um or don't
object and think it's
uh it's not a bad idea
i'm happy to
over the next uh week or two
uh put together some branding around um
what an accelerator like early stage
accelerator might look like
um
that uh that we can perhaps
um
bring
uh a cohort from
from this into and kind of think about
how to how to take it to market
but that was the
yeah pardon sorry i cut you off sorry
someone have a question
yeah actually al alex does
yeah michael thank you very much the uh
my question is you started answering
already is about the next steps uh like
what's coming next uh from you guys
you started answering about the
accelerator
and will there be like the second uh
hackathon
already under the everscale brand
yeah yeah well definitely we're gonna
totally shelve the top ton startup brand
and the next the next one we do in in
this startup competition capacity will
be um will be focused on everscale
uh with new upper scale branding
um
the initial
like plan we came to market with this
was that
we use this as a
as a launching ground to set up an
accelerator and kind of roll businesses
or funnel businesses from
startup incubation to acceleration to
uh getting through pistol huns getting
to the crystal hands program so
um
so yeah that's unless anyone objects um
that's that's the next step for us
um
i'm happy to uh to share progress on it
uh next week or the following week and
if any of you want to participate in
any capacity and an accelerator that
would be
that would be welcome
um and then similarly um
nodes and uh and further bringing them
into the ecosystem so um i think wrong
suggestion of
of uh of them presenting here to see if
they're see how serious they are
is is also good um
so that that's on the
on the startup competition i guess i'll
pause now if anyone has any other
questions or comments or or feedback
um
i have another suggestion that i'd like
to bring up with everyone or thought
uh does anybody
i don't i don't think there's any
objection i think it's a great idea
um all right awesome so i'll start to
i'll start to put together
um some material around that
um and then my other
uh suggestion i'd like to bring up so
um
we have
uh
participated in some quite large
activations or i should say like full
brand full enterprise brand integrations
of protocols
um where essentially the protocol
like buys the licensing rights
for
a sports team or for a musician or for
some iconic asset that has you know the
more fans the better
um
where from the um sports franchise or
from the musician's perspective they're
thinking about it in terms of how do i
raise sponsorship
like how because because they're not
thinking about the nft
value or like the value of the data on
the blockchain um
so it's it's it's really skewed
economics in in my opinion and from
from uh what i have like directly been
involved in it's been
an enormous return on investment
um for for the network in in the sense
that they're they put some uh cash or
tokens or consideration
uh on the table
uh and it results in
uh in a market cap increase that is
significantly larger than the amount of
cash that was put on the table so it
kind of becomes free
um and just to go back for a sec these
sports teams or musicians think in terms
of sponsorship
uh they don't understand nfts whereas
for us
we think about this in terms of how do
we bring activity to a blockchain how do
we bring nft's usefulness users uh
awareness scale et cetera
to uh
to a blockchain so it's it's quite a lot
of arbitrage that they're thinking about
it as sponsorship and we're thinking
about it as
buying data buying and buying nft rights
um so i have a couple
um
couple groups that like sports sports
teams and
musicians celebrities that that we've
been we've been talking to you about
this
um that i think every scale would be a
really good fit for
um so and it was a positive wonder if
anyone has any
any suggestions but i think we have just
the thing
i think we have just the thing i'll dm
you separately
awesome yeah because my thoughts here is
that we've got like
quite a
um there's there's quite a lot of
quite a significant treasury that is you
know
with a mandate to
uh invest into
bringing adoption
um and from we've done a couple of these
before that have have been like a really
positive roi
um and i think that if we do do you know
one two then
the
notoriety and the public awareness of
the everscale blockchain
will start to
start to accelerate a ton so yeah ron
i'm happy to
to chat after this and
include you and
it calls with these groups and uh
see uh see what we can do
yeah i'm i'm gonna uh if you don't mind
i'm just gonna form a small group uh
with you and a couple of people that
that i'm with and
i'll toss uh my idea in there
perfect
can i ask another quick one well we have
michael
active um of course
michael i just know i also know just
couple of weeks ago that you guys uh sj
capital have a metaverse subsidiary saw
it on twitter quite a few times forgot
the name but it's something like meta
versus averse group yeah another group
are there any synergies with the uh
whatever scale that you've been thinking
about or not really maybe oh yeah for
sure
yeah for sure so so metaverse group is
is uh is vertically integrated in the
metaverse real estate market so it owns
a portfolio of lands
is building experiences on the land so
um
we're doing a we're doing a like a
commercial district a fashion
fashion district we're going to have
shopping
like shopping centers we've got a stage
for concerts we've got an art gallery
for
nfts
this is all in decentralens that we have
have been building but we own uh land
across
um across about a half dozen other uh
other popular metaverses uh sandbox
omnia space with the voxels world etc
um
so
um the two
two synergies that that i see
uh and and i should i should add that
metaverse group as an organization the
intention and and i only uh like uda
owns owns only a minority in that now
it was basically acquired by tokens.com
which is a public speaking company that
i am very keen to
get into the uh
into the crystal hands program and
actually did verbally commit and then uh
long story short took a while and
and now it's now it's time in limbo but
um but that would be really good and
still is definitely
um low hanging
but the objective is uh to take it
public and that it is not a venture
capital um so it's it's focused on more
um like the majority of the portfolio is
decentralized sandbox which we can
generate yields from take the company
public and
um you know have uh have an roi
separately uh our our plan is to
launch a
metaverse fund
uh called meadowverse ventures um
that
uh that is
that fills the gap of
being able to invest into
uh into equity into tokens and into
um
more uh
you know experimental metaverses
uh newer metaverses i could say
um we have uh
we have some interest we're really
looking to close on the lead right now
um
but uh i am
uh confident that
that will have it live
um for
q2
um
so yeah the two the two synergies that i
see
is
uh one we are doing a
uh no we decentraland is doing the
metaverse fashion week uh on our estates
in
in the fashion district
uh meadowbrook fashion week is gonna
have activations from 28 of the biggest
retail brands in the world
um
i i think you know many of which if not
all of which uh
are our name brands that that we've all
heard of
um and it's gonna be so there's gonna be
like uh
um you know a runway a bunch of
a bunch of stores with luxury brands
that have nft wearables
um
and uh and a bunch of side events
uh so
so
um you know decentralize on ethereum
unfortunately for
forever scale but i think that
it would still perhaps have value to
have an activation
for everscale
uh during this week and some some like
you know to either have uh an art
exhibit um as a side event or to have
a side runway with um with designers we
can really be flexible in
in what we do um we have a stage we have
an art gallery we've got uh conference
sensors that that we can
that we can leverage uh for free it's no
uh no cost to us
um
so
so so that's that's one like doing
activations uh on on our lands
um
and then two
is that i see that
uh on the roadmap there is
um there's
metaverse um
plans for for the everscale blockchain
so uh certainly as
metaverses are being built on everscale
uh that of course there's lots
yeah there are there are several
from korea as well potentially
yes
all right
that's
good stuff man
really good stuff does anybody have a
question for uh michael regarding this
michael
awesome
thank you so very much
you're on me
um thanks thanks for watching that and
just before we move on um one i wonder
whether you have any any ideas about uh
synergies with the metaverse group or uh
or perhaps we could take it offline if
uh if you'd like to brainstorm together
yeah i think yeah but let's let's take
it offline um uh let's let's connect and
uh i think there are several people that
we can uh actually uh form a group
around and uh who have very good ideas
we also we also just for uh for context
for everyone
we did
a
virtual metaverse summit
last week yeah last week 10 and 11. uh
we had 4 000 people register
and i believe nikita and and someone
else from forever scale i can't remember
hill uh we're on panels um there was
2000 people that actually
actually watched um 400 to 600 people in
any channel
in the audience in any panel
um so that's pretty cool we'll do more
of those
good actual stuff excellent stuff thank
you
thank you very much just uh blowing away
here
michael thank you as always
oh
and your internet connection is awesome
okay let's uh let's move on to our
second presentation so uh we have uh
well
the vlad of all vlads as i referred to
him from broxas
um hey he's got a lot to talk about a
lot of updates
i'll let you do a number not a lot but a
number a number
uh yeah so let me maybe uh take it from
from
on the scale roadmap here so um
just let me share it
[Music]
yeah yeah so a few questions also
concerning the development of different
sections and how the the roadmap was
built
actually
so
it's not an easy task to build the
roadmap of a decentralized network
because
you need to talk to a lot of people uh
from different uh
well sub governance is here but
community sub communities
i don't know what world is not uh
prohibited now
you know scale i don't know i don't know
yes uh yes uh so what we did actually we
talked to a lot of people and
gathered together the vision
of the development of
uh different streams
in every scale
the terms uh are approximate as media
said so you cannot just
make it for sure so when
typically in
i.t development and specifically in the
blockchain development
it's it doesn't work like this so if you
can't do it faster you typically don't
wait and do it faster but uh
it
sometimes it happens that the deadlines
shifts and
that's that's always
worse than
specifying the much later deadline and
doing it faster actually
uh so yeah uh this is actually the
direction where we
would like the everscale to go in this
year and it's it's quite a lot and
i personally know not so many uh
other blockchains
of our level who
have moved significantly further than us
and
of course they have some much
uh lot has disappeared i think
yeah okay i was hoping it wasn't me i
have a scale but i'm also speaking about
it yeah
you disappeared you disappeared for
about 15 20 seconds
sorry sorry sorry you were saying that
there are not a lot of uh blockchains
like ours uh but and then you can
yeah i'm saying that not so many other
blockchains who are
more advanced in terms of ecosystems
than us
and certain things that
will appear on our scale so
hopefully they will appear uh
first
and uh
in terms of communication and marketing
so this is the year when we are going to
fix that and finally uh make the solid
and streamlined marketing for for
everscale and projects in it
uh i'm also speaking about boxes so
because this is
our priority for this year not only
deliver
good products but also
tell about them uh in a loud voice and
yeah
saying about the about them across the
world so uh let me maybe comment a few
few things on the roadmap as well
especially what concerns them
defy sub governance
so uh there are several contests that uh
uh
going to to finish so the first one is
the ssi framework so it's
one of its stages stage 3 has just
finished and there were two teams
actually who delivered very good
implementations and
i am really keen to see
[Music]
they move further and deliver better
uh better results and
with community of one team
uh leaded by stephan gasuni so we will
uh host the ama session in his channel
crypto s7
where
more than 4 000 subscribers and
this is one of our first experiences of
speaking to external audiences and
external communities and
we will
start to do this regularly
so
not only internal ama sessions but also
attracting some some guys from from
outside
uh
so and if you have any ideas of such
communities where we can we can
be speakers and uh run an ama session so
please you can thank me or nikita so uh
let's arrange this of course so and
we will put a really good focus on this
uh next thing is tips three tips three
stable coins expansion this is not only
about uh never stablecoin which
definitely will will move further the
only thing that we will need to address
and discuss uh this thursday
is uh
the funding
of balance mechanism of never i will not
suggest what to put the things now so
we'll keep it to thursday uh mita and i
i'm really uh
expecting you to be there so let's
discuss this on thursday
uh
yeah
next in terms of defy primitives so this
is a decentralized fund management
protocols tokenization frameworks and
much
bigger
number of bridges bridges to
major ecosystems that will facilitate uh
the transfer not only of liquidity but
rather also uh
making everscale a hub for cross chain
applications
this is not an easy task
as you may have seen from the work
wormhole exploit and some other exploits
that happen to bridges
across the blockchain universe
so but
i'm sure
that
there is a solution and we will find it
uh speaking about uh
roxas bridge specifically so as we
announced in our roadmap
we will be adding at least three new
blockchains which are
avalanche
tron and solana
so and we will be doing this
hopefully really soon
maybe some other blockchains will also
come this year
uh
also a good point here on is on
alliances uh like cardinal system
alliance and texas ecosystem alliance
and maybe some other blockchains will
also come
and
we are now experimenting with
such
such way of expansion of heavy scale
when we find a really strong player
in in the system of other blockchain and
we try to find to find the pain points
of their communities and
help the communities with with other
scale
for the benefit of the scale of course
but also for the benefit of those
communities
uh so right what is happening right now
so as you may have seen uh so we have
the
uh
for the moment uh one will reach from
cardano to every scale but soon it will
be uh bidirectional
uh the cardano-oriented decks uh but
this is not not the
priority to have the decks for cardano
users but
rather this uh
is an added feature so a sergey set on
the mx session
so and
yeah so
if you're interested so you can
listen to it once again
uh yeah so uh and also there is a very
nice point i'm really uh positive about
is a gamify and metaverse uh
stream that it's it's really
modest now so like gamify pilots and
metaverse sdk
but uh there are a lot of things
standing behind those two points and i
think that uh and i'm sure that we will
see first experiments to appear
uh
already
maybe in a month or two so when
this is just the beginning and
more points will appear on the roadmap
as
as we move further and
it becomes more clear and obvious what
to do um
yeah so uh this is
some some comments on the on the road
map um
next thing i wanted to talk about is the
uh migration to a new standard of
fungible tokens which is named tip 3.1
so that is happening right now so um
for several days already brooks team is
migrating all its products to new token
standard
and uh
the most part is finished already so
especially the part concerning the
blockchain
smart contracts
liquidity
and all of this stuff
so uh now it is a
stage where we
uh upgrade our front ends and uh also
uh
test all the stuffs are only
uh so and
i have seen certain uh activity in chats
people
start panicking so please don't panic
so you remember this from the
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy so
you need a towel and uh you always need
to remember don't panic
never
uh so actually what's going on um so we
are testing everything so that's why we
are not stopping
the farms yet so but uh definitely we
will announce uh
in advance uh when we are going to stop
that
but uh this will not happen uh earlier
then we have the new dex front-end
deployed
so all of this is just
first for the safety of your funds and
for
convenience
of the transfer because
the process of
moving is extremely easy so you need
just to take your funds out of the decks
go to the next new decks uh you will get
the window saying that you can upgrade
your tokens and you upgrade the tokens
and do everything in reverse order
that's it so it's very easy
uh and for uh custom tokens that are not
issued
by our products
so we will we are preparing the
instructions most of the instructions
are already in place uh so and we will
be definitely publishing them
at the right
so just please please have an eye
on our groups and
channels
so we will inform you
at the right moment what you need to do
uh no worries absolutely it should be
about
the
[Music]
mythical uh permanent laws that that may
happen due to immigration this is not
true this can happen only in case if
someone starts making some big exchanges
at this very moment but it's unlikely
because
we have warned
all
major
token holders that we must wait at least
until the end of the migration
and also uh once again so broxis will
stay stand with its own liquidity in old
pools uh liquidity pools and farming
pools until the very end and
until all the people degrade just to
help stabilize the exchange rates and
help to avoid the potential
permanent laws
so just please please stay calm and
don't panic
uh so everything
goes as planned so
there is a slight delay uh on the
publication of new version of ever
wallet to the chrome store
so we are expecting it hopefully today
and guys
i hope we'll finish all the tests also
today
so and if everything goes as planned so
already tomorrow we can start uh
publishing all the instructions and
announce all the migration
of liquidity opened
uh there's also
some teaser that
our major products the bridge and the
swap will receive new names following
the rebranding process of error scale
and also we had
a strategy session
[Music]
a couple of weeks ago
where we have chosen uh
a great new names and so we for
over those in those two weeks so we were
checking all the trademarks you know and
uh the mains availability we were
preparing
uh all the social groups and whatever
so and uh
uh i hope that we will be able also to
announce the new names this week uh
but but no promises
uh so now
uh yeah so uh now now we have a hell
amount of work to update all of our
guides and
move them to new domains and so
that's not easy so
the team is working uh all week just to
structure everything and make all the
documentation and tutorials uh much more
into much better interlinked and
in general we really aiming to
radically improve the quality of the
documentation and
support materials for our products
so it if you miss something in our
current guidelines whatever so please
don't hesitate to
say this in chat so because we are
collecting all the feedback and
definitely to help us to prioritize
um yeah so uh
this is about the tips three one
migration and uh
this uh this migration will also unlock
a lot of
further development for us
because we were waiting for it uh to
happen
and uh
let me maybe
shortly say her was about what we are
going to do in this this year so
you may have already read
uh
our
roadmap yes so this is the first time we
publicly announced it
and
there are some great ideas that
we really believe
will be
bringing a lot of value to the whole
network
so speaking about bridge of course
which is our flagship product so this uh
not only support of new chains and uh
new tokens uh first of all we will have
the much
more facilitated token list mechanism
so we it's not in place yet but we're
only
making its architecture and thinking
about this but uh definitely this year
it will appear
all for the sake of
much
faster boarding of new projects
next is
the thing that is called unchained
reputation which is can work really
in line with development of ssi
frameworks on everscale and this is
something
you may have
seen in different analytical reports
saying that
dows
should
now function in a different way so not
only by the amount of your state but
rather on your involvement uh based on
your involvement and reputation in in
managing dows
and uh
this this is something we have in our
minds and
uh our guys already proposed uh some
mechanisms on how this unchained
reputation can be
implemented based uh on your activity in
other downs
uh so and
once
we describe it
and be ready to publish so i think that
it deserves
really
a separate
presentation of the call
also one one more non-trivial feature of
the bridge is that uh
all the layers nodes uh they keep uh
they serve the well full nodes actually
for blockchains that are connected to
them and uh such um
data set
can be used to provide uh some data
to to the blockchain to any connected
blockchain actually so and
this means that the bridge can become
itself a very very very strong oracle so
and this is something we really
were liking especially in the device
segment but also this is something uh
that can
be proposed to to other protocols
uh and uh last but not least is a nft
breach so the song long waited uh so and
we
actually have discussed with several
teams already on how they envision this
nft transfer between different chains
this is not a very easy task
because you need to think about
different
situations different use cases
uh
of transferring nfts
based on where the content is stored or
how the nfd is structured but
all of this uh really uh
currently is blocked by the uniform nft
standard pretty much like for the
fungible tokens what we have now
so we
are hoping that by end of february some
of the major uh nfc developers so they
will agree on certain standards
so that can be used just to integrate
into the bridge as well
uh speaking about the swap uh the the
major update it will receive this year
uh is its own token and
the dow so that will be
managing the basic parameters of
of the swap
including uh
curves uh including uh
fees for
for different kinds of polls including
different updates and so on so forth
but also uh
this means that
the the the decks will get much more
diversity in terms of uh and
possibilities in terms of exchange uh we
were thinking also about a kind of
otc or p2p
mechanism
for a decentralized exchange so with a
really
low or
totally no slippage
uh so but
there is no still
strong position on how to do this and
also uh
as we are waiting for the appearance of
landing protocols uh in every scale
network so
uh hopefully we will be able able to
also offer some marginal trading
uh so speaking about the error wallet uh
quite a lot
will appear there and the major things
that we were
asked
so many times i cannot even count so
this is the collectibles so you can
finally see your nfts in the wallet yay
so this is something
that exists in metamask for for a long
period of time already
so and uh it will appear here as well so
and
once we
uh get the uniform cnft standard
also a good thing uh it's a good
announcement that finally finally we've
got a lsql application in ledger life so
it is still
in the developer mode so if you are
willing to test it so please just turn
the developer mode on you will see the
error scale app
and now we are doing the security audit
so that is required to publish the
application
in production
so and this is really crucial because
most of the institutional investors they
prefer hardware wallets to store their
keys
and uh
in fact we have the support for ledger
uh
for more than a year with
decathlon so and hopefully we will be
able to use it in our wallet finally
uh so as soon as this
is publicly available
uh also what we uh would like to improve
uh in uh ever wallet is so we we get a
lot of uh
good really good feedback from from our
users uh concerning ux ui
of the wallet and we are carefully
listening to it so
some things definitely will change
making the wallet even better and this
concerts not only the
ui part for users but it will also
concern
the
interfaces for developers so making uh
it's much easier to connect the
transport to your dm
uh
also uh one more thing that is also long
awaited by the community is a custom
token lists so this will be something we
will add both to the error wallet and to
to the swap
and this thing this
custom token list will be managed
by different
[Music]
groups and reputable organizations so
so there will be definitely a community
list that will be managed
in the everscale repo
so uh and
to add your tokens there you will need
to make the pull requests there so as
usual
and there will be also uh some lists
managed for example by uh
kwpc so who as we discussed uh some time
ago that probably some tokens of the
projects that will be launching on flags
will also appear on
on our swap
and just to make
it possible for users to see this token
so there will be a custom token list
that will be
doing this and that will manage
basically the pc team
and a lot of other stuff so i will not
read out all the roadmaps so if you're
interested so uh
please go to to our medium so there is a
good article explaining and everything
in detail so just not consider it out
your time
i just decided to name a few things that
i personally think are the most crucial
ones
and um
these things
really really matter a lot for us and
for for the team because we
really
do care about the products we we do and
we really want to hear your feedback as
well
um
yeah so uh this is about
the roadmap
uh um sergey uh wants to say a few words
so so he had some ideas on how we can uh
make the the scale governance even
better so sergey please
i think he uh i think he may have uh
left
so
that's okay
okay so uh i i will just maybe uh in
this case uh jesus
so so uh
defy alliance uh is now preparing an
additional um
proposal for some uh things that can
help us make the blockchain governance
even better
and uh
so hopefully we will release it this
week
yeah so and
you may have heard about some points uh
at the
russian ama session
that we hosted uh last week
uh together with sergey
uh so uh but also of course we'll
publish it officially
[Music]
on the forum
probably we will host another english
ams session this week so we just have
not decided on the time yet
on thursday on friday so please
keep an eye on on our groups
so
yeah
i think uh that's all the major updates
and
i hope you don't forget
too many information in my head
it's a lot of information but uh uh it
it's kind of like a
you know if a movie lasts for three
hours but it's the godfather
you don't miss a beat it's something you
want to listen to so that is a lot of
information to digest but it's a lot of
very very useful and good information i
didn't even have a chance to write down
the questions that i had but i'll i'll
ask that individually ldm you like okay
fantastic by the way uh um i absolutely
empathize with your uh rebranding
situation you're not alone my friend
there's a lot of that going on
yes it's a pain it but but it's a good
pain you know so this is something i
don't know about poor forwards yeah i
don't know about that but okay
thank you vlad thank you very much does
anybody have a question
yeah
excellent thank you so much
all right i think um uh normally we'd
have our closing segment ben spitz but
then um he wrote in the uh zoom chat um
he's not with us today he has a very
important appointment that he has to
attend to so we're going to skip that
and see him next week
and i think we could just go and write
to questions so let's let's start with
youtube there's only uh well there's two
one and a half um
what about rust cut prices mita uh
somebody asks hey everybody what about
rust cup prices i
i don't know exactly what um that means
but maybe you do that's uh yeah i do
that we're waiting for uh as i said the
plan is to to release uh dark pools as
an intermediate um kind of solution for
that
which uh i commented on the beginning
the status
and uh that's that then the decision of
the governments when and how it in
practice will be
kind of distributed we're building the
tools so
the tools
already now on the front end is missing
and uh if you want to build a front end
by the way you're welcome to do so we
will release the interfaces to the
contracts
and uh so you can do that
um
other than that we're building the
electric smart contract as as a plan
goes and uh
once it has been developed and validated
verified
uh we're going to replace the
electrosmart contract with the delector
smart contracts it's a big big big
change actually in terms of like the
whole architecture of everything
and then because that will deprecate
electro and it will deprecate the pulse
as well
so it's a it's a huge change to
to the to the kind of
underlying
blockchain infrastructure in terms of
staking
yeah it's a very good change as well
so um
no more elections
and stuff like that no more stress to
the network
liquidity fuel everything supported and
one that's like a
huge
underlying technology for all the defy
infrastructure as well
important so yeah but um and it's
simplification actually
believe it or not
so as every good design
should actually simplify things so yeah
but but before it's done then there is
an intermediate solution
that's it basically
okay thank you
um and uh the second question i think
it's been partially answered but i'll
ask it for the sake of announcing it uh
will there be a separate q a session for
the ever slash never monetary system
um glad we can we can do that at any
time yeah so i think that we will uh
have discussion about this on thursday
on the defy sub governance call so if
you're interested please please come and
feel free to ask questions
there you go yeah all right
we can do the separate session
afterwards if you if you if the
community feels it's necessary it's not
the problem again there is a there is a
published
design of that for a year already
so
it's like um
[Music]
it's very simple system so actually not
nothing too complicated to compare it to
what media is doing
right now with the network
no it's not very it's not too simple
system because it's still there there
are degree auctions there there is there
are some subsystems yeah but
the concept itself is really easy to
understand
yeah it should be easy i would say this
way yes i have already
for me what what i consider easy
sometimes than
[Music]
just people coming to me and saying oh
it's very complicated okay
it's because you're a rockstar media not
everybody doesn't braxton i don't think
because of that but anyway let's keep
this point
right we have uh we have a few questions
that were written to us um so let me
sort of run through these really quickly
and then we can we can uh disperse uh
the first question is how is the project
with uh uh the company kamaz going um
the answer to that is that uh we're
they're expecting a mvp in march that's
not set in stone but that's the
that's the uh protracted goal
um
can you please uh share any news
regarding the contest uh for the
development of a voting solution with
uh zero knowledge proofs yes i can
um and i will
paraphrase it um now so
um
so there's good news um the
uh voting protocol implementation
contest is finished um
no foundation uh presented a vote say uh
what's called vote saver protocol which
basically and they had an ama by the way
about it which you can find uh in the
chats
there was a two week long
q a discussion between the judges
uh and it pretty much got settled within
the sub governance chat itself
uh
the
jurors pretty much got their questions
resolved and the result is that there's
now a mass scale
voting
setup
that can preserve voter privacy
now the next thing is they're awaiting a
good ui ux
and they are waiting for our first use
case
that's that's the hard part as always
right so um
voting uh something like this is a major
major
undertaking it's not uh you know a meme
or
something like that it's very
complicated uh but
i'd like to note that um eugene morozev
is heavily pushing a use case in the
united states
through the american blockchain pack pac
which uh basically means uh uh
political um
uh
action committee right i believe that's
what pac means yeah it's like super pac
it's a political action committee so who
knows maybe that that'll be our first
use case maybe something else but
essentially it's
um
it's moved quite a bit so there's an
actual solution out there um we have uh
another question uh give me a sec here
so
right so regarding the same contest why
were there only two submissions
um i don't know
uh because the only two people only two
teams were were able to make submissions
this is not an easy contest
uh i mean you're literally
you know changing uh
like miti likes to say you're changing
paradigms you're changing the way uh
voting works this is um
you know
this isn't uh you know uh
as easy as uh you know uh
making uh
postcards or something this is a this is
complicated work and uh the follow-up
question of that is uh uh the contest
guarantees one million evers to the
winner well i mean um ask yourself what
would a i don't know a major world
government uh dish out
if they were
a good world government uh for changing
voting protocols how much money would
they put on to something like this
billions of dollars i mean i think uh
not only is it fair i think it's um
if there's a solution that actually
works and gets implemented
by golly it's uh it's cheap
cheapest ever the history of mankind so
um i think that's
i hope that answers your question and
one final question
um
which team will make the lending
protocol for the road map um
lending isn't to lend money i'm assuming
nothing
yes yes yes yeah who's gonna
keep an eye just on you so i'm not sure
if i can disclose the team
so but
if
the guys want so they will present the
works themselves
so uh for some reason so uh we didn't
manage actually in the different device
of governance because there were not so
many submissions
and not so many interests
for doing this although this is
something
i personally believe a
really interesting and challenging topic
of making the
credit protocols uh on blockchain uh
because
i used to do something similar in past
and it's it's extremely
interesting and there's a lot of
very fancy mass
and
other stuff but
hopefully they will make the
announcements
not sure about terms but i hope that it
will happen this
month
okay
well
as i said only two presentations but
a lot of information to digest um so
with that uh last call for your comments
three
two
one have a wonderful rest of your week
have a wonderful weekend we will see you
on tuesday we already have some stuff
lined up maybe as we discussed earlier
with michael gourd maybe we'll have some
some interesting project winners coming
to speak about what they're going to do
with
the everscale startup competition so
thank you very much for coming
goodbye
thanks all bye bye cheers
