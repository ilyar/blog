we got some problems i think with
synchronization uh like around i think

764
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
synchronization uh like around i think
 

765
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,949
synchronization uh like around i think
the last time he got some problems with

766
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:52,959
the last time he got some problems with
 

767

subscription marketplace so the first
 

1303
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,269
subscription marketplace so the first
thing is the protocol which um

1304
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:29,279
thing is the protocol which um
 

1305
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,230
thing is the protocol which um
using

1306
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,240
using
 

1307
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,549
