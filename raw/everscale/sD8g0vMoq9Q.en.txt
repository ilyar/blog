star is a
almost
four almost four years ago before coffee
uh
happy to join with you here
and hope so
uh
good impact for us indonesia because
it's indonesia
looking something
new business new
digital era
and
we thank you guys
for coming to
this event thank you
hello everyone
my name is irfantis nabody i'm the
indonesia representative for
coinstore.com
which is a a
top 20 crypto exchange on coin gecko
we specialize in
new project listings
so
usually projects come to us
for their first time listing and
we help them
develop from the grassroots level help
build help build their community
increase liquidity for trading volume so
that
they will grow and list on the bigger
tier exchanges
thank you
hi everyone
uh privet and thanks so much to the
everscale team for for having us my name
is fuzz uh my background is in venture
capital and uh policy so i used i used
to work for a venture fund and
the malaysian government at one point so
right now our venture group we invest in
compliant first uh crypto businesses
so formally i'm ceo of mx global we're a
regulated uh exchange in malaysia and
then we also have investments across the
region southeast asia we partner with
binance to build compliant first
regulator exchanges and we also
partnered with the chinese government to
build inter-operation blockchains
because i'm sure you all know like china
has banned all cryptocurrencies so i
think the policy decisions of many
countries will affect not just
like my market malaysia but also huge
markets like indonesia where china is a
big trading partner

started about three years ago and
currently we are working with
financial institutions
exchanges
so that to bring um a more secure and
faster um transactions
and we built our uh network on balance
binance smart uh chain and xdi and
osomatic
yeah thank you okay guys thank you for
introduction uh
and uh we want to know about the nearest
future uh in indonesia regulation
and
view indonesia become a crypto heaven
because here in indonesia in bali very
strong crypto community a very strong
crypto network and what do you think
about it start from
yeah uh i think so
in asia
indonesia is one of the
largest countries adopt is a new
regulation related to the blockchains
and
we are lucky have a good president mr
joko widodo
we are they fully support
us is uh
to
make as a
blockchains
to be adopted is not only as
as of assets and then
the government
have a planning to adopt blockchains
to implement
to in all the regulation
because is uh when i've discussed like a
with bob empty is a pop-empty is a
one of the
regulators for the digital asset traders
and
they fully support and we are now
already regulated
and as long there is a
you
as registered your company
your assets and a hundred percent is uh
the government
will endorse you as a digital asset
yeah
yeah when it comes to regulations um in
indonesia regarding crypto assets i
think we can divide it into uh two parts
first
uh
the creation of digital assets right and
the second is the trading of digital
assets so if you are a uh project
builder and you're building a crypto
asset
uh in indonesia it's still pretty much a
wild west because there's no regulation
right so anyone can create a crypto
asset
but on the other hand
if you're an exchange and you're
enabling the buying and selling of
digital assets that's a very uh
regulated field
right so um the activities of these
crypto exchanges are um
are very regulated
um as a company you would have there's a
minimum deposit of capital that you have
to uh you have to deposit in order to
establish a legal entity as a crypto
exchange here
um and then
uh
if
if you're building a crypto asset uh the
commodities regulator uh so crypto
assets are considered commodities here
right so you're asking about um whether
or not it's it's going to be used as
payment i think that's still a long way
to go so cryptos are commodities here
and uh the commodities regulator
uh if you're building a crypto asset
they uh they would advise you to test
your grounds first in international
markets first so
um the best thing to do is you would
have to list on an international market
first
like it's it's a very
um
very selective field when you're trying
to list a crypto asset in a
uh an exchange that is registered here
in indonesia
um
but the commodities regulator has a
white list so they
determine there there's about 229 crypto
projects that are allowed to be listed
by the exchanges
um if you're not in these white lists uh
they refer to coin market cap and these
aggregators uh to make the white list
if you're not in
the white list
you can hire
independent auditors
to audit your projects so they would
audit your how much user base you have
your technology
and
these auditors will defend your case to
the commodities regulator
and say that even though this project is
not in part the white list but it
deserves to be listed because of so and
so reasons
uh yeah
uh yeah so i think if you look at what
airfarm was saying just now you have
about 13 uh regulated exchanges in in
indonesia
um they're registered and permissioned
to operate but beyond that i'll just
have a chat with iran before this like
there's 200 registered
exchanges right so i the key thing to
kind of bear in mind is like regulations
develop slightly differently from market
to market country to country so their
continues to evolve
so what does it mean to be one of the 20
registered and one of the 13 regulated
or you know ones so
what we see is for example and i think
for the audience here you know many of
us are not indonesian based in indonesia
maybe you don't have a key task maybe
you don't have
maybe you don't have a bank account
so some of these exchanges the 13 allow
you to onboard as a foreign individual
investor
some of them don't so what is and this
is not something unique to indonesia
many markets have
what i would call like fluid regulations
so it is up to the exchanges to kind of
come up with the policies to be able to
satisfy the regulators
and
i think for many of us who are probably
in this room working on projects
the fact that crypto is categorized as a
commodity in indonesia is probably
something fairly interesting because
there are different
laws and prescriptions to that
as opposed to other markets where
they're treated as securities
so
my general advice and our experience so
far has been you should work closely
with the with an exchange here because
they are typically the ones that
interface a lot with bubble pepti so
that you can know whether your project
has to be in the regulated space or it
can remain unregulated for like for for
example daos and nfts are largely not
regulated in indonesia and so that's a
it's an unclear treatment but i guess to
the benefit of the industry right you
can still do how you want to do it until
a future point where they have clearer
regulations
yeah i'm actually um
when it comes to regulations and
the crypto space
as as an entrepreneur
sometimes you
have this
sense of okay let's just go ahead and
build it and do it
while in hot pursuit of the regulators
so they will be very closely watching
but in some instances i feel
that
that growth needs to occur
before the regulators
are aware of what
regulations they need to put in place
so sometimes you need that
spark and you need that guts
and risk taking to
build and cultivate new products and
services that perhaps are not yet
regulated here
in order to bring the issue to light for
the regulators to come in and
provide some governance
yeah yeah i agree with that uh basically
regulators have to come in uh place in
this in this scene
basically
um as you you all know that
the government is actually creating the
official exchanges that will
um aggregate all of other exchanges uh i
think there are 17 exchanges in
indonesia
and
yeah speaking of blockchain i think uh
well
we we have um
a joint venture between the government
uh mdi telecom and also and binance i
think that's a that's a good sign for
indonesia especially
uh when we when we talk about crypto
right it's more than just transactions
crypto and blockchains more than just
transactions i think
smart contracts and dows can play a very
big uh
um
are very strong in this area
in this industry especially in
our healthcare government educations
payments
travel and everything
well we can see that in indonesia
there are about new close close to 300
million populations uh 276 to be exact
and 60 of them are actually
uh genji and millennials so basically
they are
people under 40 40 years old and the
potential is huge
and i think in the future
web3 will be
will be very important part
in in this industry basically it's about
empowerment it's about giving back to
the people it's about giving back to the
community right
and um well i think a combination of
web3 and green energy will be uh we
should look look out that that will be
the the next big thing in blockchain i
think uh give providing rewards to
people who are actually creating an
impact to the to the world giving back
to the people empowering people
um
giving uh well well it's it's a is the
next i think that's the next green
economies for indonesia especially
okay thank you
many times
i heard uh gossips about national
stablecoin
can you
tell us
when uh
will lounge and national stable going
who will make it maybe you heard about
it
can you tell us something about
yeah as a a stable coin is a one of the
or promising in the future
uh
because it's a
okay indonesia is a very unique country
and then
we a lot of priority investor
if you uh read is a
last year is a cnbc report
for five months is a government claim
25.8 billion u.s dollar
just investor from indonesia
most of them they interested
to the stable coin
because is uh the pension fund
and also insurance
company that goes to the stable coin
and then there's a
the government right now
thinking how
in the future
the local currency
will pledge
to the stable coin
yes this is a needed time it's not
simple but
the point is as a government
thinking which is the good things for
them for us i mean
and then these uh
they will launching after they
make sure that everything has a good
impact for the government
yeah that's that's that's the condition
and then this last time is our
discussion with the government as well
yeah
um when it comes to stable coins i think
uh we still have a long way to go before
it can be implemented here in indonesia
for the uh sole reason that
crypto itself is a commodities right so
it's treated and it's being regulated in
the same way as other commodities
such as gold
oil soybeans and so on
well
the main purpose of cbdc is for payment
right
i've heard several initiatives of
a cbdc project
being attempted
by our central bank so
um that's also a different
regulatory entity
compared to the entity that regulates
crypto which is uh bapti the commodities
regulator
um i think it's still yeah i think it's
still a long way to go and i've heard
several
initiatives of creating a rupiah cbdc
and uh it's it's it
it never seemed to gain any traction
so
and we already have a lot of payment
gateways that are uh already integrated
with various crypto exchanges so users
can easily convert their crypto assets
into rupiah in their bank account anyway
right um i think there's also another
exchange called zipmex that has created
a
a visa
debit card so people can use the crypto
assets in exchange for everyday payments
so
i would have to say now um yeah still
long way to go and it's not uh it's not
an urgent thing i think it will become
more urgent as more and more uh of
indonesia's trade partners
um kind of enforce the use of
stable coins for
for everyday trades and export import
yeah um
i think there's a distinction between
cbdc's and stable coins right they sell
different purposes and obviously the
authority that governs them are
different in indonesia they already have
a few private stablecoin projects like
idi idea rt
um
but i i think as a panelist has shared a
lot of
the larger
ticket size investors typically will buy
stablecoin first and i think this is
where we need to make a distinction of
like why they're buying stable coins
they're not buying it because they want
to keep it in usdt or idrt or just a
stablecoin i mean even with base landing
rates
and and savings rates of banks that one
is going to grow faster in fiat than it
is going to go in in a stable coin so
it's because stable coins are the
natural on-ramp that they need right
after they remove themselves from fiat
rupiah fiat
to be able to then buy other
cryptocurrencies
but for a country like indonesia the
concern around building a stable coin is
very different than a country like the
us
where the u.s has a very open and
internationally traded
fiat currency the u.s dollar
currencies like the rupiah or the
malaysian ringgate or filipino peso are
typically what's considered as
restricted currencies right the
surrounding monetary policy of these
countries are such that they want to
minimize capital flight
so a lot more of the rupiah should be
spent on shore in indonesia and as
everyone just touched on this now
many of the things to do with how can
you spend your rupiah in crypto it's
already you know fairly well served with
on-ramps with payment gateways and and
of course like some innovations like
spending it through your card so i find
it quite hard for a government to um to
introduce a cbdc that has more value add
than i think some of the utility that
some stable coins can already do
the the consideration for a country to
really open up the currency through a
cbdc
probably has much more risk than what's
obvious to us when we're in web 3 and
crypto right it's it's really around
monetary expansion policies and these
are
fairly difficult conversations that they
have on the national and international
level
that i'm not sure that the interest of
the crypto industry itself is enough to
kind of push a country with a research
restricted currency like indonesia to
have to do a cbdc urgently
yeah i'm not i'm not an expert on
stablecoin but um
[Music]
you know just as a consumer you would
think that
um
considering the issues that fauzi
mentioned can be addressed
as long as
well for one it would enable the
the centralized parties to to have their
skin in the game a little bit more but
then you need to have uh the rest of the
ecosystem upgrade as well
i don't think the introduction of a
stablecoin as is will do much uh for the
economy
but if it uh if it was introduced and
all the
uh derivative
products and and infrastructure is also
upgraded such as
uh payment processing and uh payment
acceptance
you know in retail
i think then
it would be worth considering
yep agree with uh fawzi as he mentioned
about the issues in indonesia for stable
coins and also cbdc's i think like
aditya said that it needs to be there
needs to be an ecosystem to upgrade to
upgrade the ecosystem hopefully every
scale can can help the government and
also the players here in indonesia but
uh from my point of view i think stable
points and cbdc's are totally different
thing i think even though they are
both stable i think for stable coins
basically they need a liquidity provider
they need to have
a market maker they can you know
turn that
coin into fiat and i think for cbdc
well the central bank is actually
looking towards that and they are
planning to to create a cbdc looking at
china's abdc's eun i think indonesia is
planning on that well
what they need is basically a partner a
technology partner maybe hopefully every
skill can provide that to indonesian
government and the regulators
that's my that's what i think okay guys
so thank you for your opinion and this
is the most interesting question for me
and i think for our audience because a
lot of investors here about indonesian
private equity funds
how do they think about crypt
how much part of their portfolio encrypt
and
about return of investment
how many percent way promise to
their client do you know something about
it because it's very interesting
topic for us
yeah
[Music]
some people say it is a the worst
scenario the worst condition is not
always
be
the worst situation
we are lucky actually is uh
during the pandemic
almost
three years
indonesia one of the
largest countries in asia we can survive
because we're changing rapidly
from the
what we call it is a
menu
program everything standard and then we
goes to the digital
and
we
look in the future
is uh now
everything goes to the digitalized
and the government fully support
doing
uh very regulated and then the
government also
spent a lot of money
for example for a
small medium enterprise
and then is uh
they
do the scale scale scalability to to to
support
uh
what we call the economy and which is is
uh
i think so
we are the
when you see the report is about last
year
uh
our inflation is one of the lowest in in
in in work or in asia
and then so that's mean is uh
the pandemic is not always
be a bad thing
and a lot of
coming is a good things you know for
example gojek is a
before pandemic
they
make money is around about 2 billion but
after pandemic is a they create a lot of
is a business a lot of his opportunity
is almost five to seven billion u.s
dollar is very tremendous i think so is
uh
uh this is uh
the lucky one for us
is uh it's not only go check it grab and
offer a lot of things
and
yeah his good market is up especially
for like everscale
when they develop is a new technology
and then
looking at the market in indonesia
uh is a good thing for for for for us in
the future yeah that's that's i i saw in
the future very promising
um i have not seen
um
much
uh interest from
um indonesian fund companies to really
allocate the portfolio in crypto what's
usually happening is uh you know these
fun companies um their founders
have kids right in their teenage years
maybe they're in college
uh
their children uh dabbles in crypto
invest in nfds
um
but i think
what would be a game changer maybe in
the next uh one to two years
is actually the initiative of uh
babti the commodities regulator
to establish um a clearing exchange
so
how this clearing exchange works is uh
it would become
the liquidity insurer for the 18 crypto
exchanges that is registered
um so
these uh 18 crypto exchanges they have
to
deposit i think 70 of their liquidity
each of them into the clearing exchange
and this clearing exchange will become
an insurer in case one of these
exchanges go to fault
um i think
with that initiative um i think more and
more uh traditional fund companies will
uh allocate more and
more of their portfolio into crypto
especially uh the blue chips uh bitcoin
ethereum
i think um
they're i'm seeing a lot of initiatives
as well from crypto communities
to
um educate uh their members
about how bitcoin is basically a digital
gold right it's it
it um it can be considered a safe haven
uh asset for longer term
um yeah that that could happen uh in the
next one or two years as it becomes more
insured by the government and more
regulated
yeah um
i mean i have a little bit of experience
in vc and pe right uh i was i've been in
that space since like 2011
and it's kind of funny that in 2022 we
talk about crypto vcs as if these tech
companies which are building in web 3
and crypto are like typical
tech companies because they're not right
you know in the tradit i guess if you
call it the traditional vc space you
have your precede seat series a b all
goes up towards an ipo or some sort of
acquisition
whereas in crypto you have you can have
in many cases immediate or fairly
short-term
um horizon to ultimately liquidity right
especially to a crypto to crypto market
so
if you look back in like 2016 2017
nobody was talking about early stage
incubators or vc funds and all that
everyone's like you know go to market
ico and of course many things have
happened from there i'm sure
i'm also a recovering dj so i've
probably also lost a bit of money in the
2016-2017
ico boom but my point being like the
rules of the game don't have to be the
same as how you have with your tradition
i guess you call it relatively
traditional tech growth strategies
so
when you take that into account
the question that everybody asks like
how much of a pe or vc portfolio of
funds allocating into crypto i think the
natural answer should be zero percent
because they don't have to play by the
same rules
you look at the terms of a typical vc
fund right it's an eight-year lock-up if
you're a limited partner and you give my
vc fund like 10 million dollars you'll
never see that back for eight years if i
use a model like european waterfall
you'll never see it back until i recover
the capital but in crypto if you can go
to um you know maybe um
different exchanges and you have
liquidity there why would i want to wait
eight years before you give me my
returns right why why can't i get the
capital appreciation when you give me
back the tokens that you've invested my
money in and then i can offload that in
the market whenever i want so the rules
of the games have have really changed
now
when you look from a data point of view
of how much has it has grown so of
course 2021 and 2022 is still a bit too
early for us to look at the data but
2019 to
2020 the average size of a crypto fund
right the ones who call themselves kind
of like uh specific boutique funds went
from uh 12 million
us dollars to 45 million us dollars
average size
um
and of course now in 2022 you can expect
probably a lot more
but when you look at who's investing
into these funds
you'll be very hard pressed to find
large institutional investors maybe
they're investing in like soft bank fund
two these big funds but for a lot of the
smaller funds which are focused
the sixty percent of the investors are
high net worth individuals the other
thirty plus percent are family officers
so basically the same thing it's just
rich families or family offices putting
money in into structured funds and very
little participation from from
institutional i agree with your fund i
think the staff things like a
centralized exchange or a national
exchange making something like what you
see in chicago with the cme
that's probably going to be the on-ramp
for a lot of institutional funds
primarily because their mandate and
their trading strategies are cannot be
as wild west as kind of a smaller uh
family officers so really the questions
i think that we have to ask ourselves is
like not really should there be a vc or
not but what are the new terms of this
crypto vc style investment that should
be and if i'm an lp i don't want to do
an eight year tie up you know maybe i do
a
a a one-year one-year cliff and after
that i can sell whatever i put into the
fund
so i i think the model of a vc in crypto
has to be very different and
i in closing i'd say that
if this happens whichever way indonesia
will undoubtedly be probably the first
market in southeast asia to receive you
know a lot of this investment we saw
that in web 2. um you know as our
parents also shared like you know you
have big companies like docopedia gojek
they're all here because the reality is
for a foreign investor and we saw this
happen when the web 2 money from the us
and japan came right
there they're from new york or silicon
valley or tokyo they look at southeast
asia as like one one area and they say
where should we start well let's start
with the biggest one which is like half
the population is in this one country
indonesia and there's a lot of corporate
participation from the investments so we
start with indonesia it's actually
i mean when i was in the vc space we
complained about this all the time and
said why is everyone going to indonesia
because there's other opportunities in
other markets no it's actually very
simple it's like i have to invest money
into this area and where do i start i
start from the biggest piece of the pie
which is indonesia so i think it'll be a
very interesting space and i agree with
irfan i don't think it's going to be led
by the grandfather and father generation
of this multi-generational family
businesses it's going to be their sons
and their grandchildren who are now
buying crypto and their degens
themselves the other guys are going to
say hey let's take a hundred million
dollars and and throw it at uh at ever
right and let's get that
listed in the exchanges here and let's
let's uh write the the upside of the
appreciation that's
in my opinion really how it's going to
play out it's not going to play out like
a traditional financial market
uh sure i think that's kind of a trick
question because
if you take a look at the state of uh
web 3 as it is now and
just the way projects are getting
launched the kind of projects that are
getting launched how they're raising
funds
uh who they're selling to
at the end of the day it's it's a little
bit of a trick question because why
would i and no offense to any of the vcs
that are here but
unless you're offering a very very
unique strategic partnership advantage
then why not raise directly from the
consumers that you intend to sell to
um
that's that's that's what we're able to
do these days through through web 3
through nft um
yeah i think that's my answer
cool well i'm i'm i'm a vc myself i
have a venture fund that focus on
green green impact basically we invest
in startups that actually um
the impact warriors well speaking of
traditional vcs that invest in the
crypto space i've seen a few of my
friends in singapore we have east
ventures we have uh golden golden gate
ventures that they actually have a
specific crypto fund that actually
invests in
uh blockchain products
but however i think the problem is that
there is not enough utility in this in
this space that's i think why webtree is
again very important because web3 is
about
it's about utility right basically on
how you can basically create a project
on top of blockchain and rewards other
people's peoples who are actually
engaging in your project projects and i
think um
the next thing is is the ssi is digital
identity basically and that's how i
think well the problem indonesia is that
80 of indonesians are under bank
actually under bank meaning they have
money they have income but they are not
able to
obtain loans or
financing from financial institutions
because why because they don't have
credit credit good credit
um
well because we don't have a good credit
scoring company here indonesia it's all
done by the central bank i think that's
how in the future hopefully
digital identity such as ssi will come
in web 3 will come in
and that's how i think um
well
the venture capitals fund will be useful
when
more players are actually building
projects on top of blockchain
that's what i think okay guys
thank you for your answers and the last
question for today
we need
a little your vision and your experience
because we want to know
what areas
will be changed but
by blockchain in five years in indonesia
maybe it's
new metabolism it's a green energy maybe
maybe something other what do you think
about
yeah green energy uh
i think so everybody is a agree with us
here
uh
ten years ago the
our previous president missed
what it called
they
claim we are looking 35 000
megawatts
and
at the time
the regulation they goes to the vozil
and
after
a new president mr jokovidoro and they
changed the regulation
now
we focusing to the new
uh green energy
what we are looking for actually is a
like a
sun
wind and what we call water and a lot of
now is uh investor coming to indonesia
discuss with the government
how they're going to solve the problem
change from the vosel goes to the green
energy
and
yeah
the parliament also very supports
our government to change the condition
because is uh indonesia already signed
is a green energy
and
this is also
one of the big projects for the
government
and in the future
when we are talking is about population
we are now is the number five in the
world
274 million people and then we are
increased almost is up uh three to five
percent per year
and can you imagine so how big the
capacity for the future
for example is our one of my hometown in
in rio and pecambaro
now they a lot of a lot of is set up is
uh what it called is a
sun energy and then they combine
together with water is very
fantastic and they can
reduce almost 60 to 80 percent
the cost
what they
spend uh
vertical is a monthly
and so
almost
that area now is a change
of cancel the oracle the contract with
the
national electricity pln
and
it's not only pizza public is a very
attractive for our government and also
the government uh have a special rules
and give is an incentive to all the
investor to all the vertical is a
developer is for the green energy and
they get a lot of benefit in the future
yeah
next five years
we've had uh an exponential growth uh
for the last two years um in indonesia
uh i think by the end of 2020 uh the
total
user base for all crypto exchanges
indonesia uh was no more than five
million
uh it's now in the tens of millions so
that in itself is already uh an
exponential growth now for the next five
years i think the big question is um how
do we onboard the next
50 million indonesians let's say
right um i think several things come to
mind in order to make that happen
user friendliness
better user experience
in all crypto related adapts
also
as the
sector itself becomes more regulated um
i think more and more exchanges and uh
product uh product builders will uh try
to come up ways in order to make um
investing and storing your crypto assets
uh safer and easier
i know there is a friend of mine who's
building a crypto exchange that
enables enables its users to have
self-custody descriptor assets in a very
uh easy and user-friendly way
also i think the play to earn sector i
think
will will be big in the next uh five
years or so in indonesia
uh i notice there is a trend uh when it
comes to
hot investing
um
in indonesia right
but a lot of these
investment products have turned out to
be
scams or ponzi schemes you know every
several years
these investments
they
are branded with different packages
right first
uh like 10 10 years back it was like
gold investment gold investment and then
afterwards
it's property investment and then our
most recent one is automated forex
trading like
they claim it's
uh
the
investors money are traded in the forex
market using robots it turns out um the
owners had control of the brokers
themselves so it was it was they end up
uh all of them being ponzi schemes all
along
uh i think the
next sector will be play to earn play to
earn
um i've already seen a lot of my friends
who were involved in those
and those bad investments are they're
they're building
newer and better uh pr uh products in
form of place to earn hopefully
uh it will be packaged in a more
sustainable way
have better
uh ponzinomics you would say right so uh
it would it
it would be a more viable investment
yeah next five years i think it's pretty
difficult for anyone to tell where it's
going to go i mean i think in this room
we couldn't even tell where bitcoin was
gonna go you know five months ago right
so um
in our opinion like the most important
builds
are going to be in the spaces which are
not sexy right you think indonesia for
example you guys are building a brand
new um capital city if you wanted to
integrate blockchain into and
technologies into a lot whether it's
energy consumption whether it's traffic
management and all that i mean those are
the most important places for you to
build
blockchain-based technologies around but
can you imagine listing something like
that on an exchange
you know like people just wouldn't
really get it
but i'm sure a lot of people in this
room are using steppen
but gmt right still can't believe that
gmt is somewhere like beyond 10 cents
but now like a couple of dollars and
every day they're walking around trying
to
mine um
the you know within the ecosystem so
it's actually a
fairly difficult dynamic to kind of
predict right on one hand
you need a lot of capital to kind of
roll out large
important blockchain use cases that will
long term improve your country but at
the same time there's a lot of hype in
this market so if you don't have
something cool sexy current that has an
app that has some stickiness
you can't keep the community and
ultimately the investor dollars within
that you know any system that doesn't
have that so
it's going to be fairly difficult uh to
to depend on just regulations to address
this uh you know as if one said like
yes there's there's lots of ponzi
schemes i think all over the world and
indonesia and markets in south asia are
not exempt from those but there are also
lots of legitimate blockchain projects
that maybe did manage to raise some
capital and it's just hard man like it's
super hard to build
a really good product right and then
they fail eventually but that doesn't
mean that they were ponzis
but yes
you know in the whole scheme of things i
believe ultimately the decision by by
governments will be to
to fund
the solutions that that they want
and i'm not sure that many governments
or any governments in the world
really
are 100 behind blockchain
right um so i think that's that's where
it's difficult
so my short term bet in the next three
five years is that play to earn you know
run to earn
like entertain to earn whatever all of
this to earn kind of ecosystems will do
very well
but i'm conflicted because personally i
don't think that that's the most
important things that we have to solve
right
so
i guess time will tell um and and
and i think in closing like
when we run an exchange and we talk to a
lot of investors we're the first time or
like you know multi-year investors in
crypto nobody ever asked like how does
the blockchain really work how does this
project really work everybody says hey
you know send me a signal right what do
you think is the price for bitcoin what
price should i buy in what what price
should i exit so i think that tells you
almost everything about really the hype
eventually in the market it's a very
financial market and people are in here
to make money
and that doesn't necessarily line up
with nation building or like solving the
world's problems you know in the long
run
i think um one of the biggest shifts
we're going to see in the next five
years especially in indonesia is
uh a surge in adoption because we're a
very creative country um art and culture
is a very big part of um of our culture
of our our our way of life
i mean if you take a look at
some of the top projects on openc a lot
of those projects come from indonesia
whether it's karafuru or
avariks or on one force
a lot of those people are from indonesia
and what nfts have done
um is
act as a gateway
in a sense uh for people who would not
otherwise
uh consider going into crypto
uh there are women who fell in love with
the art but was always too afraid to buy
ethereum
and suddenly she's in the game right
so i think in the next five years
there's going to be a lot of
trend revisiting some of the older
platforms that have existed and that
perhaps the west have enjoyed
and now
in the next five years
there will be more indonesians going to
enjoy those uh earlier platforms
yeah thank you
yeah i think for me
next f three to five years i think um
i'm pretty sure it will be
um anything got to do with
sustainability so going back again um i
think um
i think hopefully and and i'm actually
already seeing a few projects that are
actually building based on esg
environment social and governance
in fact a few of venture capitals in the
world have declared that they only
invest in startups or products that
supports esg
which is the one of the one of the
either it's for environment or social or
governance
and i think supporting the
united nations 17
u.n goals i think
it goes more than just climate is it it
has poverty it has gender equality you
know
renewables
a lot of these projects that actually
can can be built uh on on top of a block
blockchain so what i'm seeing is that
well in the next five years
i'm pretty sure more projects based on
esg will be built and uh well maybe in
the next five years we will have another
conference for everscale which is three
times bigger than this hopefully
in five years
seven years
in years yeah okay guys
thank you guys it was a brilliant
discussion so i really thank you
everyone for attention so now we are
wrapping up the first part of the
conference so and going to the lunch uh
so we will continue at 2
15.
we will continue at 2 15 so here
and we will
probably have a special guest so please
do not be late so thank you everyone and
bon appetit
[Applause]
you
