and i hope you did too
everscales twitter is now verified with
a blue mark yeah
and the everscale anniversary nft
collection launched and it's up for
grabs so free nfts guys get them while
they're hot and since midnight last
night anyone can participate in
liquidity mining of eva tokens in two
new farming pools on the dexada platform
which is a chain agnostic everscale
powered dex
when flex right when flex
i know
so time to put those cardano assets to
work
and i know that there has been one
special subject burning in everybody's
mind these days which is the launch of
gosh
but please if you have questions
relating to gosh please save them for
tomorrow's ama which is scheduled may
18th at 4 pm utc
so
if you do have questions feel free to
ask them in the chats hashtag gosh ama
and i'll field them or you could just
ping me and i'll
collect them into the doc prepared for
tomorrow
so without further ado let's get on to
the tech updates meet you all yours
hello
um
yeah
so the updates very simple we finally
got a little bit action on the mod
update
site
which means that the percentages are
growing on the on the upgrades and i
know there are finally a line of people
went to
sergey
to get the instructions because the node
sometimes we we witnessed a node
shutting down for like three
hours
to to save the state
after the update um it will be gradual
um so
you should get patience but the most
important part that we get through this
this week that's the goal
so we need still everyone to go to
sergey to get instructions to get all
the details and to uh and to upgrade the
notes gradually one by one waiting until
the node is syncing again which can take
from one to three hours
um
once that's over with then we
can release many other things there was
accident on devnet uh this accident was
caused by a smart contract
stopping the shark
it is related to the last fix we did
which we kind of uh
we
didn't fix one of the cases basically
because the fixes are very harsh
like
we don't have basically time to
you know show us the stopping so we need
to fix
very quickly
and sometimes some things are stepping
from
you know from our attention or from
tests and uh that's what happened so
we've quickly quickly fixed it the
devnet was fixed within a couple of
hours we kind of recognized what we
missed and we fixed that
and everything is fine
but again all these fixes will be
introduced to the main net once the
once this this current update is
in place
that's i think really
it in terms of technical updates then
everything else will fall
into picture once we get this updated
okay great get those nodes upgraded
you've been saying it for weeks and
weeks on end so hopefully i know this is
the last week
get it done
so uh thank you very much michael moving
on to the agenda we have the maven
credit union interview
ben our very wonderful benjamin
interviewed gerard dash the executive
director of the gba the government
blockchain association
and he's going to be sharing what has
been dubbed as the most sustainable
blockchain credit union ever
benjamin
there we go so yes um
that's a fantastic intro i can't really
add much more to that um gerard as i say
is a fantastic storyteller a great man
um i don't get enough chance to speak to
him uh hopefully i've edited the
interview together well
although actually i've just realized
that maybe the wrong file
um so let's just quickly no it's not
there we go i'm doubting myself in my
mac abilities again so um if you can
just give me a thumbs up or a quick nod
and let me know this is all working well
when i start three two one
so gerard fantastic to uh have you on
camera again buddy it's been too long
going this far six or twelve months
since last we spoke
um i know you are busier than well most
uh most legions of men i know um but
specifically i've got five minutes to
talk to you here today for the lovely
everscale community about
come on
and i'll make sure i get this the right
way around the may 25th events for the
gba blockchain and sustainable
uh economic
development so i can't read my own
inviting here guys
and uh also this kind of ties very
nicely into a very exciting partnership
for our partnership opportunity again
i'll let you reveal the details uh with
maven credit union
so yeah gerald please tell us tell us
more about this sure well great
ben thank you so much for having me on
on your show and i mean great
of your work um yeah so so this is
really fascinating and let me sort of
start from the blockchain cryptocurrency
space right as we know a lot of folks
have uh been put off by sec and right
regulators in building blockchain and
cryptocurrency projects right a
fascinating thing happened there's a
there's a guy by the name of joseph lowe
he's the chairman of the uh of the
credit union and he he looked at the
correct the credit union legislation and
he said you know
it looks like they're talking about a
blockchain
because if you look at a credit union
and you look at a blockchain a credit
union is um it's a nonprofit so it's not
centrally controlled right it is uh it
has a field of membership which means
it's permission communication
of course exactly
you have to make decisions based on
um a survey of its members we call it
consensus
so he looked at this and he said wow
i don't know when the legislation was
written maybe the 1970s but it's like
they talked we were talking about
watching so he said can we build the
very first blockchain based credit union
uh a credit union without people and
branches literally a blockchain that
delivers the same banking services
right that a bank would except being
completely decentralized so sorry
obviously it is an idea which i've done
i've seen
it's been floated around in the past and
i've he has never come to life
in a true
true way
that i've been aware of up until now but
of course i mean the decentralization
didn't start with blockchain did it
credit unions are
an evolution of stuff
and so
well let me just share this a little bit
so
so this is potentially the very first
licensed decentralized autonomous
organization right
in the banking financial services system
so what what's amazing about that is
they realize that if they organize
around a credit union
they're outside of the jurisdiction of
the sec
so all of the all of the barriers
pushing back on these projects right
essentially don't apply in the credit
union so they came to us and they asked
us if we could work with them and or
feel the membership blah blah blah
and then they're trying to build out a
banking court
and uh i told him it's got to be a gba
member
so uh uh they were talking to non-gda
members i said that's not really good
for me so
they went to everscale and ever scale
one
well yeah a lot of people don't know
right
of course
they will know when the very the world's
first blockchain based credit union is
built on a core
that is provided by everscale and so
we're still working out the details um
this will be phenomenal for the
community it bring great recognition and
credibility um so we're really super
excited about the partnership yeah i
mean
yeah
everything you've just said above times
10 of course and he's fed very much into
my uh next question there so we can
throw that sticky pan away about what
you think this means for the everscale
community directly
and i think obviously the main kind of
question here then is uh may 25th gerard
uh the the event that's going on there
how does this all tie together um i
understand there's an nft contest as
well maybe you want to mention quickly
and some very exciting people going to
be there
yeah so if you go to uh
right gbaglobal.org
blockchain
um yeah you'll see information about the
event so we're bringing people together
from around the world i think uh we've
got like 28 embassies uh like 30
different uh net federal government
agencies uh state local and they're all
coming together to connect communicate
and collaborate and we focus on the idea
of governance as opposed to government
can we remove government right and bring
in decentralized processes right and
create an environment of governance
so that we can continue to grow our
economies in a way that's sustainable
right so you know we are looking at the
environmental stuff that that's
important but we're also talking about
financial inclusion we're also talking
about
economies right
uh you know when when the us government
continues to print money
right because it can is that how
sustainable is that
so we're we're bringing
public and private sector
together to focus on and and i think
this is hugely important forever skill
because we want every skill to be a more
and more uh important part of our group
definitely i mean of course we we know
here we've got the technology to do some
amazing things and the community with
the
obviously the
the drive to do it i'm gonna name drop
for you a little bit here uh we've got
uh people from embassies in canada
argentina el salvador india
saudi arabia philippines czech republic
uh bahrain belgium uh these are just the
embassies we've got coming up our us
defense health agency representatives um
more u.s house representatives than i
could name if this was a 15-minute
interview
um it really is a very very impressive
event you put together there sir
um so yeah will we be able to watch
along with this on youtube or other
tickets can is it going out live
how can we get involved in support yeah
so there are tickets that there are
virtual online tech gifts uh it will be
recorded and uh it will be broadcast
later on on the gba youtube channel um
do you guys have a youtube channel also
i think we do yeah yeah of course
that's where everyone's watching us now
okay
so we're moving available to you to you
guys so uh brilliant up here
yeah and then we uh if you go to if you
look at the government blockchain
association youtube channel you also see
all kinds of stuff from priorities
excellent well um i'll make sure to ping
a load of links up for this and uh yeah
thank you ever so much for speaking to
me tonight jared um
yeah may 25th day to remember and back
to either joanne or me or me and joanne
um speaking to you live
well i i i think there we have it folks
i mean drop drop the mic
where am i
i can't see myself but yes i mean yes uh
gerard
summing up everything that uh this means
to us in yeah more succinct fashion than
i could really uh begin to so
um i believe eugene may be able to
answer a few questions relating to this
if anyone has any um but probably i
would suggest best to wait until after
eugene's presentation as well because it
all sort of ties together i mean
eugene's a very very busy man as we all
know so yeah thank you very much that's
great thank you ben that was a really
great interview and thanks for getting
gerard to spend some time with us too
uh yeah that's absolutely a great
initiative um
it'll definitely be an impressive event
and everybody should definitely check it
out on the gba youtube channel for sure
and sign up on their website
yeah thank you very much
um
shall we move on to
the next on next point on our agenda is
the boogie on bali
last week alex shared with us with us
some insights from everscale's two-year
anniversary
the event in bali and today we have a
nikita here who will show some photos
and perhaps some
videos actually
actually uh joe i thought that uh
my god what my colleagues on broadcast
uh would be at the left of the show
for those videos some of the photos
videos were shared on um on
our smm channels and uh
most of it is still in uh
in the editing so you will see lots of
stuff
there i actually wanted to
um
share
some collaborations that were
executed i would say or done at the
conference because uh you know the
meaning of any meeting is uh
the ability people you know to
communicate
we've actually had a really productive
uh meeting with coin market cap
and i hope you will see actually some
people already that are subscribed to
coin market cap news channel uh
newsletter got
an email
uh with the everscale branding in it
and i don't know if anybody noticed uh
alex i think you did or maybe we shared
some thoughts about it
and we will be
uh gold sponsor of um
[Music]
online coin market cap conference i mean
by us i mean
so that's actually the thing i wanted to
wanted to share with you guys because um
actually a lot of you know
making a conference in bali was quite
polarizing because it's actually on
an opposite side of the world that some
of our
representatives of our
ecosystem
live
but it made
communications with the guys that
situated in asia much much easier
and uh so we really had a productive uh
time with the guys in asia again and uh
part of the poor market cap team that
situated in asia so again we will soon
have much more collaboration with one
market cap
and that's a good thing so i will not be
able to share any um
photos and videos unfortunately because
i i thought that
somebody from uh my team would help me
out with that but again every all the
all the
materials will be shared through our
social media
and our
you know all the cool photos and videos
that's basically uh
the most important thing i wanted to
share with you maybe some questions and
some of that
because i know i know alexa i know alex
share a lot of stuff we shared a lot of
live uh to the social media too
um so most of the people that uh
actually up today to our social media
are up to date
okay
well yeah i think what you're sharing
now is even better is there any way that
people can learn more about the
conference the coin market cap
conference that we're going to
everything will be shared uh everything
will be shared uh
this week uh as student to finalize it
everything will be shared so
all you guys will know 100 percent about
it just in the near future
okay
and what conference are you at now
uh uh sorry i actually um i actually now
we're not at the conference uh i
actually now uh in dubai trying to
arrange asp meetings with people
interested in again the ecosystem so uh
yeah dubai again okay busy busy yeah
yeah
okay cool well we'll look forward to um
all the content one since edited and you
could share more
about bali
cool thank you nikita
so moving on we're going to talk about a
devote everybody knows who this next
fella is he is the one and only eugene
morozov so he's here to share with us a
few things that have been going on in
the world of devote with the zk
end-to-end ballot return system which is
due to be piloted in washington at the
end of the month which is very exciting
eugene
yes hello hello can you hear me yes and
we can see it too
excellent so uh thank you very much for
inviting me to speak um
indeed this project is being piloted uh
during the uh
uh global uh government blockchain
association event uh which is happening
in washington dc
on may 25 uh 27 this is essentially a
seminar or a class
designed primarily for
u.s legislature
yes u.s congressmen and u.s senators
who want to learn
more about
blockchain who want to learn more about
what is possible
before they step in into their
regulation mode
so i think it's very very important to
explain uh what
great advantages
blockchain can bring to many things
including governance
so we were offered an opportunity
to act
as those people that will conduct
the vote the vote happens to be on a
best
nft that will be submitted um
to the art show at the conference but
the principles of that vote can be
applied to any other type of elections
so essentially what we're being offered
is a true
true ever scale community project that
goes back very deeply
to the very beginning of our network as
well
we call it zero knowledge
end to end
decentralized core functionality
ballot return system on blockchain
why is that important why is that needed
well
we believe at the moment there is no
system in the world
that would be
open to all fast enough affordable
secure undisputable
voting
now
what problem does that address
some of you may know that legislature in
many countries including the u.s
is prescribing the need for permanent
separation it's called permanent
separation of voter affidavit which is
essentially an identification of the
voter
and the voter ballot itself
the choices so the identification and
the choices must be permanently
separated and no existing mobile voting
system allows for that essentially any
administrator can simply go of the
system can go and see who voted how and
that's not allowed now that is severely
limiting the use of
mobile voting in the world
so
what we did about that is to offer an
end-to-end decentralized 100 on chain
zero knowledge snarks based technology
it is built of course on linearly
scalable average scale blockchain it is
100 compliant with that legal
requirement
it's open source free software license
and it's a real system it's a real app
that we build
all of that is based on uh the winner of
one of the ever scale
network contests that were run uh the
winner happens to be the mill foundation
headed by mikhail komarov and you will
see the link to github on your screen
uh there is another group under
alexander's vesting who is now building
the front end to that app which will be
showcasing
in washington dc
what is really fascinating about this is
the story it originated in our attempt
to dispute the infamous now mit and
harvard paper on blockchain faults in
election systems the community
essentially responded with the
theoretical papers one of which was
simply brilliant by
tomsk
university uh professors
which allowed for a theoretical
foundation
of what was later developed as part of
the cryptographies of governance
contest
to build the zero knowledge snarks based
solution which is essentially what was
done and then we
decided to move on and actually make
that a working app which is exactly what
happened with the help of a large team
that is working right now
and so on 25 27 of may
we will be having a global premiere
of zero knowledge snarks
voting system please come
vote for the best nft and support our
efforts thank you very much i will be
pleased to answer any questions anyone
may have joanne back to you
thank you eugene wow that was a
fantastic presentation and it's amazing
to see
an everscale contest coming to life and
being implemented
in such an important way it's it's
it's inspiring thank you very much for
sharing this especially the roadmap that
we see here if anybody has any questions
please um
chime in i don't see any hands raised
um
does anybody have any questions for
eugene
don't see any
okay i'm just gonna butt in and say
eugene would i be uh spoiling anything
if i shared a little screenshot on
twitter of that or uh uh am i under some
sort of oath
go ahead
it's live on youtube so
do what you want can't get in trouble
now
small question for me eugene if i may um
so what when would this be kind of
practically implemented somewhere you
see vogin in one of the countries or
an audit or something just some kind of
you know practical confirmation
good question thank you so we are
piloting this on the vote for the best
nft in the art show just to stay away
from any political issues clearly
however we already have signed uh nda
agreements with a number of reputable uh
us companies
that are very much part of the elections
industry
and we have an incredibly courageous um
county commissioner from county of utah
amelia powers
who is essentially pioneering new
technologies in order to provide her uh
voters with more opportunities to vote
for people that are ill and cannot come
to the polling station or maybe they're
stationed abroad on military bases or
for whatever other reason they are
unable to come to the actual polling
station so she is intended to give them
a
technical opportunity to exercise their
constitutional rights to vote so we
think that after we pilot this in
washington dc in an mft show the next
step
will be a number of elections of country
clubs
of which there are many thousands in the
united states and they constantly run
all kinds of elections and not
interested in this type of technology
which is uh decentralized and then after
that hopefully by the end of this year
we're going to have a pilot in the
actual u.s elections in the county of
utah
state of utah united states of america
thereafter
there's no saying how many different
jurisdictions we can cover i mean this
can probably upend and disrupt the
multi-billion existing voting industry
in the world
thank you
fantastic thank you thank you eugene
looking forward to what comes of this
and maybe we'll vote in the next
president with the technology
brought to you by everscale
thank you and with that we shall move on
to our agenda next we've got ben's bits
he's our resident hippie dude always
ready to share his
bits
all yours ah
i i'm going to ask you to add lib a
little um poem for me joe while i
quickly uh find my notes here i was
halfway through a tweet then sorry again
i'm so blown away by eugene's um
presentation and work and yeah i've been
following along with this ever since
i've joined everscale obviously um a lot
of the first articles i wrote were all
about blockchain and voting and i've
interviewed amelia
right let's find my notes sorry guys two
seconds
boom there we go
right so what we had uh we've had big
launches on everstart spartacats of
course that's gone awesomely hasn't it
uh they hits their caps 600 000 ever i
believe it was they reached
remp reliable external messaging
protocol sounds complicated but very
important and actually in end user terms
very very simple
uh right what else have we got we've got
huge nfts going nft giveaways going on
all over the place there's a there's a
bunch of giveaways forever as well
uh which i haven't got here um i'm
seeing something which i don't really
know what it is hugely but i'm
definitely gonna take a look later the
salad play room
what's a salad playroom when it's at
home but it sounds exciting everland why
haven't we been talking about everland
there's there's a lending protocol on
everscale which is launched no you know
there's there's literally a walk-through
available for you
uh oh god what else we got uh dexada um
cardano
bridge bridge she's two cardano and back
and forth so you know all those kind of
uh minor issues cardano users suffer
pounce on them tell them they can use
everscale instead
and it wouldn't be ben's bits without
closing on never mind the rumor mill
damn it guys we have been
myself and anastasia have been on fire
with getting ahead of all this news
lately um you know if you're if you're
not watching this
this podcast you're literally behind the
news so it's ten minutes ten ish minutes
anyway depending how long i prattle on
for three times a week usually gonna
toward the end of the evening monday
wednesday friday so you know we try to
feature ever scale news you know as
prominently as we can it's not aimed at
every scale audience but general
industry so yeah rock on people thank
you very much
oh thank you you mentioned dex ada i
want them to come on next week i saw
that i saw that in the chats
popping up i thought
well for those who want to get ahead of
the game on that there's a couple of
tutorials on youtube already uh voice
over by the way
yeah some annoying englishman did the
voiceover
okay cool so as anybody have any
comments questions i don't see any hands
up is there anything on youtube
i think it's a pretty pretty quick and
quiet call right now wrapped up no i'd
say succinct to be honest i mean yeah i
think if anything people must be a big
blown away
credit unions blockchain voting i mean
what what more do you want people yeah
next week next week's a big one
cool well thank you very much everybody
for joining i hope you have a great rest
of your week and
see you next tuesday
hi everyone
