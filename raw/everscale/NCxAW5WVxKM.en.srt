557
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,389
blockchain
platforms

558
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
platforms
 

559
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,750
platforms
so let's start with some figures yeah so

560
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
so let's start with some figures yeah so
 

561
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,590
so let's start with some figures yeah so
not so boring stats

562
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600
not so boring stats
 

563
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,430
not so boring stats
in 2021 so everscale managed to serve

564
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440
in 2021 so everscale managed to serve
 

565
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,190
in 2021 so everscale managed to serve
20 million transactions so this is one

566
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,200
20 million transactions so this is one
 

567
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,949
20 million transactions so this is one
of the most

568
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959
of the most
 

569
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,269
of the most
loaded blockchain ever

570
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:03,279

 

571
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,350

with it circulating supply

572
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
with it circulating supply
 

573
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,590
with it circulating supply
i will i'll speak about this a bit later

574
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
i will i'll speak about this a bit later
 

575
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,710
i will i'll speak about this a bit later
so uh

576
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
so uh
 

577
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,269
so uh
a bit over 1 billion so there are still

578
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
a bit over 1 billion so there are still
 

579
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,430
a bit over 1 billion so there are still
some treasury funds

580
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,440
some treasury funds
 

581
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,350
some treasury funds
available to

582
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
available to
 

583
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,030

with over half a million new accounts
 

589
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,310
with over half a million new accounts
created in the network so we are

590
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
created in the network so we are
 

591
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,829
created in the network so we are
standing in one of the top five networks

with 64 000 tps we are the number one
 

597
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,550
with 64 000 tps we are the number one
this is the most productive network

598
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
this is the most productive network
 

599
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,590
this is the most productive network

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,990
any kind of complex computations
anything you can imagine can be eaten in

606
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000
anything you can imagine can be eaten in
 

607
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,910
anything you can imagine can be eaten in
the everscale

608
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:49,920
the everscale
 

609
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,550

617
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,829

this is just the comparison with

618
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:03,839
this is just the comparison with
 

619
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,949
this is just the comparison with
one of the most nearby

620
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
one of the most nearby
 

621
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,990
one of the most nearby
i wouldn't say competitors i would say

622
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,000
i wouldn't say competitors i would say
 

623
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,949
i wouldn't say competitors i would say
neighbors in the blockchain ecosystem

624
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
neighbors in the blockchain ecosystem
 

625
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,629
neighbors in the blockchain ecosystem
so everscale

626
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
so everscale
 

627
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,069
so everscale
still

628
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,079
still
 

629
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,350
still
to reveal its true potential to lots of

630
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,360
to reveal its true potential to lots of
 

631
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,230
to reveal its true potential to lots of
different projects and uh

632
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
different projects and uh
 

633
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,509
different projects and uh
we will see a lot of growth a lot of new

634
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:25,519
we will see a lot of growth a lot of new
 

635
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,670
we will see a lot of growth a lot of new
initiatives a lot of interesting uh

636
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:31,680

 

637
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,389

i don't want to see projects again but a

638
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
i don't want to see projects again but a
 

639
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,069
i don't want to see projects again but a
lot of different

640
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
lot of different
 

641
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,389
lot of different
ecosystems to be grown

642
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
ecosystems to be grown
 

643
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,350
ecosystems to be grown
within everscale itself

644
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:43,360

 

645
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,910

let's speak about what actually happened

646
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:45,920
let's speak about what actually happened
 

647
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,710
let's speak about what actually happened
this year

648
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
this year
 

649
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,990
this year
this year

650
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
this year
 

651
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,110
this year
it was a year of rebranding

652
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
it was a year of rebranding
 

653
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,910
it was a year of rebranding
and uh initially the project as you know

654
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
and uh initially the project as you know
 

655
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,670
and uh initially the project as you know
was called the freighton

656
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:57,680
was called the freighton
 

657
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,829
was called the freighton
because it it took the sources of

658
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
because it it took the sources of
 

659
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,069
because it it took the sources of
original tone network because it has

660
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
original tone network because it has
 

661
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,389
original tone network because it has
excellent architecture and we made it

662
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
excellent architecture and we made it
 

663
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,590
excellent architecture and we made it
even better

664
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
even better
 

665
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,069
even better
so we fully improved the source code

666
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
so we fully improved the source code
 

667
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,030
so we fully improved the source code
over the original network and after that

668
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,040
over the original network and after that
 

669
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,069
over the original network and after that
so we

670
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
so we
 

671
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,069
so we
felt that

672
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
felt that
 

673
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,310
felt that
we are no more linked with the network

674
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
we are no more linked with the network
 

675
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,430
we are no more linked with the network
because we overcome it

676
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,440
because we overcome it
 

677
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,750
because we overcome it
and the new name was chosen it's the

678
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:21,760
and the new name was chosen it's the
 

679
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,150
and the new name was chosen it's the
name everscale

680
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
name everscale
 

681
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,230
name everscale
why was that like this

682
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
why was that like this
 

683
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,350
why was that like this
because

684
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
because
 

685
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,430
because
with all the infinite possibilities and

686
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:29,440
with all the infinite possibilities and

00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,120
and in 2021 we performed
 

789
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,310
and in 2021 we performed
one of the most complex operations ever

one of the most complex operations ever
 

791
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,870
one of the most complex operations ever
and we upgraded all the token standards

792
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
and we upgraded all the token standards
 

793
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,870
and we upgraded all the token standards
for those of you who are not developers

understanding so uh
 

799
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,430
understanding so uh
the token standard is something that

800
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:45,440
the token standard is something that
 

801
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,749
the token standard is something that
made the ethereum great

00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
made the ethereum great
 

803
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,949
made the ethereum great
it allowed

804
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
it allowed
 

805
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,590
it allowed
an infinite number of different projects

rules on how you identify the token and
 

813
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,670
rules on how you identify the token and
how you interact with it so you can make

814

how you interact with it so you can make

now we have two standards at least

00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:35,520
you can
 

843
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,150
you can
create different sets of rules for your

00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
create different sets of rules for your
 

845
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,230
create different sets of rules for your

and speaking about non-fungible it's not

already
a few of them have received the funding

1454
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:14,159
a few of them have received the funding
 

1455
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,710
a few of them have received the funding
and are now creating different kind of

1456
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:16,720
and are now creating different kind of
 

1457
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,590
and are now creating different kind of
solutions forever scale

1458
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:21,600

 

1459
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,549

but

1460
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:22,559
but
 

1461
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,149
but
also uh one of the the key performance

1462
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:26,159
also uh one of the the key performance
 

1463
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,950
also uh one of the the key performance
things is as a work with exchanges

1464
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:28,960
things is as a work with exchanges
 

1465
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,549
things is as a work with exchanges
in different analytical platforms and

1466
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:30,559
in different analytical platforms and
 

1467
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,630
in different analytical platforms and
now everscale is present

1468
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:32,640
now everscale is present
 

1469
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,870
now everscale is present
on all of the popular analytical

1470
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:34,880
on all of the popular analytical
 

1471

on all of the popular analytical
trackers so you can find information

1472
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:36,799
trackers so you can find information
 

1473
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,110
trackers so you can find information
about their scale easily and that was a

1474
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,120
about their scale easily and that was a
 

1475
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,110
about their scale easily and that was a
challenge i would say because everscale

1476
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,120
challenge i would say because everscale
 

1477
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,190
challenge i would say because everscale
is not evm compatible like any other

1478

and with their negotiation skills they
 

1483
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,269
and with their negotiation skills they
managed to get it natively listed on

1484
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:49,279
managed to get it natively listed on
 

1485
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,669
managed to get it natively listed on
those platforms

1486

familiar with how blockchain development

2058
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:22,960
familiar with how blockchain development
 

2059
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,670
familiar with how blockchain development
goes so understand the complexity of

2060
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:25,680
goes so understand the complexity of
 

2061
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,109
goes so understand the complexity of
this

2062
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:27,119
this
 

2063
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,510
this
thing and this achievement

2064
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:29,520
thing and this achievement
 

2065
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,030
thing and this achievement
but why

2066
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,040
but why
 

2067
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,710
but why
it's crucial

2068
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:32,720
it's crucial
 

2069
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,510
it's crucial
because with new nodes

2070
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:35,520
because with new nodes
 

2071
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,829
because with new nodes
we unlock a lot of new features of the

2072
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:37,839
we unlock a lot of new features of the
 

2073
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,790
we unlock a lot of new features of the
scale and finally we can get the maximum

2074
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:40,800
scale and finally we can get the maximum
 

2075
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,390
scale and finally we can get the maximum
of this network

2076
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:42,400
of this network
 

2077
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,589
of this network
including the super fast uh

2078
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:45,599
including the super fast uh
 

2079
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,630
including the super fast uh
smart uh soft majority fault tolerant

2080
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:48,640
smart uh soft majority fault tolerant
 

2081
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,550
smart uh soft majority fault tolerant
protocol so yeah i named it uh

2082
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:52,560
protocol so yeah i named it uh
 

2083
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,630
protocol so yeah i named it uh
it will allow us to

2084
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:54,640
it will allow us to
 

2085
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,790
it will allow us to
radically reduce guest fees

2086
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:56,800
radically reduce guest fees
 

2087
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,190
radically reduce guest fees
up to 100k 100 times

2088
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:01,200
up to 100k 100 times
 

2089
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,910
up to 100k 100 times
at the same time to allow us to make gas

2090
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:03,920
at the same time to allow us to make gas
 

2091
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,190
at the same time to allow us to make gas
really dynamic and to motivate

2092
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:07,200
really dynamic and to motivate
 

2093
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,790
really dynamic and to motivate
validators and

2094
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:08,800
validators and
 

2095
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,030
validators and
network developers

it will allow us to achieve even higher

2098
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:12,880
it will allow us to achieve even higher
 

2099
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,710
it will allow us to achieve even higher
throughput

2100
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:14,720

attacks and replay attacks uh with the

2104
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:21,280
attacks and replay attacks uh with the
 

2105
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,349

and this is only one of the few things

2108
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:26,960
and this is only one of the few things
 

2109
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,349
and this is only one of the few things
to name but of course if you have a look

2110
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:29,359
to name but of course if you have a look
 

2111
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,829
to name but of course if you have a look
at the list of features that uh come

2112
00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:31,839
at the list of features that uh come
 

2113
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,309
at the list of features that uh come
with the new notes so

2114
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:34,319
with the new notes so
 

2115
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,950
with the new notes so
it's much longer

2116
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:36,960
it's much longer
 

2117
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,150
it's much longer
also in this year we are planning to

2118
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,160
also in this year we are planning to
 

2119
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,270
also in this year we are planning to
launch

2120
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,280
launch
 

2121
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,349
launch
two new work chains

2122
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:43,359
two new work chains
 

2123
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,430
two new work chains
every skill pretty much like polka dot

2124
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:45,440
every skill pretty much like polka dot
 

2125
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,510
every skill pretty much like polka dot
and near so allow to

2126
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:47,520
and near so allow to
 

2127
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,349
and near so allow to
you to create

2128
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:49,359
you to create
 

2129
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,630
you to create
work chains

2130
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:50,640
work chains
 

2131
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,030
work chains
with different set of rules this can

2132
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:53,040
with different set of rules this can
 

2133
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,270
with different set of rules this can
also include different virtual machines

2134
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:55,280
also include different virtual machines
 

2135
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,630
also include different virtual machines
that can include

2136
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:56,640
that can include
 

2137
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,230
that can include
different uh

2138
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:58,240
different uh
 

2139
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,190
different uh
way of how it it's validated

2140
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:01,200
way of how it it's validated
 

2141
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,349
way of how it it's validated
but two new things to be introduced this

2142
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:03,359
but two new things to be introduced this
 

2143
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,550
but two new things to be introduced this
year are

2144
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:04,560
year are
 

2145
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,349
year are
the ones that we desperately need and so

2146
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:07,359
the ones that we desperately need and so
 

2147
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,589
the ones that we desperately need and so
they are already in development the

2148
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:09,599
they are already in development the
 

2149
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,750
they are already in development the
first one is the evm blockchain

2150
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:11,760
first one is the evm blockchain
 

2151
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,349
first one is the evm blockchain
workchain sorry so uh why it's crucial

2152
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:15,359
workchain sorry so uh why it's crucial
 

2153
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,750
workchain sorry so uh why it's crucial
because thanks to ethereum

2154
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:17,760
because thanks to ethereum
 

2155
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,750
because thanks to ethereum
there is a huge market of solidity

and to facilitate the hopping on the
 

2161
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,430
and to facilitate the hopping on the
everscale network so it's

2162
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:27,440
everscale network so it's
 

2163
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,550
everscale network so it's
important

2164
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:28,560
important
 

2165
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,630
important
