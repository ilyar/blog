well because they like to go green
and do you know why i'm talking much
about island today
because the first thing you have to
learn about easy pay mastercard it's
irish
and to be more precise it has an irish
iban
so
we are officially an agent to electronic
money institution
pfs
which is regulated and authorized by
central bank of ireland
and
i wanted to move on um
to our session now and tell you a little
bit more about pi union products
uh i will see if i can share my screen
so it's easier
um
to show than
to talk on my fingers
so let me see if
you can see my presentation or not
[Music]
okay let's see can you see it now or is
it just a blank screen
just just a blank screen

flinch

and that's it
okay
so it's
a bit pity
not to show it
um
still
not working
okay sorry guys
you cannot see it
let me see
which way we can do it
i share this can you see something now
um there is something the website yeah
there is a white
white screen on white screen yeah
maybe
uh can you maybe can you send it to me

if you can send it to me i can share it
no problem
let's see sorry guys
so we will just
go
again i will send it to roman by
um
you're waiting
yeah so it's sand
um
if you can go
let me let me try to share it
just a moment
yeah
here's it
3 or something like this so i will just
start talking about the
pi union
and
once roman opens the presentation i will
show you more details so we started in
2014 uh with a simple idea that anyone
in any country uh should get an easy and
secure way to invest um and increase
their capital by using crypto
we worked for several years now and a
team from different countries
has been working under the pi union
and we brought together different
products and now i wanted to show the
product portfolio what we currently can
offer and then we will
stop on and go
and look into the easy play um
mastercard
no
do you see it now
i don't see the presentation
no
yeah and now you see
it should be available yeah yeah now i
can see it if you go to the page number
five
this is where we have all our products
um and i was talking about
um
the investment platform and about where
you can buy a rent properties using
crypto and also we offer um an encrypted
atm network if you go to the next slide
um it gives you more information um
where you can buy and sell crypto in
cash uh using um our atm network
uh and finally uh
and the most important is uh the cryptic
currency exchange xpi platform which is
the next slide
yeah and here we are talking about
a licensed crypto um
exchange um
platform and also we are working on a
hybrid acquiring our product this is it
will give you uh the ability to pay for
any product with the cryptocurrency
and thanks to our public api
the merchant can embed a window on their
website with the ability to pay for
goods according to a hebrew scheme uh
the buyer pays in crypto and the seller
receives funds in the field
so
this um these are two uh products are
still being developed the integration uh
of the mobile app and atm so you can buy
and sell crypto uh in cash and also a
hybrid acquired acquiring if you max
if we move next um to the next slide
uh we
we can see the xpi trading platform and
this is our existing uh product where
you can trade bitcoin ethereum uh ever
and of course a stable you stable coin
european
and
um
uh here if you go on to the next point
uh
we are talking about
our
service features this is where you can
um
have a public api and defeat gateway and
of course you can top up uh your crypto
wallet with the bank transfer or by a
visa or mastercard and this visa
mastercard can be issued in any country
and if you want to withdraw your crypto
you can do it to
a bank account in euro in eurozone and
the fee we charge is only one percent
so
uh let's move on uh to the main point
which we are gathered together for our
ama session it's an easy pay mastercard
and we take a look at the new slide
yeah
so
now i um i talked a little bit about our
xp
trade
exchange platform where you can buy
and sell crypto and ever of course
and now we have our mobile app
easy pay with the card
so
what do we have now and this is not a
promise about the future but this is our
real product this is when you go uh to
the app store and you download our free
mobile app
and when you go through the ekyc process
you can
order a mastercard
and once you've done and complete
and completed onboarding process
um
you will go into your mobile app and you
will have a european or as i already
said irish iban straight away so you
don't need to wait for it it will be
available for you on the mobile app
straight away but the actual
plastic master card will arrive by mail
within 14 days
and i have to stress out that currently
this product is available only for
european residents
and also
we still include united kingdom here as
well
um
so
as you can see we have these two
products the xpei web application
where you can where we have ever
integration and where you can buy and
sell uh crypto crypto and we have um a
mobile app with the mastercard
mastercard
so
we understand that
now we have this one non-optimized
uh moment when in order to buy and sell
crypto and ever you have to login to the
actual web
extension of the xpr trade and you have
to do two separate registration to
easily pay and to the exit rate
so we are trying to solve this problem
and offer a new improved product
which will give you an opportunity to
have your crypto wallets and balances
and your
mastercard in one place
and we call it um easy pay
web 2.0 product
and we hope that this will solve the
inconvenience um of logging to two
different platforms and you will have
all in one
in one place
so if you move to the next slide
you can see him yeah so so this is our
new version
easy pay 2.0
uh i hope we will be able to demonstrate
it to you on the 1st of april so now
it's already
passed through our first mvp and we are
testing it so this is how it looks like
so
from one side you can
hold the cart and on another side you
see all your crypto balances and you can
buy sell crypto and use our bridge
crypto to figure out and withdraw euro
up to any iban
and um when i'm saying to any iban of
course i mean that the best and the
cheapest way will be for you to
withdraw ever if you use our easy pay
mastercard
okay so that's about what we have at the
moment
and if we move on to the next slide we
can take a look at the um coming soon um
features
yeah thank you so
yeah as i mentioned
here you can see
how the easy pay mobile app looks now so
it's a it's quite simple uh simple um it
has uh you can it will show you the eye
button on top of the screen it has your
card and a payment button
so
as i said um soon enough
in april we will be able to demonstrate
you an upgraded version where you can
buy and sell
ever just like
a fiat using our new
easy pay version 2 app
we're also
planning
to introduce and
um issue mastercard to
cis residents so including moldova
kyrgyzstan kazakhstan and of course
russia
this product this project is still
ongoing and with the current
situation uh it was a little bit delayed
so we have to find new partners in the
uh friendly
countries to us
and
then uh we also have a possibility we
will have a possibility uh to order a
virtual card
this virtual card
option will be uh available with the new
version when we upgrade it to easy pay
2.0 version
and as i already mentioned in the
beginning where we have our
at crypto atm
integration
uh we are also working on this where you
you have your easy pay
mobile app you have qr code which you
can connect to atm and you have a
possibility
to
top up and to withdraw um
cash
using your crypto wallet so you
basically you can buy and sell crypto
using cash
okay so
yeah if we move on to the next slide
i just wanted uh to summarize and uh
give the main information about the
benefits of easy paycard
uh sure this is the classic mastercard
with the direct link to your crypto
wallet and you will have a european
iban without visiting the bank and it's
important to say that we won't do any
credit checks
on you and
you will have your irish ipad which will
be available to you straight after the
onboarding process has been completed
well as
any mastercard
you can use easy pay for online payments
or hotel bookings and atm withdrawals
and separate payments
it's quite universal
and um i will go through the tariffs and
um
limits just
a little bit
later
but the main thing to say is that
um
we have a very low fees on atm deposits
because as i said we have a friendly atm
network and
um the withdrawal fee is 1.99
and the foreign exchange fee is 0.99
which is quite um competitive as i can
uh
tell you like for example if you travel
with this card to dubai and you want to
get a taxi from the airport to downtown
you can use easy pay mastercard in any
atm in the airport and withdraw
dear harms
paying just 0.99
and i can assure you it will be cheaper
if you just go and change 100 euros
to
your homes in the
currency exchange shop
and uh yeah sure we have ekyc which is
done just in four clicks and in 15
minutes we will go through uh the
koic process in more details because
i normally receive a lot of questions
around this topic
if you move on
uh to the next slide
uh we are going to talk about the
benefits of the mobile app
yeah roman
don't sleep no no yeah
just
disconnect okay
uh yeah here we go
here we have
a benefits of the mobile app as i said
it's quite simple you can see it uh in
the corner it has a payment button which
gives you an instant step of payments
uh you can
send you can risk receive money quickly
it also safe as we use a 3d secure
online
system
and of course
it's it is a reliable european
mastercard contract plus mastercard
and
it's very easy as i already said to open
an account
we have a customer support available 24
7 with all human english speaking
guys and
also another feature what we currently
have it's a notification so for any
transactions debiter credit he will
receive
an instant notification
um
on your mobile app
and let's move on to the tariffs um
because i think the
question everyone has is how much will
it cost
so now the cost of the actual plastic
card is
9.99 euros
and the service fee is 0.99
per month
so yeah it will cost you about 12 euros
a year and that's
mostly it because not every day you
withdraw cash from the atm which cost
you 1.99 euro and as i already explained
explained before the foreign exchange
fee is quite competitive and it is
0.99 percent
yeah i can show you this is the way how
the card looks
so
the normal card
and
as i said all other
transactions receiving money paying with
your card online
um
checking the balances
uh in the app
or
doing pin reissue everything is for free
um
okay so
let's
finish up
with the last slide
i wanted again to say how easy it is
to get the card you just go to the apple
store google play and download the free
easy pay app
you have to provide
proof of it id and proof of address
together with the quick selfie
during the registration process and once
onboarding is done you will have your
ipad instantly and you have to wait 10
days to get the card by post
so that's the main things i wanted to
tell you today about the mastercard easy
pay
and we can move to q and a
session
and actually i i did prepare a couple of
more slides
uh based on on your questions i've
already received
so uh roman if we can move to like
and yeah and next one
it has a lot of details and
probably i will just spend time and
explain it because
i think that's the we have most of
questions about um which documents do
you accept which don't so
let me explain so when we are talking
about proof of identity
we can accept passport we can accept
national identity card
driving license
we can accept a resident card but it's
only valid in the camp country of
residence
so what it means if you are currently
living in spain and
you show us a resident card from ireland
that's not good so if you live in spain
you have to show your residents hall in
spain
we also accept citizen card but only for
british british citizens
and there is also another way of
guard the ah card but it applies only to
ireland
as uh i already mentioned uh pfs is
regulated by central bank of ireland and
they have more opportunities to
do checks and accept these documents
and
in relation to a proof of address
we also accept a lot of documents uh
it's not only
utility bills like gasoline electricity
we we do provide the mobile
phones
bills
we also accept
car or home insurance policy documents
we accept a government issued documents
uh when you have a stamp and a proper
pro pro looking uh government issued
documents yeah we also as usual accept
bank and credit card statements and um
second identity documents mentioning the
address
declared during the creating the account
so which it means if you have your
identity card
with the proof of address on it we can
accept it if for
uh proof of identity you showed us your
passport
so passport and
identity card with the proof of address
on it will be sufficient
well
the
most important thing also you please
make a good
good photo of the document so it shows
all four
sides
of the documents so it's just not top uh
of the page
um it should have your name um
an address on it and for proof of
address
the document should be issued in the
past three months
i think that's the most important
questions about kyc
and another
question i already got was about
onboarding
well
when you upload all your
documents
using the phone
it goes to
some sub thumbs up
kyc provider who will do
checks for us
and
yeah roman you can move to the 19th
slide
because when all the checks are
not done but when you uploaded all
documents um using the mobile app
you will see this verification uh start
to screen
and i think a little a lot of people get
confused oh
oh i cannot press any buttons here
what should i do like what happened so
actually it says here that you you have
to wait 24 hours
while we are checking your documents
and that onboarding is under review
so what it means
that the documents you have submitted
went to a sums up
for checks
and
if the documents haven't been accepted
automatically it will go to a manual
check
by our kyc officer
and as we are talking about
manual labor here we have to allow some
time for the
person to take a look into your
documents and if something is missing or
something is wrong
the kyc officer will be in contact with
you by email which you have provided
during the registration process and he
or she will advise you
how to complete onboarding
so that's the main
things around kyc and onboarding
process
and yeah thanks thanks for your time
and now i'm ready uh for more questions
if we have
um actually i've got the several
questions from the community
uh from the chats that
uh been discussed uh so the first
question that i market for for myself
that
uh when
are you going to launch your products uh
similar products in the united states in
the asia regions maybe in latin america
and other and
um
there was an additional question that uh
if someone want to to cooperate with you
or who they should contact
uh yeah the first point of contact
for
every scale community is definitely
myself
i am in telegram and
yeah you can share my contact details in
telegram that's no problem i can assist
you
and in relation to other questions
well about america and asia
we don't have plans at the moment we are
really
working hard on extending our services
um in moldova kazakhstan kyrgyzstan
russia um
so all all these uh countries and of
course uh serbia and
how you call the candidates to
countries candidate countries to um
europe
so that's our main target
uh the next question was uh
uh i uh
i i working only this mastercard and
visa they have some plans for the union
pay other
other payment
gateways
uh yeah it's a good question i think uh
looking at the current situation in the
world
but
unfortunately it's currently it's only
mastercard
which we are offering and with the
partners we are talking uh to now for
the future
it also will be a mastercard but just
available for
russia kazakhstan kyrgyzstan moldova and
other countries
so
the question is it's only a mastercard
at the moment
and in the in the near future as well
and and again this is as far as i know
as far as my competence goes if
yeah i can find out from the ceo if he
has more plans to extend to america or
asia
the next question
is i plan to integrate other fintech
products as a farming and staking uh
into your app
uh
the que uh the straight answer will be
yes we have a lot of projects going on
and
i i don't know exactly when because we
have other product managers
responsible for
those
areas but the answer will be yes
uh
one more question uh
how
can you protect uh the funds against the
fraud
and cetera et cetera maybe some
audit
conclusion
yeah sure
for
um
as i already mentioned we are an agent
to electronic file institution pfs who
is actually issuing the cards and
they do
annual audit checks um
on us how we accept documents and how we
process
all the transactions
we also have our internal
eml
procedures where we
monitor the transactions on a daily
basis and if it
if it has certain limits it highlights
to us
plus
as i already mentioned we have a 3d
secure online um
system which which is secure to to use
the cards
online we always use a two-step
verification
and yeah that's
probably not everything but
yeah as i already mentioned simplicity
and security these are our main
priorities for the customers
uh that's all what i have uh maybe there
are questions from the participants of
the
discord stream uh guys
raise your hand and ask the question
yeah and as i said please feel free
to get in contact with me directly on
telegram
and especially while you have you might
have some questions around kyc
procedures or
any other questions and
and even if you have any recommendations
or comments about the current up uh
mobile up we
we are upgrading it and we are trying to
make it as easy
as possible to use for the clients so
and your feedback
is welcome
uh
yeah maybe they're shy a little bit yeah
just let me see there uh there was a
question uh in the chat that i've seen
um
the the most a question i think that
answered because uh
they asked more about the when you
launch the
your product in kazakhstan and other
mothers in that you already answered
this
yeah uh so uh regarding the um
regarding the why at least uh what
will user could uh
could could get how long should they
wait
uh in the white list uh do you have some
channels for the update and of the
updates uh where they can get the
fresh information
um
do you mean a fresh information about
the the cart or the new upcoming uh
crypto wallet
um cryptic countries i can say uh that
in the country that will be available
for them yeah and the countries which
will we will be available yeah as um as
uh i probably have uh forgot to mention
that on yeah when the system crashed and
i couldn't share the screens
[Music]
on the website on the pi union website
we have
a form to complete
if you
would like to express your interest in
ordering easy pay mastercard
and there is an um
option to select the country where are
you currently resident so the reason
behind is so we can

your interest and it will go to the
queue and once we have
a card available in your country you

about africa america or asia we are more
focused on cis and countries
thank you and uh maybe could you share
uh the main uh
the main uh
social networks that
community can subscribe maybe maybe
there you bring some contest as well
yeah because there are many interested
persons
and such activities

moment

there's no more question from the
community that uh don't see ah yeah uh

i just want to wish good luck you
because this is very important i think
that
uh
one from the mainly stone of the of the
total uh our scale that we can achieve
in the near future if we reach so many
