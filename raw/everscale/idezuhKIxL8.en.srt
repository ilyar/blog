22
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:23,920
some challenges building decentralized
 

23
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,630
some challenges building decentralized
internet

24
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640

 

25
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,230

and i named it

26
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,240
and i named it
 

27
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,630
and i named it
building decentralized internet and not

28
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
building decentralized internet and not
 

29
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,270
building decentralized internet and not
just a decentralized application or uh

30
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
just a decentralized application or uh
 

31
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,709
just a decentralized application or uh
or a blockchain decentralized

32
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:36,719
or a blockchain decentralized
 

33
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,069
or a blockchain decentralized
is because

34
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:38,079
is because
 

35
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,590
is because
we believe that

36
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
we believe that
 

37
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,350
we believe that
it's not enough just to build a

38
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:41,360
it's not enough just to build a
 

39
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,510
it's not enough just to build a

45
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,150
backbone
um we believe that

46
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
um we believe that
 

47
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,069
um we believe that
we have a problem of centralization of

48
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:52,079
we have a problem of centralization of
 

49
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,430
we have a problem of centralization of
the internet today and um

50
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
the internet today and um
 

51
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,270
the internet today and um
just give a brief example why do i think

52
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
just give a brief example why do i think
 

53
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,790
just give a brief example why do i think
it's not such a good idea

54
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
it's not such a good idea
 

55
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,150
it's not such a good idea
simply because

56
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160
simply because
 

57
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,189
simply because
the laws of evolution tells us

58
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,199
the laws of evolution tells us
 

59
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,510
the laws of evolution tells us
that we would not be sitting today

60
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
that we would not be sitting today
 

61
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,149
that we would not be sitting today
if if the evolution process would be

62
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
if if the evolution process would be
 

63
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,429
if if the evolution process would be
centralized

64
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439
centralized
 

65
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,310
centralized
meaning

66
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320

 

67
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,350

people

68
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
people
 

69
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,550
people
or species doesn't matter they tend to

70
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
or species doesn't matter they tend to
 

71
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,630
or species doesn't matter they tend to
make wrong decisions sometimes

72
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:20,640
make wrong decisions sometimes
 

73
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,350
make wrong decisions sometimes
and sometimes these wrong decisions

74
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360
and sometimes these wrong decisions
 

75
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,149
and sometimes these wrong decisions
are just deadly

76
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
are just deadly
 

77
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,390
are just deadly
so imagine if the evolution

78
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400
so imagine if the evolution
 

79
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,270
so imagine if the evolution
where

80
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
where
 

81
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,149
where
all this pieces would reach one decision

82
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
all this pieces would reach one decision
 

83
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,230
all this pieces would reach one decision
i think this this business would live

84
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
i think this this business would live
 

85
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,830
i think this this business would live
very very short

86
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
very very short
 

87
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,710
very very short
time

88
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:38,720
time
 

89
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,310
time
because simply because they would make

90
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,320
because simply because they would make
 

91
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,830
because simply because they would make
her some wrong decision and they would

92
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
her some wrong decision and they would
 

93
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,310
her some wrong decision and they would
be all dead

94
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
be all dead
 

95
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,469
be all dead
so we need to allow

96
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:46,479
so we need to allow
 

97
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,550
so we need to allow
this process where

98
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
this process where
 

99
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,910
this process where
a lot of groups

100
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
a lot of groups
 

101
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,270
a lot of groups
a lot of people species that reaching

102
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
a lot of people species that reaching
 

103
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,830
a lot of people species that reaching
different decisions in a decentralized

104
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
different decisions in a decentralized
 

105
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,590
different decisions in a decentralized
way

106
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
way
 

107
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,469
way
and

108
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:58,479
and
 

109
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,749
and
now

110
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
now
 

111
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,230
now
how do we do that

112
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,240
how do we do that
 

113
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,310
how do we do that
and of course bitcoin was the first to

114
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
and of course bitcoin was the first to
 

115
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,429
and of course bitcoin was the first to
build

116
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
build
 

117
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,670
build
such a such a network where

118
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:07,680
such a such a network where
 

119
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,469
such a such a network where
where it allowed for the first time uh

120
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
where it allowed for the first time uh
 

121
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,750
where it allowed for the first time uh
for

122
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
for
 

123
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,309
for
people who joined the network

124
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
people who joined the network
 

125
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,790
people who joined the network
to not need to trust each other

126
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:16,800
to not need to trust each other
 

127
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,270
to not need to trust each other
and there is no point of trust in

128
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,280
and there is no point of trust in
 

129
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,309
and there is no point of trust in
blockchain

130
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
blockchain
 

131
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,790
blockchain
in a public blockchain and that's

132
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800
in a public blockchain and that's
 

133
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,350
in a public blockchain and that's
exactly why i think private blockchains

134
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
exactly why i think private blockchains
 

135
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,030
exactly why i think private blockchains
are just meaningless just it's just a

136
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
are just meaningless just it's just a
 

137
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,790
are just meaningless just it's just a
wrong branch of an evolution

138
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
wrong branch of an evolution
 

139
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,630
wrong branch of an evolution
of the technology

140
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
of the technology
 

141
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,670
of the technology
okay so

142
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,680
okay so
 

143
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,390
okay so
if we have a trustless network

144
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
if we have a trustless network
 

145
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,949
if we have a trustless network
so of course satoshi wanted this network

146
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
so of course satoshi wanted this network
 

147
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,550
so of course satoshi wanted this network
to be financial

148
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,560
to be financial
 

149
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,589
to be financial
uh

150
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
uh
 

151
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,710
uh
backbone to to provide for trustless

152
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
backbone to to provide for trustless
 

153
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,070
backbone to to provide for trustless
finance

154
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
finance
 

155
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,110
finance
and

156
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120
and
 

157
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,030
and
in a developed this way all the way up

158
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
in a developed this way all the way up
 

159
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,030
in a developed this way all the way up
to today

160
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
to today
 

161
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,110
to today
but in parallel to this

162
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
but in parallel to this
 

163
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,030
but in parallel to this
there is there is an internet right

164
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
there is there is an internet right
 

165
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,949
there is there is an internet right
there is a larger internet there are

166
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
there is a larger internet there are
 

167
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,390
there is a larger internet there are
where users

168
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
where users
 

169
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,710
where users
are putting their data on they have

170
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
are putting their data on they have
 

171
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,270
are putting their data on they have
applications that they're running right

172
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
applications that they're running right
 

173
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,869
applications that they're running right
and this

174
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
and this
 

175
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,309
and this
internet

176
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
internet
 

177
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,830
internet
evolution

178
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
evolution
 

179
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,990
evolution
it made just an opposite direction

180
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
it made just an opposite direction
 

181
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,309
it made just an opposite direction
completely it just went to the opposite

182
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
completely it just went to the opposite
 

183
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,350
completely it just went to the opposite
direction

184
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
direction
 

185
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,750
direction
where it started to become monopolized

186
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
where it started to become monopolized
 

187
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,070
where it started to become monopolized
by very few entities and i'm talking

188
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
by very few entities and i'm talking
 

189
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,830
by very few entities and i'm talking
about google i'm talking about you know

190
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
about google i'm talking about you know
 

191
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,830
about google i'm talking about you know
facebook and so on

192
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
facebook and so on
 

193
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,110
facebook and so on
in this

194
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
in this
 

195
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,910
in this
um this monopolization of course is

196
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
um this monopolization of course is
 

197
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,830
um this monopolization of course is
wrong on in the market because like

198
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
wrong on in the market because like
 

199
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,509
wrong on in the market because like
governments around the world are trying

200
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
governments around the world are trying
 

201
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,270
governments around the world are trying
to fight monopolization all the time

202
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
to fight monopolization all the time
 

203
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,229
to fight monopolization all the time
because the market becomes inefficient

204
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
because the market becomes inefficient
 

205
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,949
because the market becomes inefficient
while in the internet it went this

206
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
while in the internet it went this
 

207
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,309
while in the internet it went this
direction

208
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319
direction
 

209
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,149
direction
be and it went with this direction

210
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159
be and it went with this direction
 

211
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,670
be and it went with this direction
because every market actually if you

212
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
because every market actually if you
 

213
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,550
because every market actually if you
don't regulate the market it will sooner

214
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
don't regulate the market it will sooner
 

215
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,789
don't regulate the market it will sooner
or later become monopolized because

216
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
or later become monopolized because
 

217
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,630
or later become monopolized because
simply because that's the motivation of

218
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
simply because that's the motivation of
 

219
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,149
simply because that's the motivation of
the party the motivation of economic

220
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
the party the motivation of economic
 

221
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,229
the party the motivation of economic
parts in the market is to grab as much

222
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
parts in the market is to grab as much
 

223
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,309
parts in the market is to grab as much
power as possible in the way of revenues

224
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
power as possible in the way of revenues
 

225
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,630
power as possible in the way of revenues
right that's what the enterprise is

226
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
right that's what the enterprise is
 

227
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,670
right that's what the enterprise is
optimized for is making revenue

228
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
optimized for is making revenue
 

229
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,070
optimized for is making revenue
same thing when you allow

230
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
same thing when you allow
 

231
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,429
same thing when you allow
the internet

232
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
the internet
 

233
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,630
the internet
um

234
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
um
 

235
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,229
um
to develop like the businesses on the

236
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
to develop like the businesses on the
 

237
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,149
to develop like the businesses on the
internet these businesses will will tend

238
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
internet these businesses will will tend
 

239
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,789
internet these businesses will will tend
to monopolize in exactly like in any

240
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
to monopolize in exactly like in any
 

241
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,070
to monopolize in exactly like in any
other market and that's what we are

242
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
other market and that's what we are
 

243
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,229
other market and that's what we are
witnessing today so right so we have the

244
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
witnessing today so right so we have the
 

245
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,069
witnessing today so right so we have the
internet which is a bad one of all the

246
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
internet which is a bad one of all the
 

247
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,270
internet which is a bad one of all the
data and all the human knowledge which

248
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
data and all the human knowledge which
 

249
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,749
data and all the human knowledge which
is monopolized by very few parties

250
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
is monopolized by very few parties
 

251
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,469
is monopolized by very few parties
and i i don't think this is such a good

252
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
and i i don't think this is such a good
 

253
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,830
and i i don't think this is such a good
development

254
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
development
 

255
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,870
development
if you think about the evolution

256
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
if you think about the evolution
 

257
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,150
if you think about the evolution
and process we described in the

258
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
and process we described in the
 

259
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,350
and process we described in the
beginning

260
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
beginning
 

261
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,070
beginning
so

262
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
so
 

263
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,670
so
for that

264
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
for that
 

265
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,749
for that
we thought okay so let's we have

266
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
we thought okay so let's we have
 

267
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,110
we thought okay so let's we have
industrialized technology we have a

268
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
industrialized technology we have a
 

269
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,189
industrialized technology we have a
technology like the backbone like the

270
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
technology like the backbone like the
 

271
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,510
technology like the backbone like the
database and we can run an applications

272
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
database and we can run an applications
 

273
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,189
database and we can run an applications
on this database now

274
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
on this database now
 

275
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,270
on this database now
um and it's a it's decentralized meaning

276
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
um and it's a it's decentralized meaning
 

277
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,710
um and it's a it's decentralized meaning
the parties don't need to trust each

278
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
the parties don't need to trust each
 

279
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,909
the parties don't need to trust each
other so why wouldn't that be good idea

280
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
other so why wouldn't that be good idea
 

281
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,990
other so why wouldn't that be good idea
maybe to put these applications that

282
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
maybe to put these applications that
 

283
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,830
maybe to put these applications that
just just not just financial application

284
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:55,840
just just not just financial application
 

285
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,390
just just not just financial application
but basically any application

286
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
but basically any application
 

287
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,830
but basically any application
or at least some

288
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
or at least some
 

289
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,909
or at least some
portion of this application which which

290
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
portion of this application which which
 

291
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,469
portion of this application which which
requires that to put that part in a

292
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
requires that to put that part in a
 

293
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,790
requires that to put that part in a
decentralized way

294
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
decentralized way
 

295
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,510
decentralized way
on a decentralized network so

296
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
on a decentralized network so
 

297
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,310
on a decentralized network so
what would we need to do to even

298
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
what would we need to do to even
 

299
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,550
what would we need to do to even
technically to allow this kind of

300
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
technically to allow this kind of
 

301
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,189
technically to allow this kind of
thing right so first of all

302
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
thing right so first of all
 

303
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,029
thing right so first of all
it is it it must be

304
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039

 

305
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,749

the demand on this on this backbone is

306
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
the demand on this on this backbone is
 

307
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,990
the demand on this on this backbone is
would be huge right because

308
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
would be huge right because
 

309
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,070
would be huge right because
it um there are millions of people who

310
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
it um there are millions of people who
 

311
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,590
it um there are millions of people who
are using internet today there are there

312
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
are using internet today there are there
 

313
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,510
are using internet today there are there
are like millions of applications which

314
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
are like millions of applications which
 

315
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,550
are like millions of applications which
which which the internet is is uh

316
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
which which the internet is is uh
 

317
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,870
which which the internet is is uh
um is used for

318
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
um is used for
 

319
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,110
um is used for
so what kind of requirements would we

320
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
so what kind of requirements would we
 

321
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,990
so what kind of requirements would we
need to talk about here if we want if we

322
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
need to talk about here if we want if we
 

323
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,550
need to talk about here if we want if we
want this i will share my screen now

324
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
want this i will share my screen now
 

325
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,550
want this i will share my screen now
for a second

326
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
for a second
 

327
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,909
for a second
and uh

328
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
and uh
 

329
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,469
and uh
let's see i just put one it's not even

330
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
let's see i just put one it's not even
 

331
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,590
let's see i just put one it's not even
slight

332
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
slight
 

333
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,270
slight
um

334
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
um
 

335
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,350
um
to do that

336
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360
to do that
 

337
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,390
to do that
so

338
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
so
 

339
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,189
so
i put four kind of four properties of

340
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
i put four kind of four properties of
 

341
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,990
i put four kind of four properties of
this of this back one

342
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000

 

343
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,270

it need to be

344
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
it need to be
 

345
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,230
it need to be
fast it need to be secure it needs to be

346
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
fast it need to be secure it needs to be
 

347
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,070
fast it need to be secure it needs to be
something we called

348
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
something we called
 

349
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,950
something we called
valuable and sustainable

350
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
valuable and sustainable
 

351
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,749
valuable and sustainable
available right sustainable

352
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759

353
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,870
available right sustainable
um

354
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
um
 

355
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,350
um
i will briefly go for all of this

356
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
i will briefly go for all of this
 

357
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,510
i will briefly go for all of this
um and i believe that all of them are

358
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520
um and i believe that all of them are
 

359
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,629
um and i believe that all of them are
required

360
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
required
 

361
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,430
required
right so

362
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440

 

363
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,870

so first of all it should be fast and

364
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
so first of all it should be fast and
 

365
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,430
so first of all it should be fast and
fast of course is a kind of

366
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
fast of course is a kind of
 

367
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,950
fast of course is a kind of
not precise word but um let's

368
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
not precise word but um let's
 

369
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,029
not precise word but um let's
just break it up so it need to be low

370
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039
just break it up so it need to be low
 

371
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,270
just break it up so it need to be low
latency and by low latency i mean if you

372
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
latency and by low latency i mean if you
 

373
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,870
latency and by low latency i mean if you
go to like social network and you

374
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
go to like social network and you
 

375
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,029
go to like social network and you
refresh a page or you put a post you

376
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
refresh a page or you put a post you
 

377
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,749
refresh a page or you put a post you
don't expect that you know um post to

378
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
don't expect that you know um post to
 

379
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,950
don't expect that you know um post to
appear in

380
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
appear in
 

381
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,110
appear in
in an hour

382
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
in an hour
 

383
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,430
in an hour
or and even in 20 seconds you you like

384
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,440
or and even in 20 seconds you you like
 

385
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,270
or and even in 20 seconds you you like
hit the button you wait one two three

386
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
hit the button you wait one two three
 

387
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,270
hit the button you wait one two three
well that's it i mean that's more or

388
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
well that's it i mean that's more or
 

389
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,830
well that's it i mean that's more or
less the span of user uh kind of um

390
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
less the span of user uh kind of um
 

391
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,670
less the span of user uh kind of um
ready to wait for this to appear on the

392
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
ready to wait for this to appear on the
 

393
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,189
ready to wait for this to appear on the
on the website so it should be really

394
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
on the website so it should be really
 

395
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,430
on the website so it should be really
low latency stuff

396
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
low latency stuff
 

397
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,790
low latency stuff
then it should have a very high

398
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
then it should have a very high
 

399
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,469
then it should have a very high
throughput because like there are a lot

400
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
throughput because like there are a lot
 

401
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,029
throughput because like there are a lot
of these users potentially who would you

402
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
of these users potentially who would you
 

403
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,830
of these users potentially who would you
know want to do that simultaneously

404
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
know want to do that simultaneously
 

405
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,790
know want to do that simultaneously
so

406
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
so
 

407
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,270
so
we talk about let's say twitter

408
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
we talk about let's say twitter
 

409
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,070
we talk about let's say twitter
right

410
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080
right
 

411
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,150
right
so twitter has like i don't know 20 30

412
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
so twitter has like i don't know 20 30
 

413
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,550
so twitter has like i don't know 20 30

there on their feed

416
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
there on their feed
 

417
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,950
there on their feed
around the world and uh

00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
around the world and uh
 

419
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,710
around the world and uh
and they on the high peaks like it can

420
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
and they on the high peaks like it can
 

421
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,950
and they on the high peaks like it can
have to like what 60

422
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
have to like what 60
 

423
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,230
have to like what 60
70

424
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
70
 

425
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,390

000 tps

426
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
000 tps
 

427
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,909
000 tps
right

428
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
right
 

429
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,430
right
and it should be infinitely scalable

430
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
and it should be infinitely scalable
 

431
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,510
and it should be infinitely scalable
because if i want tomorrow to develop

432
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
because if i want tomorrow to develop
 

433
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,430
because if i want tomorrow to develop
new application i can define i'm an

434
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
new application i can define i'm an
 

435
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,749
new application i can define i'm an
entrepreneur or developer i wrote some

436
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:43,759
entrepreneur or developer i wrote some
 

437
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,029
entrepreneur or developer i wrote some
application and there are millions of

438
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
application and there are millions of
 

439
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,550
application and there are millions of
users suddenly want to use it like i

440
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
users suddenly want to use it like i
 

441
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,150
users suddenly want to use it like i
wrote the tik tok or whatever and there

442
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,160
wrote the tik tok or whatever and there
 

443
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,150
wrote the tik tok or whatever and there
are millions of users want to use it

444
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
are millions of users want to use it
 

445
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,390
are millions of users want to use it
well this network should scale with that

446
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
well this network should scale with that
 

447
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,909
well this network should scale with that
right so it should be like almost

448
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:53,919
right so it should be like almost
 

449
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,510
right so it should be like almost
infinitely scalable because we don't

450
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520
infinitely scalable because we don't
 

451
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,110
infinitely scalable because we don't
know how many of this application would

452
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
know how many of this application would
 

453
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,430
know how many of this application would
appear

454
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440
appear
 

455
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,749
appear
now then it should be really secure

456
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
now then it should be really secure
 

457
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,150
now then it should be really secure
because if we don't do that secure and

458
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
because if we don't do that secure and
 

459
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,430
because if we don't do that secure and
i'm not talking about only financial

460
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
i'm not talking about only financial
 

461
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,350
i'm not talking about only financial
first it's a very bad like if you have a

462
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
first it's a very bad like if you have a
 

463
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,550
first it's a very bad like if you have a
financial application which is not

464
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
financial application which is not
 

465
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,950
financial application which is not
secure but even if i'm not talking about

466
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960
secure but even if i'm not talking about
 

467
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,469
secure but even if i'm not talking about
financial application

468
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
financial application
 

469
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,469
financial application
just you know you're putting all your

470
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
just you know you're putting all your
 

471
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,550
just you know you're putting all your
data and we know that

472
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
data and we know that
 

473
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,110
data and we know that
right now you put all your data in the

474
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
right now you put all your data in the
 

475
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,749
right now you put all your data in the
hands of like google or whatever

476
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:21,759
hands of like google or whatever
 

477
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,350
hands of like google or whatever
and um

478
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
and um
 

479
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,990
and um
and and we and of course that is exactly

480
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
and and we and of course that is exactly
 

481
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,710
and and we and of course that is exactly
the power of the of their monopolization

482
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,720
the power of the of their monopolization
 

483
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,950
the power of the of their monopolization
because like they have this data now

484
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
because like they have this data now
 

485
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,509
because like they have this data now
they can use that data to sell your data

486
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
they can use that data to sell your data
 

487
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,509
they can use that data to sell your data
basically and so on and so forth

488
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
basically and so on and so forth
 

489
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,670
basically and so on and so forth
so user need to be in control of of its

490
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
so user need to be in control of of its
 

491
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,350
so user need to be in control of of its
data if we want really to decentralize

492
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
data if we want really to decentralize
 

493
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,350
data if we want really to decentralize
the internet

494
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
the internet
 

495
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,430
the internet
in order to do that you need to be

496
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
in order to do that you need to be
 

497
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,829
in order to do that you need to be
secure like there's no of course

498
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
secure like there's no of course
 

499
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,990
secure like there's no of course
arguing about that

500
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
arguing about that
 

501
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,870
arguing about that
what we call millable is is is something

502
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
what we call millable is is is something
 

503
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,829
what we call millable is is is something
nasim taleb called

scientific
 

507
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,829
scientific
it's um

508
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
it's um
 

509
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,230
it's um
it's basically what happens to

510
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
it's basically what happens to
 

511
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,509
it's basically what happens to
um

512
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
um
 

513
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,790
um
if you want

514
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
if you want
 

515
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,870
if you want
this system to like say you want to

516
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
this system to like say you want to
 

517
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,550
this system to like say you want to
upgrade this system

518
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,560
upgrade this system
 

519
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,389
upgrade this system
right

520
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
right
 

521
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,750
right
who is deciding what need to be upgraded

522
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
who is deciding what need to be upgraded
 

523
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,710
who is deciding what need to be upgraded
and and should we put your code on it or

524
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
and and should we put your code on it or
 

525
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,949
and and should we put your code on it or
not right if there are rules of the

526
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
not right if there are rules of the
 

527
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,990
not right if there are rules of the
protocol um who decide

528
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000
protocol um who decide
 

529
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,670
protocol um who decide
how this rules changes if we need to

530
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
how this rules changes if we need to
 

531
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,710
how this rules changes if we need to
change them

532
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:20,720
change them
 

533
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,550
change them
and we need to change them to adopt

534
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
and we need to change them to adopt
 

535
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,870
and we need to change them to adopt
simply for you know future growth or

536
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
simply for you know future growth or
 

537
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,670
simply for you know future growth or
needs or bugs change whatever

538
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
needs or bugs change whatever
 

539
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,990
needs or bugs change whatever
and if you look even at the bitcoin how

540
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
and if you look even at the bitcoin how
 

541
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,710
and if you look even at the bitcoin how
they do that

542
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:32,720

 

543
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,990

um

544
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
um
 

545
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,790
um
the repository where bitcoin repository

546
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
the repository where bitcoin repository
 

547
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,910
the repository where bitcoin repository
code is centralized today

548
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
code is centralized today
 

549
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,630
code is centralized today
so

550
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
so
 

551
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,829
so
presumably it's just it's just not

552
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:43,839
presumably it's just it's just not
 

553
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,230
presumably it's just it's just not
it's just not decentralized enough of

554
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
it's just not decentralized enough of
 

555
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,829
it's just not decentralized enough of
course there are like governance

556
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
course there are like governance
 

557
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,910
course there are like governance
structures which are like community

558
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
structures which are like community
 

559
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,670
structures which are like community
governance structures that may be

560
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
governance structures that may be
 

561
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,190
governance structures that may be
decentralized

562
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
decentralized
 

563
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,990
decentralized
um

564
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
um
 

565
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,630
um
but until the point where you make all

566
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
but until the point where you make all
 

567
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,590
but until the point where you make all
of it decentralized and also in such a

568
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
of it decentralized and also in such a
 

569
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,790
of it decentralized and also in such a
way where

570
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
way where
 

571
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,750
way where
um this decentralization kind of

572
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:03,760
um this decentralization kind of
 

573
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,269
um this decentralization kind of
is upgradeable

574
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
is upgradeable
 

575
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,230
is upgradeable
meaning if if tomorrow community changes

576
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
meaning if if tomorrow community changes
 

577
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,069
meaning if if tomorrow community changes
the network should not stop and the

578
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
the network should not stop and the
 

579
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,230
the network should not stop and the
network development shouldn't stop right

580
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,240
network development shouldn't stop right
 

581
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,790
network development shouldn't stop right
so you need some kind of rules

582
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,800
so you need some kind of rules
 

583
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,509
so you need some kind of rules
governance rules which would be which

584
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
governance rules which would be which
 

585
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,949
governance rules which would be which
would be flexible which would be

586
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
would be flexible which would be
 

587
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,910
would be flexible which would be
anti-fragile

588
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
anti-fragile
 

589
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,750
anti-fragile
and the last thing of course you need it

590
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
and the last thing of course you need it
 

591
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,350
and the last thing of course you need it
to be sustainable because if it's not

592
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
to be sustainable because if it's not
 

593
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,190
to be sustainable because if it's not
sustainable nobody will support it right

594
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
sustainable nobody will support it right
 

595
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,030
sustainable nobody will support it right
so if you if you have a validators on

596
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
so if you if you have a validators on
 

597
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,030
so if you if you have a validators on
the network you have you have more

598
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
the network you have you have more
 

599
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,910
the network you have you have more
miners whatever um right you need an

600
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
miners whatever um right you need an
 

601
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,829
miners whatever um right you need an
economic system

602
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
economic system
 

603
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,750
economic system
where um

604
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
where um
 

605
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,829
where um
doesn't matter what happens

606
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
doesn't matter what happens
 

607
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,829
doesn't matter what happens
it will always be profitable to to run

608
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
it will always be profitable to to run
 

609
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,150
it will always be profitable to to run
your network uh of course if the users

610
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
your network uh of course if the users
 

611
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,829
your network uh of course if the users
are there if the users are not there

612
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:47,839
are there if the users are not there
 

613
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:48,790
are there if the users are not there
then

614
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
then
 

615
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,069
then
yeah well

616
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:50,079
yeah well
 

617
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,069
yeah well
nobody needs the network

618
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
nobody needs the network
 

619
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,910
nobody needs the network
right

620
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
right
 

621
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,630
right
and the last point is it should be

622
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
and the last point is it should be
 

623
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,110
and the last point is it should be
sustainable in a way that where the new

624
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,120
sustainable in a way that where the new
 

625
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,550
sustainable in a way that where the new
entrepreneurs

626
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
entrepreneurs
 

627
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,790
entrepreneurs
like developers want to join the network

628
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
like developers want to join the network
 

629
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,550
like developers want to join the network
do something on that it should be it

630
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
do something on that it should be it
 

631
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,990
do something on that it should be it
should provide some incentive for them

632
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,000
should provide some incentive for them
 

633
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,590
should provide some incentive for them
to do that

634
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
to do that
 

635
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,350
to do that
and so i think that

636
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
and so i think that
 

637
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,110
and so i think that
more or less this is the framework this

638
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,120
more or less this is the framework this
 

639
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,150
more or less this is the framework this
for me

640
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
for me
 

641
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,870
for me
this is the frame of for like to

642
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
this is the frame of for like to
 

643
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,990
this is the frame of for like to
building

644
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
building
 

645
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,949
building
the

646
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:16,959
the
 

647
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,790
the
this decentralized internet now if you

648
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:18,800
this decentralized internet now if you
 

649
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,190
this decentralized internet now if you
look today and just

650
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
look today and just
 

651
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,949
look today and just
take that framework

652
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
take that framework
 

653
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,509
take that framework
and apply it to any blockchain that you

654
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
and apply it to any blockchain that you
 

655
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,630
and apply it to any blockchain that you
know

656
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:26,640
know
 

657
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,670
know
today and you will see very quickly

658
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
today and you will see very quickly
 

659
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,550
today and you will see very quickly
that

660
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,560
that
 

661
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,590
that
there are no blockchain today which

662
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,600
there are no blockchain today which
 

663
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,710
there are no blockchain today which
actually

664
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
actually
 

665
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,389
actually
um

666
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
um
 

667
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,150
um
fits all these points

668
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
fits all these points
 

669
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,590
fits all these points
right so

670
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
right so
 

671
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,030
right so
there is simply no

672
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040
there is simply no
 

673
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,670
there is simply no
no protocol today which allows for

674
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
no protocol today which allows for
 

675
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,829
no protocol today which allows for
creation of decentralized internet yet

676
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839

 

677
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,150

and they all of all of the protocols

678
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
and they all of all of the protocols
 

679
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,790
and they all of all of the protocols
they have like their

680
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
they have like their
 

681
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,350
they have like their
good side their strong side something

682
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:55,360
good side their strong side something
 

683
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,430
good side their strong side something
that they do really well like for

684
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
that they do really well like for
 

685
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,269
that they do really well like for
example you like there is a huge

686
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
example you like there is a huge
 

687
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,069
example you like there is a huge
community of developers on ethereum

688
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
community of developers on ethereum
 

689
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:02,949
community of developers on ethereum
and

690
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
and
 

691
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,710
and
you know they write a lot of solidity

692
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:04,720
you know they write a lot of solidity
 

693
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,110
you know they write a lot of solidity
smart contracts

694
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120
smart contracts
 

695
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,710
smart contracts
more or less they all of course copy

696
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
more or less they all of course copy
 

697
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,190
more or less they all of course copy
pasting but that's not the point so you

698
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
pasting but that's not the point so you
 

699
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,670
pasting but that's not the point so you
have this a lot so they like

700
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
have this a lot so they like
 

701
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,550
have this a lot so they like
the ethereum to teach us or

702
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
the ethereum to teach us or
 

703
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,590
the ethereum to teach us or
taught us that you can you can write

704
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
taught us that you can you can write
 

705
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,750
taught us that you can you can write
applications on the blockchain

706
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
applications on the blockchain
 

707
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,870
applications on the blockchain
but um

708
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
but um
 

709
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,910
but um
the network itself is just not

710
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920
the network itself is just not
 

711
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,190
the network itself is just not
scalable at all so when we thought about

712
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
scalable at all so when we thought about
 

713
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,150
scalable at all so when we thought about
that framework um

714
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
that framework um
 

715
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,949
that framework um
we thought that this is the design that

716
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959
we thought that this is the design that
 

717
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,190
we thought that this is the design that
goals that we have right so

718
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
goals that we have right so
 

719
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,190
goals that we have right so
and of course i'm not going to talk now

720
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200
and of course i'm not going to talk now
 

721
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,230
and of course i'm not going to talk now
about how how we tackle that and that's

722
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
about how how we tackle that and that's
 

723
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,310
about how how we tackle that and that's
not the point when you can check it from

724
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
not the point when you can check it from
 

725
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,750
not the point when you can check it from
freetown

726
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
freetown
 

727
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,990
freetown
node organs and technical papers and but

728
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000
node organs and technical papers and but
 

729
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,110
node organs and technical papers and but
there are

730
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
there are
 

731
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,269
there are
of course all basically many blockchains

732
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
of course all basically many blockchains
 

733
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,030
of course all basically many blockchains
trying to solve that

734
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,040
trying to solve that
 

735
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,069
trying to solve that
problem

736
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
problem
 

737
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,910
problem
um of like but

738
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
um of like but
 

739
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,990
um of like but
again you need to talk

740
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,000
again you need to talk
 

741
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,829
again you need to talk
about this whole complex of these

742
00:12:59,829 --> 00:12:59,839
about this whole complex of these
 

743
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,790
about this whole complex of these
problems because if you just solve one

744
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:02,800
problems because if you just solve one
 

745
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,069
problems because if you just solve one
you will not build a centralized

746
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
you will not build a centralized
 

747
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,590
you will not build a centralized
internet you may build decentralized

748
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
internet you may build decentralized
 

749
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,750
internet you may build decentralized
finance yes but you won't build

750
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
finance yes but you won't build
 

751
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,910
finance yes but you won't build
decentralized internet

752
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
decentralized internet
 

753
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,430
decentralized internet
nor a backbone for decentralized

754
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,440
nor a backbone for decentralized
 

755
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,389
nor a backbone for decentralized
internet um so for example you can have

756
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
internet um so for example you can have
 

757
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,629
internet um so for example you can have
a very like fast blockchain fast meaning

758
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
a very like fast blockchain fast meaning
 

759
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,590
a very like fast blockchain fast meaning
like low latency high throughput

760
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:19,600
like low latency high throughput
 

761
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,069
like low latency high throughput
but if you don't have governance um

762
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
but if you don't have governance um
 

763
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,910
but if you don't have governance um
which is which is decentralized and you

764
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
which is which is decentralized and you
 

765
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,829
which is which is decentralized and you
don't have it's a sustainable economy

766
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
don't have it's a sustainable economy
 

767
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,550
don't have it's a sustainable economy
then that just won't work

768
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
then that just won't work
 

769
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,190
then that just won't work
now when we talk about our design of

770
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
now when we talk about our design of
 

771
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,430
now when we talk about our design of
course with these goals

772
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,440
course with these goals
 

773
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,110
course with these goals
we kind of

774
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
we kind of
 

775
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,870
we kind of
it changes a lot the perspective of what

776
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
it changes a lot the perspective of what
 

777
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,189
it changes a lot the perspective of what
you're trying to do for example like

778
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:39,199
you're trying to do for example like
 

779
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,590
you're trying to do for example like
if you if you take one chain solution

780
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,600
if you if you take one chain solution
 

781
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,750
if you if you take one chain solution
and you just built very fast chain but

782
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760
and you just built very fast chain but
 

783
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,990
and you just built very fast chain but
you will still have um scalability

784
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
you will still have um scalability
 

785
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,870
you will still have um scalability
issues because it's not infinite then

786
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:48,880
issues because it's not infinite then
 

787
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,269
issues because it's not infinite then
you can then you quickly realize okay

788
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:51,279
you can then you quickly realize okay
 

789
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,550
you can then you quickly realize okay
you can build a very fine um order book

790
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,560
you can build a very fine um order book
 

791
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,670
you can build a very fine um order book
uh kind of um decentralized exchange but

792
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:57,680
uh kind of um decentralized exchange but
 

793
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,829
uh kind of um decentralized exchange but
that's about it and because you will hit

794
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
that's about it and because you will hit
 

795
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,750
that's about it and because you will hit
the limit upper limit of your of your

796
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:01,760
the limit upper limit of your of your
 

797
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,470
the limit upper limit of your of your
scalability which will be i don't know

798
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:04,480
scalability which will be i don't know
 

799
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,949
scalability which will be i don't know
even few hundred thousand tps but then

800
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:06,959
even few hundred thousand tps but then
 

801
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,269
even few hundred thousand tps but then
it stops so how would you do the next

802
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:09,279
it stops so how would you do the next
 

803
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,509
it stops so how would you do the next
one if you do if a developer comes to

804
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:11,519
one if you do if a developer comes to
 

805
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,710
one if you do if a developer comes to
you and say okay i have another

806
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
you and say okay i have another
 

807
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,629
you and say okay i have another
application and i need another million

808
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
application and i need another million
 

809
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,189
application and i need another million
transaction per second more or less

810
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199
transaction per second more or less
 

811
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,310
transaction per second more or less
what you're going to do

812
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,320
what you're going to do
 

813
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,949
what you're going to do
[Music]

814
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:20,959
[Music]
 

815
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:21,790
[Music]
so um

816
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:21,800
so um
 

817
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,750
so um
[Music]

818
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
[Music]
 

819
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,710
[Music]
so so we need this infinite scalability

820
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
so so we need this infinite scalability
 

821
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,990
so so we need this infinite scalability
and the infinite scalability you can

822
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,000
and the infinite scalability you can
 

823
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,189
and the infinite scalability you can
only build

824
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:29,199
only build
 

825
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,350
only build
with well it's you can't even build it

826
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360
with well it's you can't even build it
 

827
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,269
with well it's you can't even build it
with sharding

828
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
with sharding
 

829
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,590
with sharding
because you will build just

830
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,600
because you will build just
 

831
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,629
because you will build just
um

832
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:36,639
um
 

833
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,030
um
scalability but you won't you won't do

834
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
scalability but you won't you won't do
 

835
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,590
scalability but you won't you won't do
that fast and because like if you just

836
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
that fast and because like if you just
 

837
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,990
that fast and because like if you just
shard every all the time

838
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
shard every all the time
 

839
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,030
shard every all the time
it won't be low latency for example

840
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
it won't be low latency for example
 

841
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,870
it won't be low latency for example
so there are compromises in each step

842
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
so there are compromises in each step
 

843
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,030
so there are compromises in each step
and if you think about security for

844
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,040
and if you think about security for
 

845
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,110
and if you think about security for
example if you share it a lot

846
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
example if you share it a lot
 

847
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,949
example if you share it a lot
and you don't have a consensus which

848
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
and you don't have a consensus which
 

849
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,110
and you don't have a consensus which
which provides security guarantees which

850
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
which provides security guarantees which
 

851
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,189
which provides security guarantees which
are you know

852
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
are you know
 

853
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,030
are you know
built for sharding if you don't solve

854
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040
built for sharding if you don't solve
 

855
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,710
built for sharding if you don't solve
that the sharding the security

856
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
that the sharding the security
 

857
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,910
that the sharding the security
guarantees for charging which is really

858
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
guarantees for charging which is really
 

859
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,509
guarantees for charging which is really
hard

860
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
hard
 

861
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,350
hard
then then you cannot have sharding

862
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
then then you cannot have sharding
 

863
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,350
then then you cannot have sharding
because you won't have security right or

864
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360
because you won't have security right or
 

865
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,509
because you won't have security right or
you simply jeopardize the user security

866
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
you simply jeopardize the user security
 

867
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,590
you simply jeopardize the user security
if you have sharding and i'm talking

868
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
if you have sharding and i'm talking
 

869
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,509
if you have sharding and i'm talking
about layer 2 solutions for example and

870
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519
about layer 2 solutions for example and
 

871
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,870
about layer 2 solutions for example and
all that

872
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
all that
 

873
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,350
all that
and you can build layer 2 layer 3 layer

874
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,360
and you can build layer 2 layer 3 layer
 

875
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,350
and you can build layer 2 layer 3 layer
4 what you have today more or less kind

876
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
4 what you have today more or less kind
 

877
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,230
4 what you have today more or less kind
of a solution but the problem is that on

878
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
of a solution but the problem is that on
 

879
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,750
of a solution but the problem is that on
if you go for all these layers for the

880
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:25,760
if you go for all these layers for the
 

881
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,150
if you go for all these layers for the
user and i'm talking web3 which okay so

882
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160
user and i'm talking web3 which okay so
 

883
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,710
user and i'm talking web3 which okay so
let's say layer one um network which

884
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
let's say layer one um network which
 

885
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,389
let's say layer one um network which
provides security currencies layer two

886
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
provides security currencies layer two
 

887
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,870
provides security currencies layer two
network which provides the scalability

888
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:34,880
network which provides the scalability
 

889
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,389
network which provides the scalability
layer three now which which provides

890
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
layer three now which which provides
 

891
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,910
layer three now which which provides
like a user interface we're going

892
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
like a user interface we're going
 

893
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,230
like a user interface we're going
through this whole web three stack if

894
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
through this whole web three stack if
 

895
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,350
through this whole web three stack if
you just connect all these pieces

896
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
you just connect all these pieces
 

897
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,670
you just connect all these pieces
together

898
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680
together
 

899
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,389
together
if you hit a button

900
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,399
if you hit a button
 

901
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,749
if you hit a button
it will take you like i don't know how

902
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:47,759
it will take you like i don't know how
 

903
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,550
it will take you like i don't know how
much time like it's it's it's not you

904
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
much time like it's it's it's not you
 

905
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,189
much time like it's it's it's not you
simply cannot

906
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:53,199
simply cannot
 

907
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,749
simply cannot
you need to think of a system that would

908
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
you need to think of a system that would
 

909
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,509
you need to think of a system that would
have all these components tied together

910
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:57,519
have all these components tied together
 

911
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,509
have all these components tied together
in one kind of network

912
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
in one kind of network
 

913
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,189
in one kind of network
layer one

914
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
layer one
 

915
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,430
layer one
and because without that you you simply

916
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
and because without that you you simply
 

917
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,990
and because without that you you simply
cannot hit all these design goals

918
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
cannot hit all these design goals
 

919
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,550
cannot hit all these design goals
just they're very simple um kind of

920
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
just they're very simple um kind of
 

921
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,389
just they're very simple um kind of
stuff right

922
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:10,399
stuff right
 

923
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,269
stuff right
um

924
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:13,279

 

925
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,710

then and then you have all this

926
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:14,720
then and then you have all this
 

927
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,310
then and then you have all this
decentralized governance and in the

928
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
decentralized governance and in the
 

929
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,430
decentralized governance and in the
economy in which i i don't even want to

930
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,440
economy in which i i don't even want to
 

931
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,590
economy in which i i don't even want to
start to talk about now because we don't

932
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:21,600
start to talk about now because we don't
 

933
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,870
start to talk about now because we don't
have time for that

934
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:22,880
have time for that
 

935
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,829
have time for that
so

936
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:23,839
so
 

937
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,269
so
anyway

938
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
anyway
 

939
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,269
anyway
just for a conclusion

940
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:27,279
just for a conclusion
 

941
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,030
just for a conclusion
this is the framework i'm thinking about

942
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040
this is the framework i'm thinking about
 

943
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,790
this is the framework i'm thinking about
when i'm thinking about like the next

944
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
when i'm thinking about like the next
 

945
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,470
when i'm thinking about like the next
generation blockchains

946
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
generation blockchains
 

947
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,150
generation blockchains
this was our design goals when we

948
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
this was our design goals when we
 

949
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,710
this was our design goals when we
created ours and i think that you need

950
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
created ours and i think that you need
 

951
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,269
created ours and i think that you need
to check every well i check every

952
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:39,279
to check every well i check every
 

953
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,189
to check every well i check every
blockchain or every kind of

954
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:41,199
blockchain or every kind of
 

955
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,269
blockchain or every kind of
infrastructure solution

956
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:43,279
infrastructure solution
 

957
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,670
infrastructure solution
um in the blockchain space today against

958
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
um in the blockchain space today against
 

959
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,910
um in the blockchain space today against
these principles and if it doesn't fit

960
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
these principles and if it doesn't fit
 

961
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,150
these principles and if it doesn't fit
then i say okay fine it has a limited

962
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160
then i say okay fine it has a limited
 

963
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,509
then i say okay fine it has a limited
like scope of that or that which is fine

964
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:53,519
like scope of that or that which is fine
 

965
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,550
like scope of that or that which is fine
i guess

966
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560
i guess
 

967
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,350
i guess
um but well our goal was to build a

968
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
um but well our goal was to build a
 

969
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,110
um but well our goal was to build a
decentralized internet because we think

970
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
decentralized internet because we think
 

971
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,030
decentralized internet because we think
that there is a problem with the current

972
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,040
that there is a problem with the current
 

973
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,990
that there is a problem with the current
one

974
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
one
 

975
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,670
one
thank you very much

976
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
thank you very much
 

977
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,799
thank you very much
