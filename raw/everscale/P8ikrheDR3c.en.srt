thing
 

181
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,029
thing
but which allows very

182
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:05,039
but which allows very
 

183
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,750
but which allows very
non-complicated user experience

steps
 

273
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,470
steps
these steps

274
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:48,480
these steps
 

275
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,549
these steps
are there to deploy all the accounts

276
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:50,559
are there to deploy all the accounts
 

277
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,549
are there to deploy all the accounts
that are necessary accounts and index

know
uh how many of these wallets has been

286
00:31:58,789 --> 00:31:58,799
uh how many of these wallets has been
 

287
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,750
uh how many of these wallets has been
deployed to in order to manage that it

288
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
deployed to in order to manage that it
 

289
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,470

you have the market on the influence but

300
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,200
you have the market on the influence but
 

301
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,789
you have the market on the influence but
obviously you can have many of the you

302
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:14,799
obviously you can have many of the you
 

303
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,070
obviously you can have many of the you
will have many of the currencies here

304
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,080
will have many of the currencies here
 

305
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,470
will have many of the currencies here
and in order to manage all that

306
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:20,480
and in order to manage all that
 

307
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,310
and in order to manage all that
you need to deploy a lot of a lot of

308
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,320
you need to deploy a lot of a lot of
 

309
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,549
you need to deploy a lot of a lot of
stuff a lot of indexes and and so on and

310
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:24,559
stuff a lot of indexes and and so on and
 

311
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,750
stuff a lot of indexes and and so on and
so forth so

312
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:25,760
so forth so
 

313
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,590
so forth so
therefore it's it's currently it will be

314
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:27,600
therefore it's it's currently it will be
 

315
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,509
therefore it's it's currently it will be
refactored this debate so it will be

316
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:29,519
refactored this debate so it will be
 

317
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,630
refactored this debate so it will be
easier

318
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:30,640
easier
 

319
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,230
easier
but but right now you just go through

320
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,240
but but right now you just go through
 

321
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,350
but but right now you just go through
the steps

322
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:33,360
the steps
 

323
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,669
the steps
there so once you are once you are done

324
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:35,679
there so once you are once you are done
 

325
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,909
there so once you are once you are done
and yeah we know that there is a lot of

326
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:37,919
and yeah we know that there is a lot of
 

327
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,070
and yeah we know that there is a lot of
like unnecessary complexities where they

328
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,080
like unnecessary complexities where they
 

329
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,350
like unnecessary complexities where they

332
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,120
to deposit and not very intuitive we're
 

333
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,590
to deposit and not very intuitive we're
working on making this much simpler this

334
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:47,600
working on making this much simpler this

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,269
three
so you have tokens right now like evers

348
00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:01,279
so you have tokens right now like evers
 

349
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,590
so you have tokens right now like evers
and about some flex already

350
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:03,600
and about some flex already
 

351
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,430
and about some flex already
and you have also the the

352
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:05,440
and you have also the the
 

353
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,310
and you have also the the
the native evers on each of these tip

354
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:08,320
the native evers on each of these tip
 

355
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,789
the native evers on each of these tip
three these are just to pay the fees

356
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:10,799
three these are just to pay the fees
 

357
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,230
three these are just to pay the fees
right so you have to remember that's

358
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,240
right so you have to remember that's
 

359
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,549
right so you have to remember that's
that was i was making the mistake by

360
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:14,559
that was i was making the mistake by
 

361
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,389
that was i was making the mistake by
deploying by depositing hundred thousand

362
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:18,399
deploying by depositing hundred thousand
 

363
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,070
deploying by depositing hundred thousand
and because of this debt when i used it

364
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,080
and because of this debt when i used it
 

365
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,909
and because of this debt when i used it
first time i also didn't know what it

366
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:21,919
first time i also didn't know what it
 

367
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,710
first time i also didn't know what it
all means so yeah that that happens

368
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:24,720
all means so yeah that that happens
 

369
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,630
all means so yeah that that happens
but anyway you can destroy the account

370
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:26,640
but anyway you can destroy the account
 

371
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,230
but anyway you can destroy the account
you can you can take this money back so

372
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,240
you can you can take this money back so
 

373
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,389
you can you can take this money back so
it's not you know it's not stuck there

374
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:30,399
it's not you know it's not stuck there
 

375
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,549
it's not you know it's not stuck there
forever but nevertheless

376
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:32,559
forever but nevertheless
 

377
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,110
forever but nevertheless
so these are these are the keys now

378
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:35,120
so these are these are the keys now
 

379
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,029
so these are these are the keys now
flex will not

383
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,590
use
a native token so it all wrapped but we

384
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:41,600

678
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:03,280
be executed on the bots so in a way it's
 

679
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,829
be executed on the bots so in a way it's
the same like the bots will see whatever

680
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:05,839
the same like the bots will see whatever
 

681
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:06,950
the same like the bots will see whatever
you see

682
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:06,960
you see
 

683
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,950
you see
and it will just execute that

684
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:08,960
and it will just execute that
 

685
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,630
and it will just execute that
automatically the logic that you can do

686
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:10,640
automatically the logic that you can do
 

687
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,069
automatically the logic that you can do
manually okay so so nothing fancy and we

688
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:14,079
manually okay so so nothing fancy and we
 

689
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,310
manually okay so so nothing fancy and we
will do limit orders quite simply

690
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:16,320
will do limit orders quite simply
 

691
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,940
will do limit orders quite simply
but um

692
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:16,950
but um
 

693
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,950
but um

[Music]
 

695
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,109
[Music]
but right now it's uh the more

696
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:21,119
but right now it's uh the more
 

697
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,430
but right now it's uh the more
interesting types of orders are good

698
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:23,440
interesting types of orders are good
 

699
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,589
interesting types of orders are good
good until executed

700
00:39:25,589 --> 00:39:25,599
good until executed
 

701
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,670
good until executed
and stuff like that which which will be

702
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:27,680
and stuff like that which which will be
 

703
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,230
and stuff like that which which will be
quite tricky to implement but we will do

704
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,240
quite tricky to implement but we will do
 

705
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,150
quite tricky to implement but we will do
that as well so right now okay

706
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,160
that as well so right now okay
 

707
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,069
that as well so right now okay

741
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,550

uh it will be fixed today
if it's not fixed already

746

image of the cancel if you execute an

752
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:24,800
image of the cancel if you execute an
 

753
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,230
image of the cancel if you execute an
order that will be it if you don't have

754
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:28,240
order that will be it if you don't have
 

755
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,589
order that will be it if you don't have
the full order

756
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:29,599
the full order
 

757
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,710
the full order
fulfillment it will execute the taker

758
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:32,720
fulfillment it will execute the taker
 

759
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,349
fulfillment it will execute the taker
order on the part that it has

760
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:35,359
order on the part that it has
 

761
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,829
order on the part that it has
as it is possible to fulfill and then

762
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:37,839
as it is possible to fulfill and then
 

763
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,150
as it is possible to fulfill and then
the rest will be left as a maker order

764
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,160
the rest will be left as a maker order
 

765
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,150
the rest will be left as a maker order
so it's like partial maker partial taker

766
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,160
so it's like partial maker partial taker
 

767
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,349
so it's like partial maker partial taker

well um you can you have two ways to

850
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:20,880
well um you can you have two ways to
 

851
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,550
well um you can you have two ways to
implement strategies

852
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:22,560
implement strategies
 

853
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,390
implement strategies
uh one way is through

854
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:24,400
uh one way is through
 

855
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,750
uh one way is through
uh debots

856
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:25,760
uh debots
 

857
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,790
uh debots
like or or external apis is what the way

858
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:28,800
like or or external apis is what the way
 

859
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,470
like or or external apis is what the way
you want it doesn't matter

860
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:30,480
you want it doesn't matter
 

861
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,670
you want it doesn't matter
which which will be executed by your

862
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:31,680
which which will be executed by your
 

863
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,630
which which will be executed by your
server

864
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:32,640
server
 

865
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,910
server
that's one

866
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:33,920
that's one
 

867
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,790
that's one
uh simple kind of solution to that if

868
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:36,800
uh simple kind of solution to that if
 

869
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,589
uh simple kind of solution to that if
you want to decentralize market maker

870
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:39,599
you want to decentralize market maker
 

871
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,670
you want to decentralize market maker
then you must execute it the way we

872
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:41,680
then you must execute it the way we
 

873
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,510
then you must execute it the way we
provide the sample for imo so you can

874
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:43,520
provide the sample for imo so you can
 

875
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,390
provide the sample for imo so you can
take our ammo use it or or change it

you will need to can amms are complex
 

883
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,750
you will need to can amms are complex
you will need to understand how it works

884
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:55,760
you will need to understand how it works
 

885
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,870
you will need to understand how it works
in order to like write something or they

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,670
question is
i'm thinking about the

910
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:27,680
i'm thinking about the
 

911
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,470
i'm thinking about the
uh

912

no
this is something that is um you will

1006
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:19,520
this is something that is um you will
 

1007
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,349
this is something that is um you will
have to develop yourself if you want not

1008
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:21,359
have to develop yourself if you want not
 

1009
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,829

to use cloud because this is the cloud

1010
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:23,839
to use cloud because this is the cloud
 

1011
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,829
to use cloud because this is the cloud
uh cloud did a lot of efforts and

1012
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:25,839
uh cloud did a lot of efforts and
 

1013
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,990
uh cloud did a lot of efforts and
supporting this and uh they probably

1014
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:28,000
supporting this and uh they probably
 

1015
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,750
supporting this and uh they probably
want to charge for that

1016
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:29,760
want to charge for that
 

1017
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,390

um so if you're okay so you can use our

1018
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:32,400
um so if you're okay so you can use our
 

1019
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,589
um so if you're okay so you can use our
you can

1020
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:33,599
you can
 

1021
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,270
you can
yeah there is no place to open source

1022
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:35,280
yeah there is no place to open source
 

1023
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,150
yeah there is no place to open source
that

1024
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:36,160
that
 

1025
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,069
that
obviously you can do that yourself you

1026
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:38,079
obviously you can do that yourself you
 

1027
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,990
obviously you can do that yourself you
can take the server and optimize the

1028
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,000
can take the server and optimize the
 

1029
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,390
can take the server and optimize the
queries and so on for what you need to

1030
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:42,400
queries and so on for what you need to
 

1031
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,470
queries and so on for what you need to
work with flex because all the obviously

1032
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:44,480
work with flex because all the obviously
 

1033
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,150
work with flex because all the obviously
everything is on chain so you can you

1034
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:46,160
everything is on chain so you can you
 

1035
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,829
everything is on chain so you can you
can quite easily

1036
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:47,839
can quite easily
 

1037
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,150
can quite easily
kind of study that and do that

1038
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:50,160
kind of study that and do that
 

1039
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,309
kind of study that and do that
but because guys already did that they

1040
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:52,319
but because guys already did that they
 

1041
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,550
but because guys already did that they
want some money monetization of the of

1042
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:54,560
want some money monetization of the of
 

1043
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,230
want some money monetization of the of
this thing and flex by the way is going

1044
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:56,240
this thing and flex by the way is going
 

1045
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,390
this thing and flex by the way is going
to pay clout as well

1046
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:58,400
to pay clout as well
 

1047
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,510
to pay clout as well
you know for sure for sure and yeah and

1048
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:01,520
you know for sure for sure and yeah and
 

1049
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,750
you know for sure for sure and yeah and
the last one i promise the last one for

1050
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:03,760
the last one i promise the last one for
 

1051
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,750
the last one i promise the last one for
me is uh uh so imagine i have uh like no

1052
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:07,760
me is uh uh so imagine i have uh like no
 

1053
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,710
me is uh uh so imagine i have uh like no
not imagine i have uh light nodes like

1054
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:10,720
not imagine i have uh light nodes like
 

1055
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,589
not imagine i have uh light nodes like
light light client process light line

1056
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:13,599
light light client process light line
 

1057
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,510
light light client process light line
which is like separate implementation

1058
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:15,520
which is like separate implementation
 

1059
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,670
which is like separate implementation
and how do you think uh does it uh

1060
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:19,680
and how do you think uh does it uh
 

1061
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,109
and how do you think uh does it uh
is it is it hard to to uh

1062
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:23,119
is it is it hard to to uh
 

1063
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,470
is it is it hard to to uh
introduce some support of like indexing

1064
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:26,480
introduce some support of like indexing
 

1065
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,270
introduce some support of like indexing
here

1066
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:27,280
here
 

1067
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,550
here
so well i i'm i'm not very i'm not very

1068
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:30,560
so well i i'm i'm not very i'm not very
 

1069

so well i i'm i'm not very i'm not very
i understand i just need to say

1070
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:33,040
i understand i just need to say
 

1071
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,030
i understand i just need to say
i know address it for example

1072
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
i know address it for example
 

1073
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,030
i know address it for example
yeah well i i'm

1074
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:37,040
yeah well i i'm
 

1075
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,390
yeah well i i'm
i think uh it will be quite hard but uh

1076
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:40,400
i think uh it will be quite hard but uh
 

1077
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,990
i think uh it will be quite hard but uh
i'm not very very familiar with the

1078
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:44,000
i'm not very very familiar with the
 

1079
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,670
i'm not very very familiar with the
you know

1080
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:45,680
you know
 

1081
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,910
you know
what what uh

what what uh
limits kind of roxas introduced

1084
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:50,720
limits kind of roxas introduced
 

1085
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,990
limits kind of roxas introduced
to this um

1086
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:54,000

 

1087
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,790

to the to the implementation of the

1088
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:56,800
to the to the implementation of the
 

1089
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,790
to the to the implementation of the
of the last node so i don't know what

1090
00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:58,800
of the last node so i don't know what
 

1091
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,870
of the last node so i don't know what
what information they do have there and

1092
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:00,880
what information they do have there and
 

1093
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,390
what information they do have there and
so on

1094
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:02,400
so on
 

1095
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,109
so on

just for us maybe no

1104
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:15,040
just for us maybe no
 

1105
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,870
just for us maybe no
that's actually a good question so that

1106
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:16,880
that's actually a good question so that
 

1107
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,270
that's actually a good question so that
we could also understand

1108
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:19,280
we could also understand
 

1109
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,150
we could also understand
ways people are using uh

1110
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:22,160
ways people are using uh
 

1111
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,549
ways people are using uh
indexer sdk so

1112
00:47:24,549 --> 00:47:24,559
indexer sdk so
 

1113
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:25,750
indexer sdk so
uh

1114
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:25,760
uh
 

1115
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,069
uh
well well yeah you need to update you

1116
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:28,079
well well yeah you need to update you
 

1117
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,390
well well yeah you need to update you
need to update it by the way to you yeah

1118
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:30,400
need to update it by the way to you yeah
 

1119
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,030
need to update it by the way to you yeah
we're already already in progress

1120
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:35,040

 

1121
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,470

because like people are complaining

1122
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:38,480
because like people are complaining
 

1123
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,470
because like people are complaining
yeah

1124
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:40,480
yeah
 

1125
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,510
yeah
okay

1126

no please
i don't know if this is the right place

1130
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:45,200
i don't know if this is the right place
 

1131
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,230
i don't know if this is the right place
to ask but can you explain how does how

1132
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:48,240
to ask but can you explain how does how
 

1133
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,710
to ask but can you explain how does how
will the market

1134
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:50,720
will the market
 

1135
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,109
will the market
orders will work because that sounds

1136
00:47:53,109 --> 00:47:53,119
orders will work because that sounds
 

1137
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,829
orders will work because that sounds
complex

1138
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:55,839

 

1139
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,109

the market yes

1140
00:47:57,109 --> 00:47:57,119
the market yes
 

1141
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,030
the market yes
well the market order is the is the

1142
00:47:59,030 --> 00:47:59,040
well the market order is the is the
 

1143
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,510
well the market order is the is the
current best price order

1144
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:01,520
current best price order
 

1145
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,069
current best price order
opened right you want it's it's just a

1146
00:48:04,069 --> 00:48:04,079
opened right you want it's it's just a
 

1147
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,670
opened right you want it's it's just a
swap basically so the easy swap will be

1148
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:07,680
swap basically so the easy swap will be
 

1149
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,430
swap basically so the easy swap will be
with the that we will determine the

1150
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:11,440
with the that we will determine the
 

1151
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,990
with the that we will determine the
best price of open order so the best

1152
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:14,000
best price of open order so the best
 

1153
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,750
best price of open order so the best
open order price right now is you know

1154
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:15,760
open order price right now is you know
 

1155
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,910
open order price right now is you know
5.6

1156
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:17,920
5.6
 

1157
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,430
5.6
then it will be just executing this

1158
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:19,440
then it will be just executing this
 

1159
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,150
then it will be just executing this
market and if it's not fulfilled

1160
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:22,160
market and if it's not fulfilled
 

1161
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,270
market and if it's not fulfilled
if you have like if you want to buy 400

1162
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:25,280
if you have like if you want to buy 400
 

1163
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,150
if you have like if you want to buy 400
it will be just do 5.6 and then find 5.7

1164
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:28,160
it will be just do 5.6 and then find 5.7
 

1165
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,670
it will be just do 5.6 and then find 5.7
so in a way it's like reverse limit

1166
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:29,680
so in a way it's like reverse limit
 

1167
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,950
so in a way it's like reverse limit
order

1168
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:30,960
order
 

1169
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,390
order
um

1170
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:32,400
um
 

1171
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,710
um
that's it

1172
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:34,720
that's it
 

1173
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,190
that's it
it's not a very complex option

1174
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:37,200
it's not a very complex option
 

1175
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:42,549
it's not a very complex option
my market order is quite not complex

1176
00:48:42,549 --> 00:48:42,559

 

1177
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,670

so somehow concurrently so if somebody

1178
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:45,680
so somehow concurrently so if somebody
 

1179
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,270
so somehow concurrently so if somebody
uh wants to eat

1180
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:47,280
uh wants to eat
 

1181
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,870
uh wants to eat
the the

1182
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:48,880
the the

come to the order book even if you
 

1335
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,030
come to the order book even if you
control validators it will be hard to do

1336
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:41,040
control validators it will be hard to do
 

1337
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,109
control validators it will be hard to do
yeah but you can you can see

1338
00:51:45,109 --> 00:51:45,119

 

1339
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,870

no you cannot see other orders i mean

1340
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:46,880
no you cannot see other orders i mean
 

1341
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,349
no you cannot see other orders i mean
but you can but when you will see other

but you can but when you will see other
 

1343
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:52,069
but you can but when you will see other
orders it will be already too late

1344
00:51:52,069 --> 00:51:52,079
orders it will be already too late

00:55:13,589 --> 00:55:13,599
uh
 

1525
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,230
uh
for now it is controlled by uh by your

1526
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:16,240
for now it is controlled by uh by your
 

1527
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,390
for now it is controlled by uh by your
team but do you have

1528
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:18,400
team but do you have
 

1529
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,309
team but do you have
some mechanisms to introduce a

1530
00:55:20,309 --> 00:55:20,319
some mechanisms to introduce a
 

1531
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,470
some mechanisms to introduce a
decentralized way of how these fees will

1532
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:22,480
decentralized way of how these fees will
 

1533
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,589
decentralized way of how these fees will
be controlled obviously so they set uh

1534
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:25,599
be controlled obviously so they set uh
 

1535
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,230
be controlled obviously so they set uh
for each payer separately

1536
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:28,240
for each payer separately
 

1537
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,870
for each payer separately
meaning their rebates and the fees so

1538
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:30,880
meaning their rebates and the fees so
 

1539
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,670
meaning their rebates and the fees so
yeah the fees are controlled by will be

1540
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:33,680
yeah the fees are controlled by will be
 

1541
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,109
yeah the fees are controlled by will be
controlled by dao

1542
00:55:35,109 --> 00:55:35,119
controlled by dao
 

1543
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,710
controlled by dao
so there will be obviously

1544
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:36,720
so there will be obviously
 

1545
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,190
so there will be obviously
felix talking will will control the dao

1546
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:39,200
felix talking will will control the dao
 

1547
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,309
felix talking will will control the dao
and the dao will decide on all this and

1548
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:42,319
and the dao will decide on all this and
 

1549
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:45,430
and the dao will decide on all this and
all this is is not just the fees

1550
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:45,440
all this is is not just the fees
 

1551
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,470
all this is is not just the fees
structure but also

1552
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:48,480
structure but also
 

1553
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,190
structure but also
the

1554
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:49,200
the
 

1555
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,150
the
the liquidity because the fees are

1556
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,160
the liquidity because the fees are
 

1557
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,470
the liquidity because the fees are
taking the native tokens and they are

1558
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:54,480
taking the native tokens and they are
 

1559
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,549
taking the native tokens and they are
all these fees which are which these

1560
00:55:56,549 --> 00:55:56,559
all these fees which are which these
 

1561
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,950
all these fees which are which these
fees which are take your pace they all

1562
00:55:58,950 --> 00:55:58,960
fees which are take your pace they all
 

1563
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,510
fees which are take your pace they all
collected into the smart contracts of

1564
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:01,520
collected into the smart contracts of
 

1565
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,510
collected into the smart contracts of
this and this reserve smart contracts

1566
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:03,520
this and this reserve smart contracts
 

1567
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,750
this and this reserve smart contracts
and this reserve smart contracts

1568
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:05,760
and this reserve smart contracts
 

1569
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,349
and this reserve smart contracts
they uh always accumulate

1570
00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:09,359
they uh always accumulate
 

1571
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,710
they uh always accumulate
the fees they will never pay them out

1572
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:12,720
the fees they will never pay them out
 

1573
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,109
the fees they will never pay them out
and the structure is fair thou structure

1574
00:56:15,109 --> 00:56:15,119
and the structure is fair thou structure
 

1575
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,069
and the structure is fair thou structure
so you the only way to get this

1576
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:18,079
so you the only way to get this
 

1577
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,349
so you the only way to get this
fees out

1578
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:19,359
fees out
 

1579
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:20,549
fees out
is to

1580
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:20,559
is to
 

1581
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,950
is to
exchange burn some some ethics tokens

1582
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:22,960
exchange burn some some ethics tokens
 

1583
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,270
exchange burn some some ethics tokens
against them

1584
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:25,280
against them
 

1585
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,750
against them
um so the the flx tokens they have

1586
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:27,760
um so the the flx tokens they have
 

1587
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,710
um so the the flx tokens they have
limited supply so

1588
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:30,720
limited supply so
 

1589
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,710
limited supply so
like um

1590
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:32,720
like um
 

1591
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,069
like um
and

1592
00:56:34,069 --> 00:56:34,079
and
 

1593
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,710
and
in this in this reserves because they

1594
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:36,720
in this in this reserves because they
 

1595
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,710
in this in this reserves because they
will always grow

1596
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:38,720
will always grow
 

1597
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,589
will always grow
like

1598
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:39,599
like
 

1599
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,630
like
except for when someone is is is

1600
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:42,640
except for when someone is is is
 

1601
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,390
except for when someone is is is
you know burning their felix tokens

1602
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:44,400
you know burning their felix tokens
 

1603
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,390
you know burning their felix tokens
against them but it's it's it will be

1604
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:46,400
against them but it's it's it will be
 

1605
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,630
against them but it's it's it will be
real rare really rare because

1606
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:48,640
real rare really rare because
 

1607
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,430
real rare really rare because
it's better to send to just celebrate

1608
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:51,440
it's better to send to just celebrate
 

1609
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,109
it's better to send to just celebrate
than just to burn

1610
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:53,119
than just to burn
 

1611
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,470
than just to burn
and um and this

1612
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:56,480
and um and this
 

1613
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,230
and um and this
will give the possibility to use these

1614
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:58,240
will give the possibility to use these
 

1615
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,390
will give the possibility to use these
reserves as for example additional

1616
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:00,400
reserves as for example additional
 

1617
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,270
reserves as for example additional
liquidity or loans or or you know

1618
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:03,280
liquidity or loans or or you know

00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,109
liquidity or loans or or you know
supporting the marginal trading and so

1620
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:05,119
supporting the marginal trading and so

00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:06,559
on and so forth and all that decisions
 

1623
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,270
on and so forth and all that decisions
will be taken right now as well

1624
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:09,280
will be taken right now as well
 

1625
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,430
will be taken right now as well
okay so and um when do you think

1626
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:13,440
okay so and um when do you think
 

1627
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,109
okay so and um when do you think
you will

1628
00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:15,119
you will
 

1629
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,510
you will
be able to launch the dow so

1630
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:17,520
be able to launch the dow so
 

1631
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:23,670
be able to launch the dow so
what what is the plan

1632
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:23,680

 

1633
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,510

um

1634
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:25,520
um
 

1635
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,390
um
it we are going to launch the dow quite

1636
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:28,400
it we are going to launch the dow quite
 

1637
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,030
it we are going to launch the dow quite
soon because the the flex token is

1638
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:31,040
soon because the the flex token is
 

1639
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,069
soon because the the flex token is
already

1640
00:57:32,069 --> 00:57:32,079
already
 

1641
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:33,990
already
like on sale

1642
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:34,000
like on sale
 

1643
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,030
like on sale
to some

1644
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:35,040
to some
 

1645
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,549
to some
investors

1646
00:57:36,549 --> 00:57:36,559
investors
 

1647
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:38,950
investors
and uh but they're not physically yet

1648
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:38,960
and uh but they're not physically yet
 

1649
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,950
and uh but they're not physically yet
available

1650
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:40,960
available
 

1651
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,510
available
but there will be ideal on flex itself

1652
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:45,520
but there will be ideal on flex itself
 

1653
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,309
but there will be ideal on flex itself
so

1654
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:46,319
so
 

1655
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,789
so
maybe the dao won't have like the full

1656
00:57:48,789 --> 00:57:48,799
maybe the dao won't have like the full
 

1657
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,069
maybe the dao won't have like the full
functionality

1658
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:50,079
functionality
 

1659
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,109
functionality
but

1660
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:51,119
but
 

1661
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,109
but
the flex token will come first and then

1662
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:53,119
the flex token will come first and then
 

1663
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,670
the flex token will come first and then
the functionality which connects to this

1664
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:55,680
the functionality which connects to this
 

1665
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,589
the functionality which connects to this
tokens will come a little later just

1666
00:57:57,589 --> 00:57:57,599
tokens will come a little later just
 

1667
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,910
tokens will come a little later just
because simply to write that take time

1668
00:57:59,910 --> 00:57:59,920
because simply to write that take time
 

1669
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,270
because simply to write that take time
but yeah
