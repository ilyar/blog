182
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
is
 

183
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,909
is
uh actually the the peculiarity of the

184
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
uh actually the the peculiarity of the
 

185
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,230
uh actually the the peculiarity of the
protocol we are using is that it can has

186
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
protocol we are using is that it can has
 

187
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,070
protocol we are using is that it can has
uh many native uh coins that can be used

188
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
uh many native uh coins that can be used
 

189
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,430
uh many native uh coins that can be used
also for gas payment and surf is the

190
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
also for gas payment and surf is the
 

191
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,830
also for gas payment and surf is the
system currency so and currently we have

192
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
system currency so and currently we have
 

193
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,150
system currency so and currently we have
only one system currency which you know

194
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
only one system currency which you know
 

195
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,830
only one system currency which you know
as ever

196
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
as ever
 

197
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,790
as ever
and uh potentially as srj said you can

198
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
and uh potentially as srj said you can
 

199
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,830
and uh potentially as srj said you can
add a few a few more and never is

200
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
add a few a few more and never is
 

201
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,629
add a few a few more and never is
expected to be one of those

202
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
expected to be one of those
 

203
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,070
expected to be one of those
okay

204
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
okay
 

205
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,430
okay
and uh

206
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
and uh
 

207
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,790
and uh
in case if something goes wrong and if

208
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
in case if something goes wrong and if
 

209
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,029
in case if something goes wrong and if
bible benches will not be able to

210
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
bible benches will not be able to
 

211
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,830
bible benches will not be able to
introduce as a native coin in this case

212
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,840
introduce as a native coin in this case
 

213
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,029
introduce as a native coin in this case
uh the

214
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
uh the
 

215
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,310
uh the
backup plan

216
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
backup plan
 

217
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,950
backup plan
is to design it as a tip three uh

218
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960

 

219
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,629

tip three coin

220
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
tip three coin
 

221
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,110
tip three coin
but it is definitely

222
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
but it is definitely
 

223
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,110
but it is definitely
a less preferred

224
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
a less preferred
 

225
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,390
a less preferred
approach

226
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
approach
 

227
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,430
approach
i would also say uh i would also uh

228
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
i would also say uh i would also uh
 

229
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,029
i would also say uh i would also uh
know that it's not

230
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
know that it's not
 

231
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,150
know that it's not
tip three but rather tip three point one

232
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
tip three but rather tip three point one
 

233
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,790
tip three but rather tip three point one
because we had the uh standards update

234
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
because we had the uh standards update
 

235
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,870
because we had the uh standards update
recently yeah i know

236
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
recently yeah i know
 

237
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,350
recently yeah i know
yeah okay it's worse to reflect this

238
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
yeah okay it's worse to reflect this
 

239
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,189
yeah okay it's worse to reflect this
sure maybe now it's type 3 yes but in

240
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
sure maybe now it's type 3 yes but in
 

241
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,950
sure maybe now it's type 3 yes but in
the future must be type 3.1

242
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
the future must be type 3.1
 

243
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,309
the future must be type 3.1
yes or no

244
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
yes or no
 

245
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,150
yes or no
yeah

246
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
yeah
 

247
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,790
yeah
should be

248
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800

 

249
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,629

okay so let's let's move on to the next

250
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
okay so let's let's move on to the next
 

251
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,909
okay so let's let's move on to the next
slide

252
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
slide
 

253
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,070
slide
and let's say a few words about the key

254
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
and let's say a few words about the key
 

255
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,110
and let's say a few words about the key
players or the key actor actors of this

256
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
players or the key actor actors of this
 

257
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,150
players or the key actor actors of this
process they're called validators

258
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
process they're called validators
 

259
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,670
process they're called validators
uh the

260
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
uh the
 

261
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,909
uh the
the goal of validators is to set up the

262
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919
the goal of validators is to set up the
 

263
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,710
the goal of validators is to set up the
basic range between never and ever

264
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720

 

265
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,230

so so

266
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
so so
 

267
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,710
so so
these are supposed to work in the

268
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
these are supposed to work in the
 

269
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,070
these are supposed to work in the
foreign way

270
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
foreign way
 

271
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,230
foreign way
they uh suggest

272
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240

 

273
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,510

some rapes

274
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,520
some rapes
 

275
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,629
some rapes
such as them in a disclosed

276
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639
such as them in a disclosed
 

277
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,309
such as them in a disclosed
equilibrium so nobody can can can

278
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
equilibrium so nobody can can can
 

279
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,790
equilibrium so nobody can can can
see them before rewind

280
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
see them before rewind
 

281
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,830
see them before rewind
and upon the time of revealing

282
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
and upon the time of revealing
 

283
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,950
and upon the time of revealing
all their

284
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
all their
 

285
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,870
all their
suggestions are

286
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
suggestions are
 

287
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,830
suggestions are
revealed

288
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840
revealed
 

289
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,629
revealed
and

290
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
and
 

291
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,070
and
uh so the

292
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
uh so the
 

293
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,790
uh so the
media rate is considered as a basic rate

294
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
media rate is considered as a basic rate
 

295
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,029
media rate is considered as a basic rate
for uh for for the never ever

296
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
for uh for for the never ever
 

297
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,029
for uh for for the never ever
uh

298
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
uh
 

299
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,390
uh
rate um i change rate

300
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
rate um i change rate
 

301
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,390
rate um i change rate
so so

302
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
so so
 

303
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,469
so so
those radiators who failed to provide

304
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
those radiators who failed to provide
 

305
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,830
those radiators who failed to provide
the race close to the median one

306
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
the race close to the median one
 

307
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,710
the race close to the median one
uh uh

308
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:27,720
uh uh
 

309
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,110

so if you need any details any any deep

442
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
so if you need any details any any deep
 

443
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,550
so if you need any details any any deep
technical details you can look in

444
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
technical details you can look in
 

445
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,389
technical details you can look in
into that article

446
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399

 

447
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:15,590

okay any questions so far

448
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600

 

449
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,430

i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm saying something

450
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm saying something
 

451
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,790
i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm saying something
and i'm muted

452
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
and i'm muted
 

453
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,150
and i'm muted
so actually

454
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
so actually
 

455
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,750
so actually
my first question here uh is

456
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
my first question here uh is
 

457
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,230
my first question here uh is
which

458
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240

 

459
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,949

exchanges

460
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959

 

461
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,509

so

462
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519

 

463
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,550

oracle

464
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
oracle
 

465
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,269
oracle
can uh or validator of the system yeah

466
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:35,279
can uh or validator of the system yeah
 

467
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,790
can uh or validator of the system yeah
so can provide any data in fact uh about

468
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
so can provide any data in fact uh about
 

469
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,069
so can provide any data in fact uh about
the exchange rate of uh ever to us

470
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
the exchange rate of uh ever to us
 

471
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,190
the exchange rate of uh ever to us
dollar

472
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
dollar
 

473
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,590
dollar
uh so uh what happens uh if for example

474
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
uh so uh what happens uh if for example
 

475
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,110
uh so uh what happens uh if for example
someone takes uh as input data

476
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
someone takes uh as input data
 

477
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,470
someone takes uh as input data
uh some exchange that this uh provides

478
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
uh some exchange that this uh provides
 

479
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,710
uh some exchange that this uh provides
so this doesn't have enough liquidity

480
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
so this doesn't have enough liquidity
 

481
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,509
so this doesn't have enough liquidity
for example for forever and that's why

482
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
for example for forever and that's why
 

483
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,949
for example for forever and that's why
it's exchange rate fluctuates a lot and

484
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
it's exchange rate fluctuates a lot and
 

485
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,750
it's exchange rate fluctuates a lot and
also uh

486
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760

 

487
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,350

on

488
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
on
 

489
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,470
on
on average so it provides the wrong date

490
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
on average so it provides the wrong date
 

491
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,269
on average so it provides the wrong date
so will this validate to be slashed uh

492
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
so will this validate to be slashed uh
 

493
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,069
so will this validate to be slashed uh
or what happens with him so how how's

494
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
or what happens with him so how how's
 

495
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,470
or what happens with him so how how's
the slashing mechanism works actually

496
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
the slashing mechanism works actually
 

497
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,150
the slashing mechanism works actually
actually uh yes

498
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
actually uh yes
 

499
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,030
actually uh yes
this is

500
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040
this is
 

501
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:28,230
this is
this is

502
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240

 

503
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,910

for the current round

504
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
for the current round
 

505
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,069
for the current round
and in case of

506
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
and in case of
 

507
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,910
and in case of
repetitions it

508
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
repetitions it
 

509
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,150
repetitions it
can be slashed

510
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
can be slashed
 

511
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,870
can be slashed
yeah but it's slashing uh is hard

512
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
yeah but it's slashing uh is hard
 

513
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,630
yeah but it's slashing uh is hard
meaning that it

514
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:40,640
meaning that it
 

515
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,030
meaning that it
slashes all the stake of the validator

516
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
slashes all the stake of the validator
 

517
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,069
slashes all the stake of the validator
or

518
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,079
or
 

519
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,470
or
it rather slashes a

520
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
it rather slashes a
 

521
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,310
it rather slashes a
part of it

522
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
part of it
 

523
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,430
part of it
actually

524
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440

mechanism is uh
 

739
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,230
mechanism is uh
adjacent so it's basically something

00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
adjacent so it's basically something
 

741
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,749
adjacent so it's basically something
like depool

00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:41,759
like depool
 

743
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,870

uh the auction if participants do not

know the price
but

762
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240
but
 

763
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,430
but
they have some strategy for example

764
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
they have some strategy for example
 

765
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,190
they have some strategy for example
then they can use the information from

766
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
then they can use the information from
 

767
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,950
then they can use the information from
the particular exchanges

768
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
the particular exchanges
 

769
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,190
the particular exchanges
then can

770
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,200
then can
 

771
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,190
then can
say use

772
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200
say use
 

773
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,990
say use
more aggressive high higher prices or

774
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
more aggressive high higher prices or
 

775
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:12,789
more aggressive high higher prices or
more conservative lower prices

776
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:12,799

 

777
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,909

but i didn't get the question

778
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919

 

779
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,470

that the auction is the joint

780
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
that the auction is the joint

business mechanism yeah
 

783
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,789

okay so then

784
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
okay so then
 

785
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,430
okay so then
it means that uh somebody should select

786
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
it means that uh somebody should select
 

787
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,789
it means that uh somebody should select
the price which is offered by that beat

788
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:28,799
the price which is offered by that beat
 

789
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,710
the price which is offered by that beat

00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:30,400
but
 

899
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,950
but
i don't know how how exactly should it

900
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:32,960
i don't know how how exactly should it
 

901
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,990
i don't know how how exactly should it
work

902
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,000

 

903
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,110

so so owner is not the person owner is

904
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,120
so so owner is not the person owner is
 

905
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,230
so so owner is not the person owner is
uh is a contract

906
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,240

 

907
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,870

i personally based on my experience

908
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
i personally based on my experience
 

909
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,190
i personally based on my experience
would recommend you uh in any case you

910
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,200
would recommend you uh in any case you
 

911
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,510
would recommend you uh in any case you
will have the project page so somehow

912
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:49,520
will have the project page so somehow
 

913
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,549
will have the project page so somehow
yeah so and for people be able to deploy

914
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:52,559
yeah so and for people be able to deploy
 

915
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,630
yeah so and for people be able to deploy
the validators whatever

916
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:54,640
the validators whatever
 

917
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,750
the validators whatever
uh also

918
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760

 

919
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,590

have uh the tool on your web page for

920
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
have uh the tool on your web page for
 

921
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,230
have uh the tool on your web page for
each validator to provide description at

922
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,240
each validator to provide description at
 

923
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,190
each validator to provide description at
least about them and

924
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200
least about them and
 

925
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,950
least about them and
how they are calculating the price

926
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:08,960
how they are calculating the price
 

927
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,470
how they are calculating the price
because otherwise it's a black box so it

928
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,480
because otherwise it's a black box so it
 

929
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,149
because otherwise it's a black box so it
doesn't work like this

930
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,159
doesn't work like this
 

931
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,110
doesn't work like this
okay maybe we should work on uh

932
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,120
okay maybe we should work on uh
 

933
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,950
okay maybe we should work on uh
how to how to how to um

934
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:20,960
how to how to how to um
 

935
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,710
how to how to how to um
work uh

936
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:22,720
work uh
 

937
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,669
work uh
huh

938
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:23,679
huh
 

939
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,630
huh
how uh owners of the oceans can uh

940
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:26,640
how uh owners of the oceans can uh
 

941
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,190
how uh owners of the oceans can uh
determine their strategies maybe i don't

942
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:29,200
determine their strategies maybe i don't
 

943
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,990
determine their strategies maybe i don't
know it's the point to think

944
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
know it's the point to think
 

945
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,470
know it's the point to think
uh how how often auctions

946
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,480
uh how how often auctions
 

947
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,750
uh how how often auctions
go

948
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
go
 

949
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,950
go
is it like each block or every 10 blocks

950
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:38,960
is it like each block or every 10 blocks
 

951
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,669
is it like each block or every 10 blocks
or

952
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:39,679
or
 

953
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,710
or
how it works

954
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:42,720

 

955
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,830

uh i guess it's about uh every

956
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:45,840
uh i guess it's about uh every
 

957
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,149
uh i guess it's about uh every
every every few minutes or maybe every

958
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:48,159
every every few minutes or maybe every
 

959
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,950
every every few minutes or maybe every
hour because uh uh

960
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:50,960
hour because uh uh
 

961
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,630
hour because uh uh
price uh

962
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:52,640
price uh
 

963
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,630
price uh
pri pri oracle's uh price calculation is

964
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:56,640
pri pri oracle's uh price calculation is
 

965
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,830
pri pri oracle's uh price calculation is
not not so fast it takes

966
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
not not so fast it takes
 

967
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,510
not not so fast it takes
about 20 or 30 seconds

968
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
about 20 or 30 seconds
 

969
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,390
about 20 or 30 seconds
but then there will be huge slippage

970
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:06,400
but then there will be huge slippage
 

971
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,590
but then there will be huge slippage
because yes

972
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
because yes
 

973
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,390
because yes
you you yeah you provided some

974
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,400
you you yeah you provided some
 

975
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,029
you you yeah you provided some
of course when you go into the auction

976
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:15,039
of course when you go into the auction
 

977
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,630
of course when you go into the auction
uh you

978
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:16,640
uh you
 

979
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,870
uh you
you can look at the current price on the

980
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:18,880
you can look at the current price on the
 

981
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,270
you can look at the current price on the
market and those those oracles they

982
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
market and those those oracles they
 

983
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,590
market and those those oracles they
provide just indicative range for an

984
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:23,600
provide just indicative range for an
 

985
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,270
provide just indicative range for an
auction but still okay uh

986
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:27,280
auction but still okay uh
 

987
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,909
auction but still okay uh
it's it's a question to andre andre and

okay guys okay but you should uh

1014
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840
okay guys okay but you should uh
 

1015
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,190
okay guys okay but you should uh
yeah you should understand what you're

1016
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,200
yeah you should understand what you're
 

1017
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,470
yeah you should understand what you're
doing

1018

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,510

i mean

1020
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
i mean
 

1021
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,510
i mean
yeah my question is that

1022
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:13,520
yeah my question is that
 

1023
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,510
yeah my question is that
how quickly

1024
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:15,520
how quickly
 

1025
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,590
how quickly
auction will be executed

1026
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:17,600
auction will be executed
 

1027
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,310
auction will be executed
so you you made a bid and then in how

1028
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:20,320
so you you made a bid and then in how
 

1029
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,270
so you you made a bid and then in how
many

1030
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,280
many
 

1031
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,470
many
seconds blocks you'll get the

1032
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:24,480
seconds blocks you'll get the
 

1033
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,430
seconds blocks you'll get the
conversion

1034
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,440

 

1035
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,750

uh i guess though only uh the only

1036
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:31,760
uh i guess though only uh the only
 

1037
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,710
uh i guess though only uh the only
one only problem only issue that should

kind of kind of uh fake participants uh
 

1139
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,110
kind of kind of uh fake participants uh
who

1140
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,120
who
 

1141
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,390
who
uh

1142
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:50,400
uh
 

1143
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,710
uh
who are a combination of a smaller

1144
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:52,720
who are a combination of a smaller
 

1145
00:25:52,720 --> 00:26:03,110
who are a combination of a smaller
participant yeah it's liquidity pool

1146
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120

 

1147
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,750

the question is that

1148
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:05,760
the question is that
 

1149
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,190
the question is that
actual from

1150
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:07,200
actual from
 

1151
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,430
actual from
usability point of view

1152
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:09,440
usability point of view
 

1153
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,830
usability point of view
and if auctions uh

1154
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:11,840
and if auctions uh
 

1155
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,710
and if auctions uh
quite

1156
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:12,720
quite
 

1157
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,510
quite
happen quite often then it is no way for

1158
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:15,520
happen quite often then it is no way for
 

1159
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,149
happen quite often then it is no way for
regular users to be able to

1160
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:18,159
regular users to be able to
 

1161
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:18,950
regular users to be able to
uh

1162
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:18,960
uh
 

1163
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,789
uh
participate because then they should

1164
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:20,799
participate because then they should
 

1165
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,710
participate because then they should
like

1166
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:22,720
like
 

1167
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,830
like
sit and wait before they send some uh

1168
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:25,840
sit and wait before they send some uh
 

1169
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,950
sit and wait before they send some uh
tokens to

1170
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:26,960
tokens to
 

1171
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,470
tokens to
the auctions and the other question is

1172
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:28,480
the auctions and the other question is
 

1173
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,149
the auctions and the other question is
that for example if you participated in

1174
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:30,159
that for example if you participated in
 

1175
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,549
that for example if you participated in
the election contract which didn't win

1176
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:32,559
the election contract which didn't win
 

1177
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,510
the election contract which didn't win
so then uh what happens then you don't

1178
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:37,520
so then uh what happens then you don't
 

1179
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,549
so then uh what happens then you don't
you don't

1180
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:38,559
you don't
 

1181
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,909
you don't
get exchange

1182
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:41,919

 

1183
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,669

as i know as i know uh in it's

1184
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:45,679
as i know as i know uh in it's
 

1185

my
 

1189
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,950
my
personal opinion is that the oceans

1190
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:52,960
personal opinion is that the oceans
 

1191
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,310
personal opinion is that the oceans
should be

1192
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,320
should be
 

1193
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,750

1254
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:19,440
uh
 

1255
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,590
uh
very very there is uh there is a few

1256
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:21,600
very very there is uh there is a few
 

1257
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,310
very very there is uh there is a few
possible strategies so it can be

1258
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:24,320
possible strategies so it can be
 

1259
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,430
possible strategies so it can be
uh

1260
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:25,440
uh
 

1261
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,590
uh
it can be a auctions fee it can be a

1262
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:27,600
it can be a auctions fee it can be a
 

1263
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,870
it can be a auctions fee it can be a
transfer fee uh it

1264
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:30,880
transfer fee uh it
 

1265
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,070
transfer fee uh it
can be

1266
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,080
can be
 

1267
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,149
can be
a part of emission

1268
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:34,159
a part of emission
 

1269
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,269
a part of emission
and

1270
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:35,279
and
 

1271
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,350
and
this decision decision is not made for

1272
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:37,360
this decision decision is not made for
 

1273
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,350
this decision decision is not made for
now

1274
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:39,360
now
 

1275
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,389
now
but can you at least please uh propose

1276
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:42,399
but can you at least please uh propose
 

1277
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,549
but can you at least please uh propose
those scenarios because i asked this

1278
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:44,559
those scenarios because i asked this
 

1279
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,149
those scenarios because i asked this
question last time so it's the first

1280
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:46,159
question last time so it's the first
 

1281
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,269
question last time so it's the first
stage so

1282
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:47,279
stage so
 

1283
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,029
stage so
and uh

1284
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:49,039
and uh
 

1285
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,269
and uh
it was too early maybe but now when

1286
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:51,279
it was too early maybe but now when
 

1287
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,110
it was too early maybe but now when
you're approaching the

1288
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,120
you're approaching the
 

1289
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,430
you're approaching the
uh implementation station the auctions

1290
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:55,440
uh implementation station the auctions
 

1291
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,190
uh implementation station the auctions
should if they ser

1292
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,200
should if they ser
 

1293
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,269
should if they ser
function as depooled so they also should

1294
00:28:59,269 --> 00:28:59,279
function as depooled so they also should
 

1295
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,029
function as depooled so they also should
include the functionality

1296
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:01,039
include the functionality
 

1297
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,230
include the functionality
for

1298
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:02,240
for
 

1299
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,070
for
distributing rewards

1300
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,080
distributing rewards
 

1301
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,750
distributing rewards
and in this case so

1302
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:05,760
and in this case so
 

1303
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,350
and in this case so
it really

1304
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,360
it really
 

1305
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,590
it really
may be affected by how the economic

1306
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:09,600
may be affected by how the economic
 

1307
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,110
may be affected by how the economic
model is implemented

1308
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,120

 

1309
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,190

so i would recommend

1310
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,200
so i would recommend
 

1311
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,070
so i would recommend
at least defining a few ways on how the

1312
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,080
at least defining a few ways on how the
 

1313
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,389
at least defining a few ways on how the
economics can function

1314
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:20,399
economics can function
 

1315
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,149
economics can function
and the second

1316
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:22,159
and the second
 

1317
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,350
and the second
question is when there is a slashing

1318
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:25,360
question is when there is a slashing
 

1319
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,110
question is when there is a slashing
appears on some validator so where does

1320
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,120
appears on some validator so where does
 

1321
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,190
appears on some validator so where does
his stake goes

1322
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:31,200
his stake goes
 

1323
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,909
his stake goes
so

1324
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:31,919
so
 

1325
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,590
so
there is a distribution between all

1326
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:33,600
there is a distribution between all
 

1327
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,190
there is a distribution between all
other players and on what basis

1328
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,200
other players and on what basis
 

1329
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,269
other players and on what basis
or it's just

1330
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:39,279
or it's just
 

1331
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,669
or it's just
returned and his address is banned

1332
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:41,679
returned and his address is banned
 

1333
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,909
returned and his address is banned
or some some other scenario

1334
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:45,919

 

1335
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,269

um

1336
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:47,279
um
 

1337
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,470
um
it's not specified for now it can be in

1338
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:50,480
it's not specified for now it can be in
 

1339
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,269
it's not specified for now it can be in
in in any scenario and

1340
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:53,279
in in any scenario and
 

1341
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,269
in in any scenario and
as i understand it's

1342
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:55,279
as i understand it's
 

1343
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,830
as i understand it's
this solution is uh integration of

1344
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,840
this solution is uh integration of
 

1345
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,710
this solution is uh integration of
solution between different parts so it

1346
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:00,720
solution between different parts so it
 

1347
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,669
solution between different parts so it
should be on the final uh third

1348
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:03,679
should be on the final uh third
 

1349
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,669
should be on the final uh third

1377
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,230
which i didn't know which i didn't hear
the main question is uh uh what is the

1378
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,240
the main question is uh uh what is the
 

1379
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,110
the main question is uh uh what is the
motivation for uh validators uh to

1380
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,120
motivation for uh validators uh to
 

1381
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,909
motivation for uh validators uh to
participate in the system so where money

1382
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:47,919
participate in the system so where money
 

1383
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,350
participate in the system so where money
come from

1384
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,360
come from
 

1385
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,789
come from
and how is he distributed

1386
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:52,799
and how is he distributed
 

1387
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,470
and how is he distributed
well it distributes according to the

1388
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:54,480
well it distributes according to the
 

1389
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,750
well it distributes according to the
stakes

1390
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:55,760
stakes
 

1391
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,149

00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:58,159
and in the white paper
 

1393
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,149

which i don't remember now but there are
 

1397
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,830
which i don't remember now but there are
some commissions that uh taken from

00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:03,840
some commissions that uh taken from
 

1399

1427
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:40,470
to um
uh

1428
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:40,480
uh
 

1429
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,870
uh
yeah so actually sell a lot or buy a lot

1430
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:42,880
yeah so actually sell a lot or buy a lot
 

1431
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:59,190
yeah so actually sell a lot or buy a lot
of uh neighbors uh

1432
00:31:59,190 --> 00:31:59,200

 

1433
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,470

like 99 sure i mean i may remember that

1434
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:02,480
like 99 sure i mean i may remember that
 

1435
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,870
like 99 sure i mean i may remember that
that that's part of the white paper

1436
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:04,880
that that's part of the white paper
 

1437
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,669
that that's part of the white paper
okay

1438
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:05,679
okay
 

1439
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,990
okay
and uh are there any uh plans to uh use

1440
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,000
and uh are there any uh plans to uh use
 

1441
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,549
and uh are there any uh plans to uh use
the collateral that

1442
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:12,559
the collateral that
 

1443
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,110
the collateral that
is back in the never uh

1444
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,120
is back in the never uh
 

1445
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,470
is back in the never uh
exchange rate

1446
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:16,480
exchange rate
 

1447
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,269
exchange rate
uh

1448
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:17,279
uh
 

1449
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,269
uh
in some i don't know in landing

1450
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:19,279
in some i don't know in landing
 

1451
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,990
in some i don't know in landing
protocols or whatever so just to make

1452
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,000
protocols or whatever so just to make
 

1453
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,870
protocols or whatever so just to make
money no this is a stabilization uh

1454
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:24,880
money no this is a stabilization uh
 

1455
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,789
money no this is a stabilization uh
collateral so

1456
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:26,799
collateral so
 

1457
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,750
collateral so
it should be used to stabilize the the

1458
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:29,760
it should be used to stabilize the the
 

1459
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,710
it should be used to stabilize the the
system

1460
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:30,720
system
 

1461
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,389
system
because that exactly provides like an

00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:32,399
because that exactly provides like an
 

1463
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,070
because that exactly provides like an
insurance that provides

1464
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,080
insurance that provides
 

1465
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,470
insurance that provides
the guarantees that um

1466
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:36,480
the guarantees that um
 

1467
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,350
the guarantees that um
that you it's like a central bank uh

1468
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,360
that you it's like a central bank uh
 

1469
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,190
that you it's like a central bank uh
you know preserve

1470
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:41,200
you know preserve
 

1471
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,750
you know preserve
it ensures that there is no run on the

1477
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,590

um
 

1485
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,549
um
like

1486
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:52,559
like
 

1487
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,750
like
the the

1488
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:53,760
the the
 

1489
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,269
the the
the everest will be exchanged numbers

1490
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:55,279
the everest will be exchanged numbers
 

1491
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,509
the everest will be exchanged numbers
will be always essential with the within

1492
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:57,519
will be always essential with the within
 

1493
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,750
will be always essential with the within
the current price

1494
00:32:59,750 --> 00:32:59,760
the current price
 

1495
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,710
the current price
um that is currently projected by

1496
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:02,720
um that is currently projected by
 

1497
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,590
um that is currently projected by
by

1498
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:03,600
by
 

1499
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,870
by
the oracles

1500
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:04,880
the oracles
 

1501
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,990
the oracles
okay so the answer is no

1502
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
okay so the answer is no
 

1503
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,389
okay so the answer is no
yeah the answer is no and and right but

1504
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:10,399
yeah the answer is no and and right but
 

1505
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,190
yeah the answer is no and and right but
again um

1506
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,200
again um
 

1507
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,149
again um
because if it would be over

1508
00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:14,159
because if it would be over
 

1509
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,070
because if it would be over
collateralized then then you know what

1510
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,080
collateralized then then you know what
 

1511
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,509
collateralized then then you know what
will happen

1512
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:17,519
will happen
 

1513
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,509
will happen
yeah obviously it's like the collateral

1514
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:19,519
yeah obviously it's like the collateral
 

1515
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,269
yeah obviously it's like the collateral
which is over collateralized

1516
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:21,279
which is over collateralized
 

1517
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,789
which is over collateralized
means that

1518
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:22,799
means that
 

1519
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,230
means that
or i would say under collateralize in

1520
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,240
or i would say under collateralize in
 

1521
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,590
or i would say under collateralize in
this respect and that means no

1522
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:25,600
this respect and that means no
 

1523
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,430
this respect and that means no
collateral

1524
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:27,440
collateral
 

1525
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,950
collateral
yeah so if you use it in the lending

1526
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:28,960
yeah so if you use it in the lending
 

1527
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,870
yeah so if you use it in the lending
protocols then then then you're kind of

1528
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:30,880
protocols then then then you're kind of
 

1529
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,230
protocols then then then you're kind of
basically just reducing the

1530
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:32,240
basically just reducing the
 

1531
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,750
basically just reducing the
characterization

1532
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:33,760
characterization
 

1533
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,350
characterization
okay okay very good so um one uh maybe

1534
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:37,360
okay okay very good so um one uh maybe
 

1535
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,310
okay okay very good so um one uh maybe
last question from my side so uh whether

1536
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,320
last question from my side so uh whether
 

1537
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,909
last question from my side so uh whether
or not the system is going to have a

1538
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:41,919
or not the system is going to have a
 

1539
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,549
or not the system is going to have a
dial so uh to configure all the

1540
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:44,559
dial so uh to configure all the
 

1541
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,029
dial so uh to configure all the
parameters of this uh

1542
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:47,039
parameters of this uh
 

1543
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,669
parameters of this uh
never stabilization system

1544
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:49,679
never stabilization system
 

1545
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,590
never stabilization system
well we know when i thought that it's

1546
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:51,600
well we know when i thought that it's
 

1547
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,149
well we know when i thought that it's
need to have a dow because like these

1548
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:54,159
need to have a dow because like these
 

1549
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,509
need to have a dow because like these
validators that are are actually valid

1550
00:33:57,509 --> 00:33:57,519
validators that are are actually valid
 

1551
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,990
validators that are are actually valid
they call oracles that validating it

1552
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,000
they call oracles that validating it
 

1553
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,549
they call oracles that validating it
and then the main governance now i think

1554
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:02,559
and then the main governance now i think
 

1555
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,710
and then the main governance now i think
should should govern the system because

1556
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:04,720
should should govern the system because
 

1557
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,669
should should govern the system because
it's a system it's a system protocol

1558
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:07,679
it's a system it's a system protocol
 

1559
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,149
it's a system it's a system protocol
and that's always was kind of like the

1560
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:10,159
and that's always was kind of like the
 

1561
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,230
and that's always was kind of like the
idea was to create a system level

1562
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:12,240
idea was to create a system level
 

1563
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,430
idea was to create a system level
protocol okay and and what is what it

1564
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:15,440
protocol okay and and what is what it
 

1565
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,270
protocol okay and and what is what it
what is important to mention is and i

1566
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:17,280
what is important to mention is and i
 

1567
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,829
what is important to mention is and i
thought by the way that oracles are

1568
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:18,839
thought by the way that oracles are
 

1569
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:23,109
thought by the way that oracles are
already uh implemented now

1570
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:23,119
already uh implemented now
 

1571
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,790
already uh implemented now
yeah they were implemented

1572
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:24,800
yeah they were implemented
 

1573
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,589
yeah they were implemented
so i would suggest additional kind of

1574
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:27,599
so i would suggest additional kind of
 

1575
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,230
so i would suggest additional kind of
small contest to add

1576
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,240
small contest to add
 

1577
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,829
small contest to add
or maybe it's already there i didn't

1578
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:31,839
or maybe it's already there i didn't
 

1579
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,349
or maybe it's already there i didn't
really see the implementation sorry um

1580
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:35,359
really see the implementation sorry um
 

1581
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,389
really see the implementation sorry um
it is very important to add actually uh

1582
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:38,399
it is very important to add actually uh
 

1583
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,589
it is very important to add actually uh
to the oracle data possibility to uh

1584
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:41,599
to the oracle data possibility to uh
 

1585
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,230
to the oracle data possibility to uh
suggest arbitrary data not only the like

1586
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:44,240
suggest arbitrary data not only the like
 

1587
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,869
suggest arbitrary data not only the like
dollar for example curve

1588
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:46,879
dollar for example curve
 

1589
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,470
dollar for example curve
uh price

1590
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:48,480
uh price
 

1591
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,550
uh price
so and that is important because if we

1592
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:50,560
so and that is important because if we
 

1593
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,310
so and that is important because if we
already have a protocol

1594
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:52,320
already have a protocol
 

1595
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,190
already have a protocol
that

1596
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,200
that
 

1597
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,270
that
kind of ensures the data is correct

1598
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:55,280
kind of ensures the data is correct
 

1599
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,190
kind of ensures the data is correct
meaning that the oracle data is correct

1600
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:57,200
meaning that the oracle data is correct
 

1601
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,430
meaning that the oracle data is correct
and we should use it to

1602
00:34:59,430 --> 00:34:59,440
and we should use it to
 

1603
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,190
and we should use it to
uh to kind of provide all sorts of data

1604
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,200
uh to kind of provide all sorts of data
 

1605
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,109
uh to kind of provide all sorts of data
different other data

1606
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:05,119
different other data
 

1607
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,910
different other data
for example if someone wants to start a

1608
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:07,920
for example if someone wants to start a
 

1609
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,030
for example if someone wants to start a
synthetic asset of a projection apple

1610
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,040
synthetic asset of a projection apple
 

1611
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,910
synthetic asset of a projection apple
stock price within the system

1612
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:13,920
stock price within the system
 

1613
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,710
stock price within the system
then apart from the auction part so the

1614
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:16,720
then apart from the auction part so the
 

1615
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,750
then apart from the auction part so the
auction part is only forever and ever

1616
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:19,760
auction part is only forever and ever
 

1617
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,430
auction part is only forever and ever
but the oracles can

1618
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:21,440
but the oracles can
 

1619
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,510
but the oracles can
actually take and make more money by

1620
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:23,520
actually take and make more money by
 

1621
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,630
actually take and make more money by
that

1622
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:24,640
that
 

1623
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,390
that
by by also by also providing for the

1624
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:26,400
by by also by also providing for the
 

1625
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,069
by by also by also providing for the
same mechanism providing not the dollar

1626
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:28,079
same mechanism providing not the dollar
 

1627
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,510
same mechanism providing not the dollar
price data but

1628
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:29,520
price data but
 

1629
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,349
price data but
you know i will stock price data or you

1630
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:31,359
you know i will stock price data or you
 

1631

synthetic asset
 

1647
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,829
synthetic asset
based on this and

1648
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:49,839
based on this and
 

1649
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:50,870
based on this and
pay

1650
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:50,880
pay
 

1651
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,670
pay
back

1652
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:51,680

under certain conditions like paid back

1654
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:54,320
under certain conditions like paid back
 

1655
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,710
under certain conditions like paid back
to the validators for providing this

1656
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:56,720
to the validators for providing this
 

1657
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,030
to the validators for providing this
this this data and that will create kind

1658
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,040
this this data and that will create kind
 

1659
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,829
this this data and that will create kind
of universal oracle more or less within

1660
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:01,839
of universal oracle more or less within
 

1661
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,550
of universal oracle more or less within
the system on the system level

1662
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:04,560
the system on the system level
 

1663
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,870
the system on the system level
um which i think is a very beneficial

1664
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:06,880
um which i think is a very beneficial
 

1665
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,109
um which i think is a very beneficial
idea and

1666
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:09,119
idea and
 

1667
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,349
idea and
i think that will create a lot of boost

1668
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:11,359
i think that will create a lot of boost
 

1669
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,390
i think that will create a lot of boost
for

1670
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:12,400
for
 

1671
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,670
for
kind of

1672
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:13,680
kind of
 

1673
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,150
kind of
as well basically it will position

1674
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,160
as well basically it will position
 

1675
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,670
as well basically it will position
um the access on every scale being able

1676
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:19,680
um the access on every scale being able
 

1677
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,710
um the access on every scale being able
to

services any centralized exchange uh
even not the crypto only one but for

1686
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:28,800
even not the crypto only one but for
 

1687
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,270
even not the crypto only one but for
example we can really go and and kind of

1688
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:31,280
example we can really go and and kind of
 

1689
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,310
example we can really go and and kind of
i don't know

1690
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:32,320
i don't know
 

1691
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,630
i don't know
compete with ftx

1692
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:36,640

 

1693
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,109

okay and it's easily done because again

1694
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:39,119
okay and it's easily done because again
 

1695
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,990
okay and it's easily done because again
the the protocol is already there

1696
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,000
the the protocol is already there
 

1697
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,589
the the protocol is already there
there's just an additional layer that

1698
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:43,599
there's just an additional layer that
 

1699
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,630
there's just an additional layer that
need to be

1700
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:44,640
need to be
 

1701
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,829
need to be
written to

1702
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:45,839
written to
 

1703
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,630
written to
kind of absorb that data and pay for it

1704
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:48,640
kind of absorb that data and pay for it
 

1705
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,790
kind of absorb that data and pay for it
which is which yeah i will write

1706
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:50,800
which is which yeah i will write
 

1707
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,710
which is which yeah i will write
actually i'm thinking about that already

1708
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:52,720
actually i'm thinking about that already
 

1709
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,470
actually i'm thinking about that already
for a few weeks now

1710
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:54,480
for a few weeks now
 

1711
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,069
for a few weeks now
because i really want to make it and

1712
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:56,079
because i really want to make it and
 

1713
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,870
because i really want to make it and
flex make all sorts of data available on

1714
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:58,880
flex make all sorts of data available on
 

1715
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,550
flex make all sorts of data available on
flex it is very important that it will

1716
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:00,560
flex it is very important that it will
 

1717
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,230
flex it is very important that it will
be decentralized

1718
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:02,240
be decentralized
 

1719
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,190
be decentralized
because then the regulator

1720
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,200
because then the regulator
 

1721
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,750
because then the regulator
as you may know regulator already acted

1722
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:07,760
as you may know regulator already acted
 

1723
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,710
as you may know regulator already acted
upon

1724
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:08,720
upon
 

1725
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,589
upon
a decentralized protocol so like less

1726
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:11,599
a decentralized protocol so like less
 

1727
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,589
a decentralized protocol so like less
centralized protocols which tried to do

1728
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:13,599
centralized protocols which tried to do
 

1729
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,670
centralized protocols which tried to do
the same thing as you know there were

1730
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:15,680
the same thing as you know there were
 

1731
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,870
the same thing as you know there were
several protocols who got subpoenaed by

1732
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:18,880
several protocols who got subpoenaed by
 

1733
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,750
several protocols who got subpoenaed by
scc because they

1734
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:21,760
scc because they
 

1735
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,230
scc because they
they started trading regular assets on

1736
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:24,240
they started trading regular assets on
 

1737
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,430
they started trading regular assets on
the blockchain

1738
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:25,440
the blockchain
 

1739
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,670
the blockchain
so therefore it is very important that

1740
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:27,680
so therefore it is very important that
 

1741
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,390
so therefore it is very important that
the provision of the service

1742
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:30,400
the provision of the service
 

1743
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,990
the provision of the service
uh and

1744
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:32,000
uh and
 

1745
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,710
uh and
it will be decentralized and then the

1746
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:34,720
it will be decentralized and then the
 

1747
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,829
it will be decentralized and then the
service

1748
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:35,839
service
 

1749
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,270
service
that it's um based upon this data like

1750
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:39,280
that it's um based upon this data like
 

1751
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,710
that it's um based upon this data like
the provision of the data is centralized

1752
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:40,720
the provision of the data is centralized
 

1753
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,470
the provision of the data is centralized
and the the service of the data is

1754
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:42,480
and the the service of the data is
 

1755
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,550
and the the service of the data is
separated from the provision of the data

1756
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:44,560
separated from the provision of the data
 

1757
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,990
separated from the provision of the data
the service that you built on top of

1758
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:46,000
the service that you built on top of
 

1759
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,710
the service that you built on top of
that so the asset itself like the this

1760
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:48,720
that so the asset itself like the this
 

1761
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,470
that so the asset itself like the this
synthetic part of it

1762
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:50,480
synthetic part of it
 

1763
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,950
synthetic part of it
in the decks is completely decoupled

1764
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:52,960
in the decks is completely decoupled
 

1765
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,589
in the decks is completely decoupled
from the data provided by the oracles

1766
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:55,599
from the data provided by the oracles
 

1767
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,390
from the data provided by the oracles
and has completely different like uh

1768
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:58,400
and has completely different like uh
 

1769
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,829
and has completely different like uh
governance

1770
00:37:59,829 --> 00:37:59,839
governance
 

1771
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,310
governance
and both also decentralized right and

1772
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:02,320
and both also decentralized right and
 

1773
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,230
and both also decentralized right and
then and then it's also decentralized i

1774
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:04,240
then and then it's also decentralized i
 

1775
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,870
then and then it's also decentralized i
mean it's only dex then in this case

1776
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:06,880
mean it's only dex then in this case
 

1777
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,030
mean it's only dex then in this case
like what do you do

1778
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,040

 

1779
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,349

okay so someone is providing some data

1780
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:13,359
okay so someone is providing some data
 

1781
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,910
okay so someone is providing some data
someone else is smart has a smart

1782
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:15,920
someone else is smart has a smart
 

1783
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,030
someone else is smart has a smart
contract

1784
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,040
contract
 

1785
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,150
contract
that

1786
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,160
that
 

1787
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,750
that
you know make it trading on the on the

1788
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:19,760
you know make it trading on the on the
 

1789
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,430
you know make it trading on the on the
data possible and what do what you're

1790
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:21,440
data possible and what do what you're
 

1791
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,790
data possible and what do what you're
gonna do i mean

1792
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:22,800
gonna do i mean
 

1793
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,310
gonna do i mean
it's impossible to

1794
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:24,320
it's impossible to
 

1795
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,710
it's impossible to
to prevent this right so

1796
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:26,720
to prevent this right so
 

1797
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,030
to prevent this right so
um so i think this is very important and

1798
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,040
um so i think this is very important and
 

1799
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,550
um so i think this is very important and
i think that i will propose some

1800
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:30,560
i think that i will propose some
 

1801
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,589
i think that i will propose some
extension

1802
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:31,599
extension
 

1803
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,910
extension
later on of course when once this is

1804
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:33,920
later on of course when once this is
 

1805
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,470
later on of course when once this is
finished to to allow such thing as an

1806
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:36,480
finished to to allow such thing as an
 

1807
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,910
finished to to allow such thing as an
extension to the oracle's data

1808
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:39,920
extension to the oracle's data
 

1809
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,829
extension to the oracle's data
and that will provide i think additional

1810
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:41,839
and that will provide i think additional
 

1811
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,589
and that will provide i think additional
nice fit nice

1812
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:43,599
nice fit nice
 

1813
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,589
nice fit nice
kind of uh possibilities still your

1814
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:45,599
kind of uh possibilities still your
 

1815
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,430
kind of uh possibilities still your
question of the monetization it will

1816
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:47,440
question of the monetization it will
 

1817
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,870
question of the monetization it will
provide additional monetization for the

1818
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:48,880
provide additional monetization for the
 

1819
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,310
provide additional monetization for the
validators to

1820
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:50,320
validators to
 

1821
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,829
validators to
provide this data

1822
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:53,839

 

1823
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,589

very good

1824
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:55,599
very good
 

1825
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,630
very good
okay guys

1826
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:58,640

 

1827
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,870

any questions

1828
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:02,880

 

1829
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,910

please no uh okay let's move on

1830
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:07,920

 

1831
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,710

here

1832
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:08,720
here
 

1833
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,190
here
actually basically i'm almost done just

1834
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:11,200
actually basically i'm almost done just
 

1835
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,550
actually basically i'm almost done just
uh the last slides are mostly about the

1836
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:14,560
uh the last slides are mostly about the
 

1837
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,150
uh the last slides are mostly about the
current situation we already discussed

1838
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,160
current situation we already discussed
 

1839
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,510
current situation we already discussed
it so phase one is currently uh has been

1840
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:19,520
it so phase one is currently uh has been
 

1841
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,710
it so phase one is currently uh has been
completed

1842
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:20,720
completed
 

1843
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,670
completed
so

1844
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:21,680
so
 

1845
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,109
so
it's a

1846
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:23,119
it's a
 

1847
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,470
it's a
partial implementation of nervous

1848
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:24,480
partial implementation of nervous
 

1849
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,349
partial implementation of nervous
validate and uh and oracle's mechanism

1850
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:27,359
validate and uh and oracle's mechanism
 

1851
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,270
validate and uh and oracle's mechanism
so for phase 2 we propose oxygen

1852
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:29,280
so for phase 2 we propose oxygen
 

1853
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,550
so for phase 2 we propose oxygen
direction

1854
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:30,560
direction
 

1855
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,670
direction
and

1856
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:31,680
and
 

1857
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,150
and
phase 3 the last

1858
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,160
phase 3 the last
 

1859
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,589
phase 3 the last
the rest of the project

1860
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:37,599

 

1861
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,630

so also looks like

1862
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:40,640
so also looks like
 

1863
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,150
so also looks like
currently we need to

1864
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:44,160

 

1865
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,390

explicitly uh

1866
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:46,400
explicitly uh
 

1867
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,470
explicitly uh
address some issues that arise and your

1868
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:48,480
address some issues that arise and your
 

1869
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,950
address some issues that arise and your

uh so please add those parts and we can
 

1929
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:07,190
uh so please add those parts and we can
uh hopefully launch the contest today

1930
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:07,200

 

1931
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,430

for coin design i mean it should be i

1932
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:09,440
for coin design i mean it should be i
 

1933
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,829
for coin design i mean it should be i
think um the from the currency

1934
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:11,839
think um the from the currency
 

1935
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,589
think um the from the currency
