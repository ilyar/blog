a very motivating simplified tool to get

1170
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:36,720
a very motivating simplified tool to get
 

1171
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,430
a very motivating simplified tool to get
into the ecosystem and start using evers

1172
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:39,440
into the ecosystem and start using evers
 

1173
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,269

crypto wallets inside the game but it
 

1179
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,350
crypto wallets inside the game but it
works the gamified way so first you

1180
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,360
works the gamified way so first you
 

1181
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,710
