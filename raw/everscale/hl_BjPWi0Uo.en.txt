okay
so maybe let me start from from a couple
of kind of philosophical remarks and
then i'll hand over to sergey and
or maybe somebody else from the alliance
to to give a more detailed answer
about the ever scale never price
so i mean just on the bigger picture
what happened it's it's very clear with
the overall market there was an
extremely intense injection of liquidity
in the last
few years and particularly in the last
couple of years since quite time
like 40 percent of all printed dollars
were printed in the last couple of years
and of course that liquidity was going
all over the place including in the
crypto segment uh there was my safe
injection of liquidity in the crypto
segment
and which which is a risk asset
so when basically us reversed the
quantitative easing and stopped
injecting money into the market of
course
everybody became risk averse and
liquidity started going away from the
from the global markets from the stock
market and of course uh
the crypto market typically reacts first
because this is still one of the most
volatile and risk assets so that's one
kind of big reason the reason why crypto
fell more than the stock markets for
example
is uh
is partially because it's a more risky
asset
as is judged by the investment banks
for now
and uh partially because of the terror
crash
and current terror luna crash and
current celsius crash which is happening
which might trigger some more you know
negative waves
and of course sever is the part of the
global market as you could see our
trading volumes and uh grew recently but
i'm sure sergey will comment about that
or somebody else so of course uh we're
now more kind of linked uh as they were
more linked with the you know more
correlated with the crypto market so
that's why we fell more or less
professionally proportionately with the
market so i'll probably stop at this big
picture remark and hand over to
sergey and team to give more comments
yeah yeah for for brock's it's not first
and not second crypt of winter in uh
first crypto winter brooks was
establishment
in second crypto winter broxles grow
from 25 people up to 100 people
and
in crypto inter it's
more cheaper to hire new people like a
new developer especially
and also marketing repair activity
activities
became
um
five six weeks cheaper too
so uh for us it's um
it's good time for for marketing uh
because now it's not too expensive like
it was five six
uh months ago
uh in terms of security yes uh liquidity
went away from a lot of the fire
protocols but
from fulfilling for example
maybe ten percent uh liquidity was went
to another network and that's all
uh so we were included in the nuclear
terms we are very stable now
about about price about price of course
it's impossible to go against market
because
a lot of a lot of people
sold all actives
and i use it to cover position
with
with margin level
to be safe from argento but they didn't
save
and they lost a lot of money
um
it's uh began from from therap crash uh
near
10 maybe 15 million acres were sold
to alien security
uh and in the first time and uh with
money i went to terra protocol and uh
and bern
[Laughter]
and um
it's it's about past sorry about it's
about future
uh we are we are developing uh a lot a
lot of things and uh
uh
the sad they start to grow uh because uh
teams
in korea
got new partner in japan it's one one
big news
uh
another about
about korea
when
we will solve problem regulation we will
continue to grow in this country
and from august uh we will be you know
within no indonesian market uh because
uh we need to
uh crypto licensed in indonesia and the
f8 we will be able to go to all changes
and we will able start to work with all
the different financial partners
uh so of course i'm not happy to with
current uh
error either on price levels
but if you will compare ever to ethereum
everywhere now it's more stable than the
pharaoh
uh so we will continue to attract
attractivity uh maybe we will set up
some special program from new equity
providers
in bridge
and
we will continue work and attract
attract new people in the team
we establishment
i don't know how to call it
free funds already invest different game
fire project
and we want to invest to
a project on the scale too
and
we will announce a no solve structure in
two weeks
because we need time to understand how
to create structure between these three
funds and our department structures
and uh it will bring
liquidity for projects who are working
on the different games
and who will who will use every scale
technology for it
so it's updates from some from my side
nikita vladimir do you guys wanna
jump in on the minergate site
uh yes i i i wanted to say a couple
things uh you know first of all
um
of course it is uh very very hard to
grow
in the bearish market and now everybody
is
you know everybody agrees that now the
market is uh
bearish and uh
again as alex said in the beginning
a lot of people close their crypto
positions to
basically fill in the gaps
uh of
uh
you know investment gaps in other
spheres and traditional finance and
everything so yeah people sell and
that's normal um but again as uh also
sergey said that
it is um
now time of opportunity because we've uh
in order for us to be top 100 in market
cap
in terms of um like based on coin market
cap and coin gecko we need to have a
price of about 30 29 to 30 cents that
means we will reach the top 100
list which is uh more uh you know
than reachable because again of course
the market was higher in itself but we
had a price of 35 cents just the
beginning of
just the beginning of
may
also if you
follow our social media you've seen uh
we've gotten uh another uh a couple of
mentions and articles in uh coin
telegraph with an article in
entrepreneur and we actually had
very good um native integrations with
coin market cap
um as maybe some of you seen if you open
core market caps made page on the top
you will see
uh every scale uh article from our
uh gravity account
uh in the suggestions so we finally
reached actually and it's actually
natively so
um
that is uh because the engine of
suggestion engine of course market cap
decided to
feature our article and our account on
their main page
that means that
again we do not expect
super rap growth
and
during the bearish market but we
expect
to reach top positions
in the time where
a lot of protocols and a lot of projects
basically turn to zero but we grow
little by little and you know when the
next
uh
bull
uh wave should occur and it should occur
uh 100 just a matter of which you look
her you know in a month in a year maybe
in one a half years we will catch the
wave and uh
[Music]
you know basically
uh
you know collect the fruits of our work
uh that we did in terms of programming
in terms of marketing in terms of
promotion in terms of working with the
community so yeah the times are quite
harsh but
uh we still are making some progress and
uh i mostly i think that's that's also a
good thing
that's from my side
okay
looks like it's my turn do you hear me
well by the way
okay great so um
two in simple words
how to explain to crypt
people what happened on the market it's
very simple
liquidity
went to
united states dollar staking
so since taking rates in dollar terms
now increased i mean this is the
fed rate uh so liquidity
moved there from all others
okay regarding update what we have what
we do in everex
for the last probably half a year there
were not much
communication probably from our side
because very hard protocol updates were
under development and
we know that
probably uh we got some comments from
communities that uh probably have a lot
of
sufficient communication from our side
uh but on the last week i uh called
ama
and
said
i can repeat it again that so first of
all we are actually in line with the
road map which is on
everscale.network website and i think
that in a couple of weeks we will update
uh that roadmap uh with more details and
i hope hope that probably will be able
to deliver some protocol updates uh
sooner than uh
not soon but
sooner than
it was expected in the roadmap
so just to
[Music]
be
[Music]
to to
stress out where we are
again so we are still uh by architecture
by design the most scalable uh ever
first of all in the world
uh
the current market the current system
market is not
still probably appreciate
that approach much because uh there's
still a lot of
forks i mean people start application by
running
like cosmos for example for
some
uh
ethereum
four or four uh index four
four four chains
but from as as as we said uh many times
we think that it's not a sustainable way
for crypto to grow
uh because if you think there's the
whole uh principle of uh
the whole idea behind uh crypt the
stress applications uh disappears by
that
if you have
different blockchains okay you can have
bridges but
bridges
they do not make
applications composable it's just
a way how you can
[Music]
quite
it's quite quite time and uh
inconvenient way to connect some
applications but you cannot
make
application which will rely on um
on number of different applications and
we cannot do it especially in an easy
way
so in the long term approach which we
promote which means all applications
which should be based on one scalable
platform it should win
no way that it will happen the other way
and all uh and and as we saw all um was
about that you probably you don't need
sharding you can do it uh
you can do it uh
a single chain they are not working so
we we saw
selena crush and we see now how it
worked
and
we said it many times before that
uh it's not possible to handle uh
high load and
even handle one
huge application with single chain
blockchain and when you say about
ecosystem of different applications
which
which composed
and and there are some applications
which use
strength of different applications then
it's absolutely impossible to do it that
way
so we probably will have some um
we will have uh one more ama on
technical development site in couple of
weeks as i said once we will update our
plans and our specifications of what was
done during the last
[Music]
half a year
uh yeah and probably will be able to
answer questions uh we can answer now
questions if you have them uh
but
it will be much
much more details in a couple of weeks
and just on this one by means of
introduction we have on the call
slavonicatorina
who respectively are heads of the node
and sdk teams just in case somebody
wants to
dig a little bit into the products and
their perspectives
hello
so what's your take should we get into
jump into questions do you want to ask
yourselves first or do you have any
friends from the community
uh yeah there's uh there are a few
questions from the community and uh the
first question is do ever eats and
brexit has resources to fund operation
uh seven development uh during beer
market for one two years worst case
i could start with rx of course we'll
continue financing all the necessary
work uh
including upstream
i assume brooks was judging by what
sergey said that he's hiring now i think
that answered that question as well
so yeah i guess
i said that now it will be cheaper
than ever
from the second one there were two or uh
yeah there's um
one more questions uh about
about the funds uh because community
many times asked me in the chats uh what
the current situation responds uh when
will they come
roman can you review please
i think it's going to be the funds
coming
than ever
yeah i think it was
it refers to
crystal hands problem i guess ah
uh vladimir can you comment on that
please
yeah yeah hi hi can you hear me
[Music]
uh yeah we can yeah
yeah good good so uh the the current
update is that the consensus has ended
we've been introduced to more or less
old top tier western funds we're also
talking to a couple
funds in asia so now we're just i'm
having meetings practically every day
but then you find the beer market is of
course
complicated the issue but i hope that
anyway
after the market recovers we'll have
introductions keep going on especially
with current prices i think it will be
easier for the funds to enter into
our ecosystem so i'm pretty confident
positive
the outcome of
our talks
uh
thank you uh the next question is uh why
does every scale only goes down together
with the market but never up
i can try to answer that uh
first of all it is actually
uh not true um
about going down
usually most of the time it goes down a
little bit less than most of the
altcoins first of all
uh second of all people still remember
the
bull market of end of 2020 beginning of
that
we didn't catch unfortunately and that
was the the the actually the only
uh situation where the markets just had
a rise and we didn't so
um it is actually not true
it is true that we have actually
told the token price fell uh
quite a lot from the initial
price uh that were
listed when we got listed on the changes
maybe maybe it is uh just um
you know the price discovery at that
time maybe was just a little off but
um
actually now we became
correlating with the market and uh
i think that's more a good thing than
the bad because when uh
when the token doesn't uh
you know the price of the token uh
doesn't have any correlations with the
market usually it scares off investors
because it usually means that there are
manipulations in the market with our
situation it is uh fair and square
you know we
now are just a normal participant of the
crypto market so
i don't see that as a problem i see that
as a plus that we correlate but again we
try to uh
uh
have correlations that you know we we
rise a little bit more when the market
rises uh fall a little bit uh more or
less than one american falls so we just
were working on it but again the
correlations i think it it's not a bad
thing
thank you i think sergey wanted to add
something he got
yeah yeah i wanted yeah i wanted
something
yeah from start of uh
it was not in a scale it was free tone
a lot of token distributed not right
hands and these people didn't bring any
value and during during some months uh
idiots and some
crystal hands investors bought this
talking from market
for
iphones for the last maybe for six
months and
it was not clever to
to
to try push price uh because uh in the
english time uh with this guy still
result
and they stopped sold i think near to
near to april because they sold all
stockings what what we had and uh
affected our blocked all tokens for for
three months
and uh maybe we will uh
we will propose continue cliff
uh to the listing with tokens to not
distribute new tokens to the market if
everything will support it
uh
and
in may in may demand and supply was was
normal and we start grow
and the fate unfortunately alone
happened and
crypto winter happened and now
we are moving like like
thank you i think that we've got the
full answer uh there are additional
questions uh that um
uh
will be uh
a burn of 1 billion tokens
from the treasury if not
for what they will be used for
about about about about historical
uh maybe it's a good idea to burn some
of treasury
uh but we need to calculate all our
network obligations and uh check the
future spawn
uh because erdogan stopped uh sorry
because we're downward for all partners
and all uh
initials now we know all obligations of
network and uh there are a lot of free
tokens maybe five maybe six hundred
million
and one of strategy how to use this
token it's freeze was talking different
liquidity
for example one of my idea is set up
a pair
behavior to establish and freeze 200
million tokens uh
in this liquidity and bjorn will be
talking
uh this token uh i will not be allowed
to withdraw for for for any people
because that will be in
only because it will be freeze in
infinity
but this liquidity
will bring failure for ecosystem because
it will be able to
change your stability
vice versa
and um
and maybe it may be it will be possible
using saviors for another project too
and uh my idea is freeze up to 300 maybe
more millions of tokens in the video and
beyond petroleum
yes and there to that so there are
also possibilities like
uh
to
use their remaining tokens to stop
emission there was discussion let's
discuss some time ago to stop the
mission and use andreas tokens to fund
to fund
validators
so it means that that will be limited
supply and there will be no growth of
supply over the time
uh
this is one idea how you can use that
billion also the billing can be used as
for stable coin
can be done that way so there's a number
of ways how those tokens can be used for
the benefit of the ecosystem we'll add
tvl by the way in the ecosystem and will
not go to the market schedule
just small remark for me uh joint
joining in uh surrogate bible is that if
there is a way
the token said well you're not hitting
the market it's actually preferred way
because when you burn you decrease the
fully diluted market cap as well so if
there is a good there is a good idea how
to spend those tokens it's a better way
for the holy diluted market just a small
remark
uh if i may also when you you know
like in corporate finance
you have to see
what the uh
capitalization table looks like
and if a project has too much
liquidity
locked in the treasury so basically very
big total supply compared to circulating
supply
and vice versa when you don't have any
overhead
that's not actually a good thing
we have um now about 40
of our total supply locked
and about 60 in circulating supply
actually most of this replacement is
also long but locked on the validators
and everything but the treasury is about
800 million tokens i believe if i'm
mistaken
and
that is a good thing that means that
we have some overhead to development
we have some
overheads you know two to
new investor rounds and everything but
again
um
we do not want to mess up the
capitalization table of the network
because you know burning tokens from the
definition is
the process that can not be reversed
if we you know burn the tokens actually
as we did from five billion to two
billion it's a reversible process we
cannot basically create
extra tokens uh using a magic wand so
all these
uh you know manipulations with a total
supply should be done super super
carefully um and uh
because it can actually lead to a lot of
negative stuff
uh if again if the
people propose to burn more tokens
now it will do from my point of view it
will do more hard than good but again
all these manipulations with total
supply should be done very carefully and
if we decide to do something we will
calculate it uh very carefully and show
the calculation to the human difference
i think i think uh people ask for them
beyond recognized because
in in reality we want to not allow to go
new tokens to market and yes yes yes it
is we know only one way beyond but it's
right now way
uh and uh like with the liquidity
and your competitions how to bring value
for ecosystem and
not allow uh
way how to how can still go to market
yes yes correct so basically now the is
the question not of decreasing the total
supply is decreasing the free flow
there's the free flow does the problem
say i agree yes yes so uh yes and and
actually how to deal with free float
it's a very
not so easy question but yeah we as the
file
alliance are thinking about it
constantly because this is the main
problem
uh yeah uh there's another question uh
who are the current investors in
everscale will be there disclose it
or not
um i i'm not sure that we can disclose
all
but for example uh i want to
i want to bring three investors and uh
all of you guys
first
investors to ethereum
one of these guys chinese
and
another guy living in canada and another
guy living in indonesia
uh to
the new network
and this is very very smart money
i think uh
guys more smarter than a lot of funds
yeah i just want to echo sergey is that
we would you know some people who bought
through otc who bought on the market
there's an early guy from bitcoin who
bought in a couple of months ago but i
don't think they would prefer their
names to be called the as you know
typically you know people prefer to be a
certain extent anonymous but
the answer is that sergey started and i
want to finish the answer is that there
is more smart money coming in and
important people from the
large crypto ecosystem coming in
uh like i know if you obviously sergey
knows a few already who came in and
there will be more to come
think that's
the most
uh
kind of thing the most
adequate answers that can be given to
this question
yeah i agree
somebody is writing to me roman just to
give you to breeze somebody is writing
to me why huobi and
kuko and listen did not help the price
they helped the volume
translating but they did not help the
price i don't know sisters you want to
comment i think you kind of answered but
maybe you have a specific
one yes i think we
they don't help with price because uh
a number of uh deposited neighbors uh we
are more than buyers and that's all it's
all about demand and supply
and
a lot of a lot of people
who are want only buy and sell on this
thing
didn't earn and
they saw tokens
and that's all
and uh
maybe if not
if not luna and not another market uh
it's it
probably will help but not in this stage
market
there is another question regarding the
partnerships that
that already passed the ever dow or not
past
what the current status of it and what
will be
future steps
yeah about about partnerships
uh first station of the awards it was
about uh
to continue on not continuing uh
partnerships and uh more than half
partners from seventy way and uh they
will never get tokens
all partners
or
who
allow behavior down to continue
partnership
will uh
prepare and move report
about their kpis and
any any value of what they bring for
network maybe it was not in kpi
uh but uh battery life network
and afraid uh all tokens should be
approved by everdao to move any tokens
from treasury
it's new process
so all partners who
who bring out failure are able to
create proposal to get tokens for it
value
another additional question uh regarding
the 4b and coupon
when there will be a native uh native
blockchain uh added not a rapid
rapid ever
yeah uh one exchange commitment do it in
july
uh second exchange commitment do it in
august
uh usually exchange you need to spend
up to one month's average to do it
i actually want to add that uh hobie and
kucoin were the major ones but now uh
we're in the process of listing on the
malaysian and indonesian platform coin
store
which is uh quite popular in the region
uh that also listed first on erc20 token
as here's what it took and after a month
or
a month and a half we will have a native
listing because again not
um
everybody is still familiar
about however skill works so they have a
learning curve
to to to integrate natively but you know
the more
the more exchanges we have the faster
the integrations will
will become
um yeah for now it's
no more questions maybe someone wants to
add something
i think we kind of cover it cover it all
i uh i just want to remind while
everybody is thinking that we have our
weekly call in 25 minutes so
there will be more presentations so
there's nice presentation on the gaming
front uh with the company which is
getting a lot of traction currently so
i'm inviting everybody to join the
booklet communicable otherwise
guys ladies love just joined recently
maybe he wants to say a couple of words
yeah guys just just to say hello
for some reason i saw the notifications
that it should be in half an hour
so what maybe you want to invite uh
people to participate in our hackathon
and build great
yes so actually so we're planning uh to
announce this this week
so we are going to host uh the first uh
in a row of hackathons called broxas
elysium
uh so hopefully uh by end of the week so
we will share the website uh
with all the tasks and all the uh
details about the hackathon so it will
be both in offline and online
form so
any remote participants are also welcome
and
so
we planning to make such hackathons
uh
kind of uh regular so with an objective
of having them at least quarterly
and preferably much much more often
so uh and we of course will be grateful
for any kind of your feedback and help
so and if anyone is willing to to become
a mentor for teams so please contact me
directly and so of course
so we will uh appreciate any help
duke dubla do you want to comment
briefly on the bridges on what's the
latest what's maybe coming um on the
overall region infrastructure because
that's one subject we didn't touch yet
in the school
uh yeah actually so the
nearest feature to to come so maybe
let's just stop uh
on the recently announced features that
have been released so uh the uh first
and major one is the merge of the tokens
meaning that now you can
match
several tokens from different networks
being
one and single token
and this way you can easily control uh
your
the whole flow of your tokens
for your user base
and
easily
transfer them from any network to any
network so if they follow the merging
procedure so we will announce the merger
procedure so soon
hopefully within a week so it will
explain who we should contact with uh
which proofs and which information
should provide
so
to be able to merge
your tokens in different networks for a
bridge to operate it natively
and the next uh
closest feature to come
is a bridge
to solana so it is 95 percent ready and
now we are passing the security check so
and also looking for auditors
so and very soon uh
we are expecting it to be released so
this way salana will also become
connected to
everscale
yeah so db
yeah
hey and welcome to hitler how are you
finished
now
i'm talking about major features but
also you will see some a lot of
good ui tweaks now interface
so maybe you have seen that we have
recently launched the landing page
of the of the bridge shown some good
stats uh so quite a lot of mining
improvements are going on uh time to
time
or just keep subscribe to our news
channel so and if you're missing
something so please
contact me or any other guy from the
team and just we are collecting the
feedback from you guys and of course
taking it into account and playing the
future releases
and maybe on our end on every expert
we'll cover it on the core products i
just also want you to briefly comment on
flex and bosch of course
i guess everybody had a chance whoever
has interest to see the may uh the
killer whale podcast to be more precise
on gosh where a lot of questions were
cut out and answer it from my personal
standpoint it's developing quite nicely
there is interest
from some senior at industry folks and
there are quite a few ripples were
already deployed in gosh but i don't
want to steal from mickey's territory so
i let him
give precise numbers at the next
occasion
uh
and on flex you might have seen that
there was an announcement that flex
would be launched on june 1. there is
good news happened to flex it got
strengthened to the team substantial
service transitioning to the team
with some you know some experts from the
space um
from the trade in slash deck space
and there was a decision taken to
add more features and polish uix so
that's why flex is getting uh again new
features and then more pollution will be
launched a little bit later so that's
two cents on on our end on the rx on the
key product
anyone else who wants to say something
or any more questions wrong otherwise i
mean let's uh get to work
yeah markets we need to get back to work
yeah get back to work and yeah see you
on the weekly meet up
thank you all see you bye-bye thank you
