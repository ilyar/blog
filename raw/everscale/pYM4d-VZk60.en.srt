00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,360
according to
 

495
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,190
according to
for example if users uh has a debt an

496
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
for example if users uh has a debt an
 

497
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,430
for example if users uh has a debt an
amount 50 usdt

498
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
amount 50 usdt
 

499
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,629
amount 50 usdt
uh then

500
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
uh then
 

501
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,069
uh then
a liquidator has to pay this 50 usd back

502
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,079
a liquidator has to pay this 50 usd back
 

503
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,030
a liquidator has to pay this 50 usd back
and you will get

504
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
and you will get
 

505
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,750
and you will get
plus eight percent for doing that

506
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
plus eight percent for doing that
 

507
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,910
plus eight percent for doing that

your collateral at some point you can be
your alone can be

774
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,120
your alone can be
 

775
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,830
your alone can be
too risky to stay on the platform so it

776
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:47,840
too risky to stay on the platform so it
 

777
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,789
too risky to stay on the platform so it
can be liquidated so you'd rather

778
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
can be liquidated so you'd rather
 

779
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,830
can be liquidated so you'd rather
have a big collateral and don't go with

780
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840
have a big collateral and don't go with
 

781
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,430
have a big collateral and don't go with
your risk level too far away or
