hi all
[Music]
my name is mithya garashevsk i'm cto of
don labs a core developer of freetown
network which is currently
the fastest and most scalable blockchain
in the world
but the topic of my today's
talk
is
some challenges building decentralized
internet
and i named it
building decentralized internet and not
just a decentralized application or uh
or a blockchain decentralized
is because
we believe that
it's not enough just to build a
financial decentralized financial
application or decentralized financial
backbone
um we believe that
we have a problem of centralization of
the internet today and um
just give a brief example why do i think
it's not such a good idea
simply because
the laws of evolution tells us
that we would not be sitting today
if if the evolution process would be
centralized
meaning
people
or species doesn't matter they tend to
make wrong decisions sometimes
and sometimes these wrong decisions
are just deadly
so imagine if the evolution
where
all this pieces would reach one decision
i think this this business would live
very very short
time
because simply because they would make
her some wrong decision and they would
be all dead
so we need to allow
this process where
a lot of groups
a lot of people species that reaching
different decisions in a decentralized
way
and
now
how do we do that
and of course bitcoin was the first to
build
such a such a network where
where it allowed for the first time uh
for
people who joined the network
to not need to trust each other
and there is no point of trust in
blockchain
in a public blockchain and that's
exactly why i think private blockchains
are just meaningless just it's just a
wrong branch of an evolution
of the technology
okay so
if we have a trustless network
so of course satoshi wanted this network
to be financial
uh
backbone to to provide for trustless
finance
and
in a developed this way all the way up
to today
but in parallel to this
there is there is an internet right
there is a larger internet there are
where users
are putting their data on they have
applications that they're running right
and this
internet
evolution
it made just an opposite direction
completely it just went to the opposite
direction
where it started to become monopolized
by very few entities and i'm talking
about google i'm talking about you know
facebook and so on
in this
um this monopolization of course is
wrong on in the market because like
governments around the world are trying
to fight monopolization all the time
because the market becomes inefficient
while in the internet it went this
direction
be and it went with this direction
because every market actually if you
don't regulate the market it will sooner
or later become monopolized because
simply because that's the motivation of
the party the motivation of economic
parts in the market is to grab as much
power as possible in the way of revenues
right that's what the enterprise is
optimized for is making revenue
same thing when you allow
the internet
um
to develop like the businesses on the
internet these businesses will will tend
to monopolize in exactly like in any
other market and that's what we are
witnessing today so right so we have the
internet which is a bad one of all the
data and all the human knowledge which
is monopolized by very few parties
and i i don't think this is such a good
development
if you think about the evolution
and process we described in the
beginning
so
for that
we thought okay so let's we have
industrialized technology we have a
technology like the backbone like the
database and we can run an applications
on this database now
um and it's a it's decentralized meaning
the parties don't need to trust each
other so why wouldn't that be good idea
maybe to put these applications that
just just not just financial application
but basically any application
or at least some
portion of this application which which
requires that to put that part in a
decentralized way
on a decentralized network so
what would we need to do to even
technically to allow this kind of
thing right so first of all
it is it it must be
the demand on this on this backbone is
would be huge right because
it um there are millions of people who
are using internet today there are there
are like millions of applications which
which which the internet is is uh
um is used for
so what kind of requirements would we
need to talk about here if we want if we
want this i will share my screen now
for a second
and uh
let's see i just put one it's not even
slight
um
to do that
so
i put four kind of four properties of
this of this back one
it need to be
fast it need to be secure it needs to be
something we called
valuable and sustainable
available right sustainable
um
i will briefly go for all of this
um and i believe that all of them are
required
right so
so first of all it should be fast and
fast of course is a kind of
not precise word but um let's
just break it up so it need to be low
latency and by low latency i mean if you
go to like social network and you
refresh a page or you put a post you
don't expect that you know um post to
appear in
in an hour
or and even in 20 seconds you you like
hit the button you wait one two three
well that's it i mean that's more or
less the span of user uh kind of um
ready to wait for this to appear on the
on the website so it should be really
low latency stuff
then it should have a very high
throughput because like there are a lot
of these users potentially who would you
know want to do that simultaneously
so
we talk about let's say twitter
right
so twitter has like i don't know 20 30
000 transactions per second just just on
there on their feed
around the world and uh
and they on the high peaks like it can
have to like what 60
000 tps
right
and it should be infinitely scalable
because if i want tomorrow to develop
new application i can define i'm an
entrepreneur or developer i wrote some
application and there are millions of
users suddenly want to use it like i
wrote the tik tok or whatever and there
are millions of users want to use it
well this network should scale with that
right so it should be like almost
infinitely scalable because we don't
know how many of this application would
appear
now then it should be really secure
because if we don't do that secure and
i'm not talking about only financial
first it's a very bad like if you have a
financial application which is not
secure but even if i'm not talking about
financial application
just you know you're putting all your
data and we know that
right now you put all your data in the
hands of like google or whatever
and um
and and we and of course that is exactly
the power of the of their monopolization
because like they have this data now
they can use that data to sell your data
basically and so on and so forth
so user need to be in control of of its
data if we want really to decentralize
the internet
in order to do that you need to be
secure like there's no of course
arguing about that
what we call millable is is is something
nasim taleb called
scientific
it's um
it's basically what happens to
um
if you want
this system to like say you want to
upgrade this system
right
who is deciding what need to be upgraded
and and should we put your code on it or
not right if there are rules of the
protocol um who decide
how this rules changes if we need to
change them
and we need to change them to adopt
simply for you know future growth or
needs or bugs change whatever
and if you look even at the bitcoin how
they do that
um
the repository where bitcoin repository
code is centralized today
so
presumably it's just it's just not
it's just not decentralized enough of
course there are like governance
structures which are like community
governance structures that may be
decentralized
um
but until the point where you make all
of it decentralized and also in such a
way where
um this decentralization kind of
is upgradeable
meaning if if tomorrow community changes
the network should not stop and the
network development shouldn't stop right
so you need some kind of rules
governance rules which would be which
would be flexible which would be
anti-fragile
and the last thing of course you need it
to be sustainable because if it's not
sustainable nobody will support it right
so if you if you have a validators on
the network you have you have more
miners whatever um right you need an
economic system
where um
doesn't matter what happens
it will always be profitable to to run
your network uh of course if the users
are there if the users are not there
then
yeah well
nobody needs the network
right
and the last point is it should be
sustainable in a way that where the new
entrepreneurs
like developers want to join the network
do something on that it should be it
should provide some incentive for them
to do that
and so i think that
more or less this is the framework this
for me
this is the frame of for like to
building
the
this decentralized internet now if you
look today and just
take that framework
and apply it to any blockchain that you
know
today and you will see very quickly
that
there are no blockchain today which
actually
um
fits all these points
right so
there is simply no
no protocol today which allows for
creation of decentralized internet yet
and they all of all of the protocols
they have like their
good side their strong side something
that they do really well like for
example you like there is a huge
community of developers on ethereum
and
you know they write a lot of solidity
smart contracts
more or less they all of course copy
pasting but that's not the point so you
have this a lot so they like
the ethereum to teach us or
taught us that you can you can write
applications on the blockchain
but um
the network itself is just not
scalable at all so when we thought about
that framework um
we thought that this is the design that
goals that we have right so
and of course i'm not going to talk now
about how how we tackle that and that's
not the point when you can check it from
freetown
node organs and technical papers and but
there are
of course all basically many blockchains
trying to solve that
problem
um of like but
again you need to talk
about this whole complex of these
problems because if you just solve one
you will not build a centralized
internet you may build decentralized
finance yes but you won't build
decentralized internet
nor a backbone for decentralized
internet um so for example you can have
a very like fast blockchain fast meaning
like low latency high throughput
but if you don't have governance um
which is which is decentralized and you
don't have it's a sustainable economy
then that just won't work
now when we talk about our design of
course with these goals
we kind of
it changes a lot the perspective of what
you're trying to do for example like
if you if you take one chain solution
and you just built very fast chain but
you will still have um scalability
issues because it's not infinite then
you can then you quickly realize okay
you can build a very fine um order book
uh kind of um decentralized exchange but
that's about it and because you will hit
the limit upper limit of your of your
scalability which will be i don't know
even few hundred thousand tps but then
it stops so how would you do the next
one if you do if a developer comes to
you and say okay i have another
application and i need another million
transaction per second more or less
what you're going to do
[Music]
so um
[Music]
so so we need this infinite scalability
and the infinite scalability you can
only build
with well it's you can't even build it
with sharding
because you will build just
um
scalability but you won't you won't do
that fast and because like if you just
shard every all the time
it won't be low latency for example
so there are compromises in each step
and if you think about security for
example if you share it a lot
and you don't have a consensus which
which provides security guarantees which
are you know
built for sharding if you don't solve
that the sharding the security
guarantees for charging which is really
hard
then then you cannot have sharding
because you won't have security right or
you simply jeopardize the user security
if you have sharding and i'm talking
about layer 2 solutions for example and
all that
and you can build layer 2 layer 3 layer
4 what you have today more or less kind
of a solution but the problem is that on
if you go for all these layers for the
user and i'm talking web3 which okay so
let's say layer one um network which
provides security currencies layer two
network which provides the scalability
layer three now which which provides
like a user interface we're going
through this whole web three stack if
you just connect all these pieces
together
if you hit a button
it will take you like i don't know how
much time like it's it's it's not you
simply cannot
you need to think of a system that would
have all these components tied together
in one kind of network
layer one
and because without that you you simply
cannot hit all these design goals
just they're very simple um kind of
stuff right
um
then and then you have all this
decentralized governance and in the
economy in which i i don't even want to
start to talk about now because we don't
have time for that
so
anyway
just for a conclusion
this is the framework i'm thinking about
when i'm thinking about like the next
generation blockchains
this was our design goals when we
created ours and i think that you need
to check every well i check every
blockchain or every kind of
infrastructure solution
um in the blockchain space today against
these principles and if it doesn't fit
then i say okay fine it has a limited
like scope of that or that which is fine
i guess
um but well our goal was to build a
decentralized internet because we think
that there is a problem with the current
one
thank you very much
and you know see you again
