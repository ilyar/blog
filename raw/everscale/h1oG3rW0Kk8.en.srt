like
 

175
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,550
like
this is on top of the patches that we

176
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
this is on top of the patches that we
 

177
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,749
this is on top of the patches that we
planned to

178
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:19,759
planned to
 

179
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,670
planned to
and deployed there so we deployed

180
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
and deployed there so we deployed
 

181
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,749
and deployed there so we deployed
patches that we need to test in order to

182
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
patches that we need to test in order to
 

183
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,350
patches that we need to test in order to
upgrade mainnet

184
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
upgrade mainnet
 

185
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,390
upgrade mainnet
we've

186
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
we've
 

187
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,870
we've
then we've we kind of faced this problem

188
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
then we've we kind of faced this problem
 

189
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,550
then we've we kind of faced this problem
with the with the

190
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
with the with the
 

191
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,909
with the with the
contracts and some contracts on the

192
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
contracts and some contracts on the
 

193
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,030
contracts and some contracts on the
devnet

194
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
devnet
 

195
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,110
devnet
started to fix this

196
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
started to fix this
 

197
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,070
started to fix this
so

198
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
so
 

199
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,870
so
created more instability the network

200
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
created more instability the network
 

201
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,110
created more instability the network
halted today

202
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
halted today
 

203
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,710
halted today
during our tests

204
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
during our tests
 

205
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,110
during our tests
for some 20 minutes or something

206
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
for some 20 minutes or something
 

207
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,749
for some 20 minutes or something
um we've been able to restore it

208
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
um we've been able to restore it
 

209
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,150
um we've been able to restore it
and we'll continue to

210
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
and we'll continue to
 

211
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,469
and we'll continue to
apply certain patches

212
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:52,479
apply certain patches
 

213
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,070
apply certain patches
um it's a it's a general like these

214
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
um it's a it's a general like these
 

215
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,550
um it's a it's a general like these
things are

216
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:57,560
things are

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,390

kind of

00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
kind of
 

221
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,990
kind of
deficiencies in the original

00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,749
that
just

228
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
just
 

229
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,350
just
just uh weren't yet fixed and

230
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
just uh weren't yet fixed and
 

231
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,629
just uh weren't yet fixed and
they're they're

of the platform
 

239
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,469
of the platform
like very deep

240
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
like very deep
 

241
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,150
like very deep
uh kind of for example very deep uh

242
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
uh kind of for example very deep uh
 

243
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,990

trees

244
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
trees
 

245
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,590
trees
sell trees and so on

246
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
sell trees and so on
 

247
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,909
sell trees and so on
um

248
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
um
 

249
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,070
um
and that that imposed some limits on the

250
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
and that that imposed some limits on the
 

251
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,390
and that that imposed some limits on the
on the block collation

252
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
on the block collation
 

253
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,710
on the block collation
uh which fails and so on and so um

254
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
uh which fails and so on and so um
 

255
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,830
uh which fails and so on and so um
with

256
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
with
 

257
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,270
with
it's hard things to think to fix because

258
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
it's hard things to think to fix because
 

259
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,909
it's hard things to think to fix because
it is um

260
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
it is um
 

261
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,150
it is um
usually like this kind of changes should

262
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
usually like this kind of changes should
 

263
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,029
usually like this kind of changes should
be

264
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
be
 

265
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,550
be
structurally

266
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
structurally
 

267
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,390
structurally
planned ahead

268
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
planned ahead
 

269
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,390
planned ahead
but because it happens right now we

270
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
but because it happens right now we
 

271
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,230
but because it happens right now we
cannot plan ahead so we have to fix it

272
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
cannot plan ahead so we have to fix it
 

273
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,430
cannot plan ahead so we have to fix it
now and that's what we are doing

274
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
now and that's what we are doing
 

275
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,830
now and that's what we are doing
but it's kind of hectic a little bit

276
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
but it's kind of hectic a little bit
 

277
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,189
but it's kind of hectic a little bit
so

278
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199
so
 

279
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,990
so
that's basically it it delays our plans

280
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
that's basically it it delays our plans
 

281
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,469
that's basically it it delays our plans
on main net upgrade because of this

282
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
on main net upgrade because of this
 

283
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,790
on main net upgrade because of this
because we cannot test properly without

284
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
because we cannot test properly without
 

285
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,950
because we cannot test properly without
fixing the devnet first

286
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
fixing the devnet first
 

287
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,189
fixing the devnet first
so again this this cumulative patches

288
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
so again this this cumulative patches
 

289
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,629
so again this this cumulative patches
switch up which a huge patch already

290
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
switch up which a huge patch already
 

291
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,230
switch up which a huge patch already
by itself uh

292
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,240
by itself uh
 

293
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,990
by itself uh
will be even larger

294
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
will be even larger
 

295
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,070
will be even larger
now and obviously

296
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
now and obviously
 

297
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,110
now and obviously
you know

298
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
you know
 

299
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,150
you know
i'm kind of looking at it

300
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
i'm kind of looking at it
 

301
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,830
i'm kind of looking at it
philosophically because sooner or later

302
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840
philosophically because sooner or later
 

303
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,990
philosophically because sooner or later
we would need to do that anyway

304
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
we would need to do that anyway
 

305
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,970
we would need to do that anyway
but uh

306
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:30,980
but uh
 

307
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,230
but uh

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,990

it never happened in real life like it

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
it never happened in real life like it
 

311
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,550
it never happened in real life like it
never happens in the

312
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
never happens in the

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,990
never happens in the
in the

314
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000
in the
 

315
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,710
in the
timing that you think you need it to

316
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720
timing that you think you need it to
 

317
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,990
timing that you think you need it to
happen right it's just events of real

318
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
happen right it's just events of real
 

319
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,590
happen right it's just events of real
real life

320
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600
real life
 

321
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,629
real life
um so yeah so that's what we're doing

322
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
um so yeah so that's what we're doing
 

323
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,950
um so yeah so that's what we're doing
and because of that because we couldn't

324
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
and because of that because we couldn't
 

325
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,070
and because of that because we couldn't
update

326
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
update
 

327
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,110
update
upgrade

328
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
upgrade
 

329
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,309
upgrade
this the network in a planned fashion

330
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
this the network in a planned fashion
 

331
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,390
this the network in a planned fashion
like we did the upgrades but we couldn't

332
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
like we did the upgrades but we couldn't
 

333
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,589
like we did the upgrades but we couldn't
um patch them

334
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
um patch them
 

335
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,870
um patch them
in time we're delaying the

336
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
in time we're delaying the
 

337
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,110
in time we're delaying the
uh obviously the things that we had to

338
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
uh obviously the things that we had to
 

339
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,629
uh obviously the things that we had to
do in the first quarter which is the

340
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
do in the first quarter which is the
 

341
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,550
do in the first quarter which is the
decrease of fees

342
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
decrease of fees
 

343
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,629
decrease of fees
the gas fees and uh because we cannot do

344
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
the gas fees and uh because we cannot do
 

345
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,350
the gas fees and uh because we cannot do
that before we move to the to before we

346
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
that before we move to the to before we
 

347
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,830
that before we move to the to before we
apply all the patches that we worked on

348
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
apply all the patches that we worked on
 

349
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,629
apply all the patches that we worked on
so

350
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
so
 

351
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,909
so
so once we do then then we will go and

352
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
so once we do then then we will go and
 

353
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,870
so once we do then then we will go and
and deal with the gas fees

354
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:24,880
and deal with the gas fees
 

355
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,350
and deal with the gas fees
so more or less that's the status

356
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
so more or less that's the status
 

357
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,589
so more or less that's the status
uh there is a question i think ron posed

358
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
uh there is a question i think ron posed
 

359
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,589
uh there is a question i think ron posed
me yeah

360
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
me yeah
 

361
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,390
me yeah
dark rules something yeah i mean uh the

362
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
dark rules something yeah i mean uh the
 

363
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,110
dark rules something yeah i mean uh the
question is basically and uh i had to

364
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
question is basically and uh i had to
 

365
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,790
question is basically and uh i had to
paraphrase it so it's uh what's better

366
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
paraphrase it so it's uh what's better
 

367
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,909
paraphrase it so it's uh what's better
you know i don't think you can answer

368
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
you know i don't think you can answer
 

369
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,070
you know i don't think you can answer
that but uh what's better or what will

370
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
that but uh what's better or what will
 

371
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,230
that but uh what's better or what will
be launched first uh is it going to be

372
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,240
be launched first uh is it going to be
 

373
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,869
be launched first uh is it going to be
boosted staking or dark pools and then

374
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879
boosted staking or dark pools and then
 

375
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,710
boosted staking or dark pools and then
of course when and i think when they're

376
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
of course when and i think when they're
 

377
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,550
of course when and i think when they're
talking about boost staking they're

378
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
talking about boost staking they're
 

379
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,469
talking about boost staking they're
talking about version two i mean i can

380
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
talking about version two i mean i can
 

381
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,990
talking about version two i mean i can
answer that when it's voted on but uh

382
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
answer that when it's voted on but uh
 

383
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,189
answer that when it's voted on but uh
yeah i mean

384
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
yeah i mean
 

385
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,070
yeah i mean
one's uh technically technically

386
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
one's uh technically technically
 

387
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,510
one's uh technically technically
i don't think it's a question to me

388
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
i don't think it's a question to me
 

389
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,589
i don't think it's a question to me
because uh

390
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
because uh
 

391
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,589
because uh
dark foods and boosted sticking are not

392
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
dark foods and boosted sticking are not
 

393
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,670
dark foods and boosted sticking are not
one or another dark pool is a technology

394
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680
one or another dark pool is a technology
 

395
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,749
one or another dark pool is a technology
booster staking is

396
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
booster staking is
 

397
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,270
booster staking is
an outcome

398
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
an outcome
 

399
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,510
an outcome
how do you achieve boosted staking it's

400
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
how do you achieve boosted staking it's
 

401
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,950
how do you achieve boosted staking it's
another

402
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
another
 

403
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,110
another
completely another question

463
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,829
fashion and that will
may include the boosted staking and you

464
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839
may include the boosted staking and you
 

465
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,310
may include the boosted staking and you
can stake in what what is what is uh

466
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
can stake in what what is what is uh
 

467
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,550
can stake in what what is what is uh
dark pool is a you take

468
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
dark pool is a you take
 

469
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,750
dark pool is a you take
something for for the period of certain

470
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
something for for the period of certain
 

471
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,509
something for for the period of certain
years or whatever

years or whatever
 

473
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,990
years or whatever
and then you have a grace period in

474
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
and then you have a grace period in
 

475
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,710
and then you have a grace period in
which someone else like the governance

476
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
which someone else like the governance
 

477

which someone else like the governance
can can put a

478
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
can can put a
 

479
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,710
can can put a
second leg

480
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
second leg
 

481
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,350
second leg
like put the boost into your

482
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
like put the boost into your
 

483
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,310
like put the boost into your
stake

484
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,320
stake
 

485
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,750
stake
that's it

486
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
that's it
 

487
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,790
that's it
and so

488
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
and so
 

489
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,470
and so
so you can

490
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
so you can
 

491
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,550
so you can
you can use this contracts to to do

492
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
you can use this contracts to to do
 

493
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,790
you can use this contracts to to do
whatever you want in terms of like

494
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:02,800
whatever you want in terms of like
 

495
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,150
whatever you want in terms of like
farming or boosted whatever you call it

496
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
farming or boosted whatever you call it
 

497
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,150
farming or boosted whatever you call it
but i know there are other boosted

498
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
but i know there are other boosted
 

499
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,190
but i know there are other boosted
staking

500
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
staking
 

501
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,949
staking
kind of contracts i have no idea how

502
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
kind of contracts i have no idea how
 

503
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,269
kind of contracts i have no idea how
they done because i never it's not

504
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
they done because i never it's not
 

505
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,710
they done because i never it's not
something that i did

506
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
something that i did
 

507
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,550
something that i did
so no idea maybe there are other

508
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
so no idea maybe there are other
 

509
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,990
so no idea maybe there are other
contracts that you can use for booster

510
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
contracts that you can use for booster
 

511
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,389
contracts that you can use for booster
staking again the decision is

512
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
staking again the decision is
 

513
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,310
staking again the decision is
like the governor's decision

514
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320

515
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,670

program
 

519
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,590
program
they want to launch when

520
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
they want to launch when
 

521
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,550
they want to launch when

two transactions in the batch but it's

872
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:21,760
two transactions in the batch but it's
 

873
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,350
two transactions in the batch but it's

uh
 

875
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,549
uh
but it's about uh for example we're on

but it's about uh for example we're on
 

877
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,669
but it's about uh for example we're on
uh one batch and it will do

878
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
uh one batch and it will do
 

879
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,310
uh one batch and it will do
two operations two transactions and so

880
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
two operations two transactions and so
 

881
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,750

will be later announced in the chats of
everscale and now we are on the stage of

896
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
everscale and now we are on the stage of
 

897
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,950
everscale and now we are on the stage of
testing

898
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:56,960
testing
 

899
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,350

uh htlc contract on every scale and by

902
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,280
uh htlc contract on every scale and by
 

903
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,710
uh htlc contract on every scale and by
the way now i think on teslas too

904
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:06,720
the way now i think on teslas too
 

905
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,990
the way now i think on teslas too
um

906

yeah because uh this presentation was
 

909
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,830
yeah because uh this presentation was
prepared to the hackathon as i mentioned

910
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:13,840
prepared to the hackathon as i mentioned
 

911
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,590
prepared to the hackathon as i mentioned
before and at this time we don't have a

912
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:17,600
before and at this time we don't have a

team was uh created fully
 

923
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,710
team was uh created fully
during their hackathon uh so now we have

924
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,720
during their hackathon uh so now we have
 

925
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,990
during their hackathon uh so now we have
some users which are involved in every

926
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000
some users which are involved in every
 

927
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,909
some users which are involved in every
scale in developing another scale and

928
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:45,919
scale in developing another scale and
 

929
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,029

1041
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,590

uh yes uh i will make this moment clear

1042
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,600
uh yes uh i will make this moment clear
 

1043
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,549
uh yes uh i will make this moment clear
uh when we prepare this

1044
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:16,559
uh when we prepare this
 

1045
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,549
uh when we prepare this
uh presentation uh it was created by the

00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:28,240
yes uh this contract but now we have and
 

1051
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,230
yes uh this contract but now we have and
yes the uh breach can be run only with

00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,240
yes the uh breach can be run only with
 

1053
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,909
yes the uh breach can be run only with
uh two uh htlc contracts

yes i can say for sure that everyone can

1086
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,400
yes i can say for sure that everyone can
 

1087
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,230
yes i can say for sure that everyone can
run the bridge and

1088
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:16,240
run the bridge and
 

1089
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,110
run the bridge and
it's open source and will be open source

this bridge operator uh

1096
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:29,840
this bridge operator uh
 

1097
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,830
this bridge operator uh
better to

1098
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:31,840
better to
 

1099
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,990
better to
better maybe to to to ask alfalfa galaxy

1100
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,000
better maybe to to to ask alfalfa galaxy
 

1101

yes
 

1103
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,669
yes
in that respect i see that there are no

1104
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:39,679
in that respect i see that there are no
 

1105
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,470
in that respect i see that there are no
consensus so any relay can confirm any

1106
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
consensus so any relay can confirm any
 

1107

custodians of this multistick so to
 

1131
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,190
custodians of this multistick so to
perform some operations we need for

1132

perform some operations we need for
 

1133
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,390
perform some operations we need for
example

1134
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,400
example
 

1135
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,310
example
we have 12 breach operators so it's 12

1136
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,320
we have 12 breach operators so it's 12
 

1137

00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:23,679
that means that to
 

1141
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,950
that means that to

don't remember

1152
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:35,919

 

1153
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,269

about this

1154
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:37,279
about this
 

1155
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,789
about this
number i mean of

1156
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:38,799
number i mean of
 

1157
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,669
number i mean of
science so to perform some operations we

1158
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:41,679
science so to perform some operations we
 

1159
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,950
science so to perform some operations we
need to

1160
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:42,960
need to
 

1161
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,669
need to
to reach these consensus and

1162
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:45,679
to reach these consensus and
 

1163
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,070
to reach these consensus and
for example have

1164
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,080
for example have
 

1165
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,830
for example have
paid signs

1166
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:49,840
paid signs
 

1167
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,950
paid signs
for

1168
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:50,960
for

operation
 

1171
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,110
operation
it's very strange

1172
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,120
it's very strange
 

1173
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,870
it's very strange
we mean that

1174
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:56,880
we mean that
 

1175
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,750
we mean that
you mean you need a number of science

1176
00:24:59,750 --> 00:24:59,760
you mean you need a number of science
 

1177
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,070
you mean you need a number of science
signatures to initiate

1178
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,080

one chain then on another chain

1182
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:07,279
one chain then on another chain
 

1183
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,269
one chain then on another chain
it should be

1184
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:09,279
it should be
 

1185
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,430
it should be
executed automatically

1186
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:13,440

 

1187
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,909

because again it uh what you said it

1188
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:15,919
because again it uh what you said it
 

1189
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,510
because again it uh what you said it
it's a bit contradicts to the con

1190
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:17,520
it's a bit contradicts to the con
 

1191
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,669
it's a bit contradicts to the con
concept of httlc because you need only

1192
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:19,679
concept of httlc because you need only
 

1193
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,470
concept of httlc because you need only
one secrets to release as shall see

1194
