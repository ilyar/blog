feel free to interrupt me anytime joe
though you want to get going okay yeah i
think that's a good intro thank you very
much
thank you
i think we're at capacity now we've got
everybody here very cool so hi everybody
welcome to the everscale community call
and we have a lot to share with you
today we talk about the nft uh the
african nft marketplace that's going to
launch a hackathon and a lot more
uh and you've probably seen that um in
the chats today uh the grand bazaar
merchants collection was kicked off they
announced it and they're releasing uh
an exclusive collection of 3333
a lot uh unique nfts cool number
uh which give holders access to this
collector's club which is really cool uh
the merchants look awesome themselves i
see that uh some people are already
starting to gobble them up
um
so don't forget that they have this glb
file format you could toggle on this
view so you can actually interact with
the nft see it in 3d move it around
which is really cool
and if we have uh yeah pavel here pablo
smirnoff yeah hello if you want to jump
in and say a few words about the
merchants collection yeah thanks
everyone and uh
yes my name is pavel i'm a community
manager at grand bazaar and as you
already mentioned yeah our team just
launched our the first part of this
merchant collection that will includes
uh 10 000
merchants in future at this season we
just launched 3
33 merchants
and this merchant will be something like
our mascot that will appear in a future
weekly news post twitter
posts and other other stuff like that
so
this collection have a lot of
interesting utilities such as airdrop of
our future native token gbt
grand bazaar features uh wetlands to
collections from our uh launchpad
section
and as you already mentioned yeah
this is the first collection based on
every scale that provides jlb format
and you
in other words you can fully interact
with your merchant with your nft and as
one of the our
community members
mentioned today this is the first step
to the everscale
multiverse
[Music]
yep
that's also my that's that's something i
was thinking of as well very cool thank
you for for sharing that um if you
haven't seen it yet go into the chats go
to grand bazaars social links check them
out there's some really cool
3d interactive nfts
very cool
um so also there has been some great
activity in the event space recently our
own alexander felitov ceo of everex was
at synopsis and he spoke on a panel
discussion about nft
the past present and future i'm not sure
if you want to share a few words about
that alex or
if you want to jump in
i mean i think it was a nice panel it's
obviously very tough market that we're
seeing today in nft um the
the uh
kind of key key point was that you
cannot just continue doing you know
generative collections you've got to
bring gamification you got to bring the
utility aspect of your nft so the market
is evolving to a more uh two more let's
say
more advanced forms than it was during
the crazy you know 2020 2021 run so
that's kind of a
one-minute debrief of the key outcome
cool yeah it was online event too so
anybody can can watch it i think the
streams are going to be on youtube do
you know about that
yeah i think so i think they will post
that
the calibri group
who does the synopsis will post it
on youtube
very cool
we also had brian c from broxas he was
representing everscale at nft nyc
and everscale's own mark feldman spoke
at the unicom startup in bali
he presented everscale to the audience
created some buzz around flex
and
after the conference and panel
discussions there was a blockchain
startup competition where mark also
opened up this second phase of the event
so we've had some pretty good visibility
over the month
um i can
probably assume that most of you are
watching the charts like maniacs
recently uh if you notice that btc
bitcoin is up about six percent this
week that's
that's some positive news right maybe
it's going to hit 24k soon depending on
market sentiment
amid you know
the whole lingering worldwide economic
turmoil and whatnot
uh so things might start to turn around
soon and on that positive note we can
move on to some tech
tech updates by pavel who would like to
share some things powerful
thank you john
so i'll
do a quick update so as
many of you know
that
uh yesterday quite important
um
thing happened
uh
so we have we have now in mainland only
one chart and we had 16 before
um this is why it is important
uh
actually
that
decision
uh was
promoted uh for quite a number of months
by the fire alliance uh because they uh
uh
said that uh at a current condition with
a low load from on the network it is
important that
uh
smart contract change when we have like
chain of uh executions they uh if they
pack in one block in one sharp then uh
it moves much faster than
when when uh those uh that chain of four
contact executions is spread between
different charts
so they asked to do it because
it will show
much
better
latency for users and this will help to
promote every scale
so there were some
discussions technical concerns about it
but finally
they were resolved and yesterday that
happened
um well this is the main
change what
we had
uh during the week
uh there was also
okay it's not it wasn't may there was a
kind of family
on
[Music]
sunday on sunday uh where there were
discussion uh was coming into about uh
plans
and
i said there that this week there will
be
uh some main contributors to the scale
will have a meeting
about architecture and
we will discuss there
some uh some
other important decisions one of them
will discuss uh gas gas peace reduction
and also we'll discuss and we'll discuss
by the way selection as well so like uh
when and how we should
launch this session because we only have
uh
electronic slashing
so
i i think that as a result of that
discussion
we'll probably
um
release some notes about
that and also the discussion will uh
should
result in
priorities
or what
k contributors
see
for development
development
uh so it will end up in the roadmap
because we have a number of updates
which are under development
um
now going on in parallel but it is
possible to develop to develop
in parallel but it is impossible to
implement them and to launch them on
mainland so we should have some priority
so after that we'll have much more clear
road map on when we will get water on
the front
okay great thank you pavel thank you
very much do you think you can come on
um
maybe
to every call and give give some brief
tech updates
i just want to uh throw you into the
fire and ask you to come on every time
every time
to get some tech updates
yes i can again
i hope that only i will do
updates
next time but anyway somebody
somebody will be available yeah sorry i
was out of the city today and was very
bad connections
no no problem i appreciate you coming on
but vladimir is great too just so we
have some tech updates that's live for
the community so everybody can see
what's going on they'd be great and uh
open to asking questions i think that's
ivan with the eye
do you have a question
about media involvement in the
development of node
i didn't hear your question sorry
i i think i got
a question about michigan how which is
involved in mod develop
is it correct
i don't think his connection's very good
yeah
what about his involvement in technical
okay
i think i got to try so yes so michi is
uh involved of course uh he is part of
architectural committee
but
now he is involved more on strategic
level rather than operational level
uh we have um team leaders which exactly
know what to do and they have their own
scrum process with
planning
standups and
review
so each
we have
four teams inside the favorites
and actually
i think at some point they
should come on
community polls as
uh well
i i think that
sometime
several times participated
at least sdk team lead
victorina
fantas she definitely was on community
goals i think but probably
on the next connection
we can
they can
just
do quick introduction
i think it was also
helpful for the community
that's a good idea
okay i hope that answered your question
ivan uh we've got to move on the agenda
here uh we have john keny here from the
ever scale african subgov to showcase
the community's first nft marketplace
called amara it is a development project
geared towards african culture and its
content creators
so please welcome john and we're eager
to learn more
thank you zero for giving me this chance
to address the community
um today
the african uh everscale africa team is
pleased to present the first complete
use test
since uh branding to evacuate
without
much ado i think i'll go to the parts
they after maybe can have that in that
do the actual presentation
is it possible for me to share my screen
you should have rights let me know if
you can't
okay
okay great we see it
you see it
okay thank you so
i'm just going to go briefly
on what
the mother is all about
what the community has agreed on
our philosophy
and
our target audience
and obviously the projects that are
going to be carried out within the mara
itself
so
to begin with
uh imara is a
ever skill network
initiative that is the african community
initiative
which intends to tap into the rich and
diverse cultures within the continent
and of course
enhance
everscale brand
so
our main part of the application is
running on the blockchain on everscale
blockchain
apart on the website and part of the on
the ever still
network
uh we are also using uh
evos as the main
currency that will be working within
the mark
so this
is the first finished project
we intend to
launch it
this coming month
it's also the first project we are doing
since the
branding of everest
we have carried out some research
uh as we continue developing the
marketplace
and we have found out that
we have very many participants in
other
ethereum based
marketplace
and as such
they are very much interested in
having a localized marketplace
uh which they are ready to join and put
in their products
so of the features of imara um are
slightly
uh different from
they are more less like what we have but
they have some additional features which
i'm going to spread
spell out
uh one
the marketplace is
uh
targeting the
african artists
and defense of the art lovers
and obviously the lft
participants within within the african
continent
we also have a unique referral system
whereby
we have team leaders within uh
for art promoters
fans friends not just the
creators of the content
but we also you can also have
a referral system whereby we have the
promoters who will come in and set up
a
kind of a business structure
with the referral code
and uh
on a living so it's more or less like we
are building a a business whereby people
can come in whether you are an artist or
a creative or just just a business
person you can just come in
and have your own lineage
and uh
and from from from from the system
uh the other uh unique feature we have
is uh that we are targeting to
uh have some kind of uh
a team a thin based
uh collection whereby we have
uh a certain
uh
let's say a certain
topic
for a certain
feature photography
[Music]
images to do with the
landscapes
we are looking at
the wildlife
we are looking at the national parks
we are looking at the history
of different countries like uh we have
54 countries in africa so we can have
sections that are dealing with
individual countries and
some of the proceedings that are going
to be coming from
those projects
we will be able to assist
the communities within
we have philanthropic courses
that target specific
communities when we
have topics related to those particular
cultures
and so on
finally
we have
a road map that we have tried to
[Music]
follow
we had
the infrastructure creation
then which we followed with the
engagement of
the energy enthusiast and
on the social networks
we have been able to interact
with various uh
participants within the nfte
as we continue developing the network i
mean i mean the the platform
and that's why we have most of the data
and
obviously being inspired on what we need
to do
uh we have also been conducting
[Music]
uh
this month and of course
ongoing we will be
still engaging the community on how they
will they will engage with yamara and
what kind of
topics and
and the projects that they need to do
uh of course
the next thing we are doing
this coming month is
starting on the marketing
we have created the social pages
we have done
marketing posters we have also
created different teams we have the
marketing team we have the
community support team
we have the advertising and
creative department we also have the
trainers
who will be carrying out the
the training
as as new participants join us
so we are on the process of developing
our uh
social media platforms
that will assist all these people
to
be able to engage in different levels a
technical user user experience and staff
that comes to the end of my presentation
to add on to this
we will be engaging with
the javascript
define alliance
uh for
assistance in the next financial year
which we believe will begin on first of
july
to be able to
finance some of the activities in
marketing promotions
and
further development of our of of imara
i'll give the this opportunity to that
winduct to take us to the platform
itself technically
thank you
thank you for giving me this class
so
i will run now
my screen demonstration
so you can see our wonderful marketplace
the registration is very easy now we
connect with
every valid
in our roadmap for also
plan to add other reddits
to the marketplace
so connect now
uh after connecting
to the marketplace we can go to the
we have by the way we have some
nfts right now here
uh as john mentioned
uh we have started uh we launched it in
product
some weeks ago
uh
and one of very interesting things from
our marketplace its referral code
it's very i think it's the first
marketplace in every scale with a such
referral system
uh what it means uh to be sure
uh
everybody who will register with your
referral code
you can write it here
enter someone as a referral code by the
way we expand
profile
profile fields too you can add your
email instagram twitter and discord and
these things are very important for
artists because they want to share their
social
platforms like for example instagram or
twitter where they publish some updates
so you can enter here your
some one referralcad or code and
this member
will get two and half percent of all
your sales it's very good strategy to
attract uh not only users but somebody
who will work and attract more users to
this platform
so as you can see i fill my profile a
little bit
so let's uh we don't have a lot of time
that's why let's go to the creation the
creation is very easy too
i will
choose one of the images
we have wonderful cropper
why it's wonderful because
you can see it's a square
that means that all the images on the
marketplace will be the equal size and
it will
it looks great
so
let's
something like this
we can choose the category let it be
masks
something like this
we can create collection i have created
some of them and then we press just
click it
it will
ask to
send some funds for meeting
let's do it
and the process of meeting of meeting is
start
we need to wait as always for some times
to meet energy
while we are waiting
next i will show you that we also have
auction logic on our marketplace and
buying logic 2. i will show it later
let's give us some time to meet
after meeting it will be automated
automatically to automatically reload
the page
so let's wait
um
so we start some of the data we store in
ipfs uh we choose uh
by the way i like the idea to store
everything in chunks
but in economically it's not very easy
to calculate because images are
different and so on that's why uh
somehow it's not very easy to calculate
the final uh inverse which we will need
to store the image forever that's why
ipfs is much
better very end
so let's wait
for
meeting
just
uh
it's pretty fast i mean
we just need to wait for
transaction in every scale
and for the
loading all our data on ipfs
so
i can see that we successfully
commenting
let's go to the explorer page
to find our nft i have minted now oh
let's see let's go and
look at the internet
oh you can see that i'm the creator i'm
the owner uh my collection and the
address if we go now you can see every
light
uh we can see this energy and let's do
it for example put on sale
we can enter our price for example let
it be
five viewers
oh sorry i will
uh you can see my scr uh
just a second you can see my uh valid
just second i will do
the full demonstration yes like this
so
let's put it on sale you can see that
everything in smart contracts it's a
magical sale
payment is expected we use some
notification system
to make user be sure that everything is
oh payment has reached
and operation start pretty fast i guess
uh we can withdraw from sale if we wanna
let's do it too
maybe i decide not to
sell this wonderful item
from transaction
again payment is expected
payment has reached and some operations
that pretty fast i guess
and let's put it just we can choose the
by the way we can choose any date as the
end or auction let it be
july
and enter start price
will be for example three years
again we need to sign
because everything is about blockchain
we can see in price
time everything thinking blockchain nice
confirmed transaction
would it be possible to set up multiple
prices because you uh like you could see
from july 1st to the 12th it's going to
be up for sale at this price but then
after the 12th it's going to increase 30
percent to this price can you yes we can
set something like that
yes we have uh when we go to nft we
uh see
the
[Applause]
date of the end and also the current
beat
now you can make a beat and you beat
will be first
so we have all history
uh let me show you
also we have searches system
we can search
as you can see it's pretty fast too we
can search collections for example let's
see my collection
everything is loading from the chain and
everything is pretty fast i guess
uh
so uh
i can see my collections
and
um
[Music]
and so it's by the way we have a
pretty search system where we can for
example
uh see only paintings or only street art
on or only art and so on
and different collection
as you can see everything it is works
nice and by the way we have we can sort
it by price for example or just random
it's some
funny mode when you can run them
sort your nft data uh yes
so that's it
guys girls everything is working you can
go you create we currently we are
testing more dsp testing we signed for
if we will find some bugs we will fix
them uh we use true nft standard of
smart contract we're also looking for
solidification by nft alliance and also
will fix if uh to maybe to some standard
uh
uh and also we will add more uh valids
like uh surf like um scale valid uh to
make a user login
um so i think it's sure but it's all uh
and yes one of the interesting things in
all this logic is referral code because
it gives uh changes to somebody who
cannot create some art but who can
attract somebody who can create art uh
so he can make money
from it too
so
i guess that's all
that is great that's an amazing
presentation amazing project thank you
very much for sharing it with us um
the african continent is just so rich
with unique cultures and art and now you
guys are opening it to the world or at
least you're bringing the world to all
these
beautiful
creations that people are making and
that's that's fantastic i'm really
interested in the referral system
with the code that you have created
uh is there anything
um in the pipeline or on the roadmap
for additional benefits for people
additional
incentives to use this code because i
imagine it sticks with the nft for its
lifetime and it travels with it too
right
uh yes we are blending uh so by the way
you can see i i add my website and it
appears here i also can let's
let's enter something like this um
so you can see my instagram link appear
when i
uh
let something like this
uh
about uh other futures yes uh also we
can uh we are looking to implement uh
some
some methods to for example make some
top tokens top collection maybe a user
maybe we will we can do something like
that user uh
[Music]
can uh buy a place to be in uh to be on
the top to be on the top for example he
wanna
sell something fast he can pay us and
place it on the top something like this
or maybe
maybe john will add something about this
yeah maybe some
oh sorry yes
yeah i just wanted to
to talk about the entire system
uh this is very critical because of uh
most artists
not business people in nature
the referral system also
encourages the influencers
the people who have got their masks in
their social media pages
be able to bring in their following
to this platform
and
in this in the in the process
so the levels of earnings is what we are
currently working on but initially
um
we will have
uh
a certain percentage
uh of the linking fees going to go into
them and also part of the sale sale of
this nfp income percentage will go to
the influencers
this is critical where when it comes to
bringing masses and of course our main
uh our main purpose is to bring a kind
of a community
a long-lasting community within within
this space
the referral system takes care of much
of much of that
thank you
yeah by the way uh
yeah by the way
just for demonstration i create i login
with another valid and
then we'll paste my referral code and
click save
so
i have done it and as you can see once
you enter your referral code it's this
input is blocked you cannot change user
who will be your referral but it's
working and for example if
now you will buy or now show on
my nft this referral user will get two
and half percent of uh the price
i sell
my item
on auction
cool it also gives people uh who are
using these referral codes to kind of
become
micro influencers in a way so
the creators can actually seek out the
top uh referral referral
code users people who are
really having success um
getting some nfts sold
that's right yes for example yes for
example uh you don't know about your
scale now but for example i know about
your scale
and why i need to waste my time to
explain somebody how to go how to mean
how to connect the bullet why i should
do this but now with the referral system
i know that for example i will attract
some artist i will explain him about
trevor scale how he can meet and so on
and he will start to sell his beautiful
paintings on this marketplace and i will
know that uh for every sale i will go
two and a half percent so i will uh so
it will take some time for me to explain
him but in in future i will get uh
for end of my
life
uh i will get uh this two and a half
percent from here
for example
great you guys are opening up some new
opportunities here for people uh ben
you've had your hand up you got a
question or you want to say something
yeah yeah i just wanted to uh give a
brand of kudos to the guys i mean
obviously um
if you go back to uh 2017 and all the
craziness back then there was a
very new uh exchange launched called uh
be nance or something like that and uh
they had a very generous referral scheme
and uh look look where they are nowadays
so you know referral schemes make the
world go round
um so really great work um i wanted to
know are there any plans to implement uh
audio nfts
on the platform
uh what kind of snippets
uh sound audio
uh why not uh we can store uh
it's a good
it's an interesting uh we can try by the
way maybe now uh because you can see
that we have already discussed about mp3
uh as we as we store everything
uh in
iphone data so why not we can store uh
mp3 uh
only thing uh which we should uh
develop here is uh displaying and
playing this audio here it's the only
thing
uh but we can store to be honest we can
store any data
mp3 empire and before
everything to be honest
it's the only question about displaying
on the uh
on the on the marketplace
yeah excellent excellent stuff i mean
obviously spotify have got a big
platform for musicians and nfts plans
coming out in a few months so you know
be good to get ahead of the game and
really uh work out what the kinks are in
this system i think great work again
thank you
fantastic thank you guys you guys are uh
launching the marketplace officially in
early july i think right because that's
when you start your
communications
to get people on board
yes of course we will be sharing our
our social media uh links
and of course we will publish the
uh launch with our
in our telegram groups
yeah thank you great thank you looking
forward to it
uh moving on the agenda we have the
broxas hackathon uh broxas was recently
uh no they recently hosted the elysium
hackathon in belgrade
um it was also an online event for
people who couldn't travel or go there
to location and it was the first
hackathon with developers competing to
win from the 30 000
usd prize pool we have broxah
ceo
thank you
i like how you're saying it about the uh
in the past sense you know in past time
that it
was so actually it's uh it's planned in
july so it will take place in belgrade
yeah yeah so from 14th to 17th of july
and
this will be the first uh hackathon
under this brand subroxas elysium
and
we have
chosen several
several tasks for this hackathon and
it will
consist of three tracks so the first one
is a question excellence so meaning that
uh the teams will compete in writing
cross chain the apps that i use in
october's bridge
the second one is
development for developers
which will focus more on
creation of different tool sets for
developers member scale
so which is uh no never you can never
get enough of those tools and uh
the more you have uh the easier
it will be to onboard new developer
server scale and the third one uh is the
ux ui perfection uh meaning that we will
also
encourage people to create some visually
visually appealing uh
interfaces and applications that are
using
octo's bridge as well so you see that
the main topic for this hackathon is
october's bridge integration and usage
of all of its capabilities
like hidden bridge like uh
[Music]
integration with different networks
and so on and so forth
uh so
we do not
really uh expect uh
too much from this hackathon so although
nevertheless uh we see almost 30 people
have registered already
and
there are still something like three
weeks
but the main objective now is to
introduce everscale and process products
to a serbian community first of all and
also we have started recently
the information campaign
just
across the local community and the
concept of uh broxas elysium is that it
will be
let me name it migrating hackathons
meaning that we will be selecting
different geographies to host it uh to
introduce more
uh
our technologies to local communities
and uh led them tribe the fingertips
how's it to program in the
multi-threaded
solidity and
yeah or synchronous solidity
uh
yeah so all to all to get more uh cool
projects uh to on boards on um
uh on ever scale
and uh now i see quite quite a good
number of uh
people who are coming from different uh
big companies like epam like
uh jetbrains like microsoft
like in driver
uh
and a lot of others so uh the name
expecting and
then more or less 50 50 split uh between
online and offline parts
uh
so i'm really thrilled to see what will
be going on uh and
we will do our best to to
let people enjoy this hackathon
and i hope that we will manage to repeat
it at least quarterly
uh
because the more this kind of events you
have
the better
and i also encourage uh
all people from everscale also to come
to register and also participate in this
this event so the more uh interesting
projects uh we will see during theirs of
the better
and uh also uh if someone is willing to
help us with uh
uh
real-time support for participants of
the hackathon during the days of uh
of the event so you're welcome so and we
are welcoming everyone so we will have
actually uh the support into two form
forms so the first one is offline
support of course for
those who are uh on site
and we will also uh
be looking for different questions and
requests in the hackathon
telegram chat
for people to
to be able to get the information
and i also encourage
current overscale developers to to
create some nice articles and
explanations on the stack overflow
website where typically most of the
developers are coming to find the
answers so i just want to remind you
that we have
the dedicated tech our scale on stack
overflow so please don't hesitate to go
there and
help others
with their questions
um
yeah so
that's pretty it's about about this
great initiative thank you very much for
sharing i like that uh this hackathon is
not just limited to developers you're
opening it up a bit more so
for a wider audience more people okay
yeah so it's it's a point of
communication of uh networking so
there will be the full day where we'll
be
just providing the information about
their skill about
the process products as well
but this will be of course targeted
first of all to developers but also
there will be some people from the
business network
of serbia so and i personally agree
already with several people who will
come and
just
discuss provide information so quite a
lot of opportunities to be there and to
to network yeah
okay thank you um a couple of weeks ago
in the bronx's chat there was an ever
dow cube airdrop 100k was distributed to
active participants was that already
done uh yeah
okay so it's people who uh were very
active in the everdao governance
protocol right
do you want to share any information on
on that
uh yeah actually so it was a
fair fair uh reward to people who were
participating on uh everyday activity so
it was our own initiative so it's no way
linked to
decisions of
labor scale governance of the fire line
so it was purely brock's incentive for
those people who
were actively uh
participating in voting on never down
and
helping us to test it out
and providing available feedback as well
and uh so i hope now most of the
community is
familiar with how to use everdel and
what is it about and
is having a look at it time to time to
see what's going on there
so as you may have seen so it's not only
about uh
putting you know a big stake
to to vote but it's also about
your real uh your real thoughts your
real ideas so and
each vote matters of course and we are
careful tracking what's going on
uh so please continue doing like this
so it's really available for the
community for the everscale at home
agreed thank you
thank you vlad for the update
uh moving on on our agenda we have the
marketing update um
we have a face that's becoming more and
more familiar around here his name is
alex and he's going to be giving us a
little update on marketing in everscale
alex
thanks joe
yeah i will make a short presentation
for that purpose
let me share my screen
here we go
so
like just a couple of shout outs of
what's what's what's been what's about
what we've been up to in june so first
of
all uh is a new publication in forbes
and we managed to get an organic
mention
of our michael gord talking about
bullets
which was pretty nice
uh the next thing that might be of
interest is our
continued work on
point market cup
michael you're kind of a robot right now
i'm not sure about your internet
was it michael
yeah
i think he tried to say something
okay
[Music]
do you want or can you say something
maybe he'll type it but you can continue
yeah maybe so the next thing is our
continued work on uh coin market
michael i think i think you should
probably type it out
oh i think it would be better
[Music]
so
on coil market cap we've managed to make
a good spot on the first page of it as
you can see with one of our articles
featured
also we've made a big update to the
description of what is everscale we've
updated the links
we've updated the text
we've updated the
whole description
and also we've listed uh
a solid part of our ecosystem which is
available to list including uh october's
bridge including flat cube as a bags and
as a talking spartacats ever starts and
we're aiming to
list more ecosystem
tokens
on coin market cap because it's adding
value for everyone at that day
uh
and also following i think we've touched
on it on the previous meeting there was
an ido for reveland a kind of blockchain
moba game which was pretty successful by
the way it was uh like
a little bit with the help of our pr and
uh
communication efforts but uh all the all
the indicators were modding but the one
was pretty high for the tokens and now
it continues with another activity now
in the nfc
sales section of everstart here everyone
can buy a mystery box from
reveland which are which can be be a
cheaper version of it like a normal
mystery box and they're
really rare mystery box
the amount is quite limited so yeah
hurry up if you want to get some
limited heroes and revolut i think it's
quite a good question personally
uh
and
another thing as as june sorry it should
be june i typed matrix increasing july
but metrics will increase further on in
july but
at this point then christian june as you
can see on this charts we've got a solid
increase in the number of impressions
we'll keep on
you know high intensity posting making
almost 200 posts per month and we've got
a little but important raise in the
number of subscribers here on
everscale twitter
as for our website
everscale.network you can see that as a
result of everything we continue growing
steadily
those slightly versus april but if you
compare it with you know march you can
see that the growth is fantastic and
amazingly we've got this
interesting split on uh geography of our
users of our visitors to everscale.net
as you can see
indonesia occupies
the third place here on this pie chart
in the right
which is really good good good good to
know because it comes as a result of a
really massive
pr uh and communication program that we
are doing for indonesia starting with
our event on bali and then further on
with
uh many pr articles published there in
indonesia so
it's great to see the split
and
i think that's more or less it from my
side
awesome thank you very much for sharing
does anybody have any questions
there
the growth looks good
uh
thank you alex um if nobody has any
questions we can move on to
general questions um
alex would you like to
jump in for an ever start question i'm
not sure who else would be able to uh
answer that here the question
is uh
an hour after they were listed on flat
cube they sold their tokens and scammed
regular users
more than they swapped ever to usdt and
withdraw them i've lost 20k evers
would you like to comment
oh
honestly i don't understand
the whole thing what what what i think
i'm also not sure if i mean
if
if it comes to i don't know
flat q functionality they're always a
support and telegram chat where everyone
can ask whatever question and receive a
timely no help
if it's someone calling someone a
scammer i i don't know how can i command
this
i can say that that no one is scammer
here so it's definitely someone calling
someone a scammer that that definitely
that's not true
i think they're talking about uh ever
start but i don't know so maybe if uh
whoever is asking the question they
could
shed some more light on why they're
asking the question and then maybe we
can look into it
other than that i don't know at least
some more details about it because now
it sounds like
you know
but ever ever start is definitely not a
bad actor it's a launch pad that we're
developing
in our everscale ecosystem
okay i have a note here that uh we have
brian uh who would like to give us an
update about nftnyc he was at the event
earlier brian
thank you
thank you guys for having me um and just
to follow up with what vlad said i'm
going to be at the hackathon as well in
belgrade
um so i encourage everybody who can to
attend and if you can in person
definitely do it online
uh we got a lot of um we have huge prize
pools and it's going to be interesting
to see all the all the work and kind of
the new crop of um everscale
developers and broxas
colleagues and all the different uh
people from different spheres networking
um it'll be a great opportunity but yeah
i was in um
i was in new york city last week for ny
uh nyc nft
um
and it was a very cool experience uh
there were like thousands of different
uh projects there
a lot of different celebrities and a lot
of people that weren't in the nft sphere
came out and uh
and got a got a taste for what it's all
about
uh
we met i met with a bunch of different
uh nft cool nft artists that i told
about everscale and broxas and
i think there well there are definitely
a few that want to work with us and i
think a lot are are interested in in the
prospect so hopefully we'll be seeing
some results from from that uh and i
hope that in the in the future we'll be
able to uh have a more solid presence at
these kinds of events i know that
they're doing one in london
um i feel like the everscale team should
definitely look into
maybe putting a stand together getting
speakers to speak at some of these
panels
because uh the awareness isn't where
that where we want it to be at right now
but when i talk to people and tell them
about the
technical capabilities of the network
everyone is kind of
everyone is on board everyone's
interested um what we have the network
is is unique in what it can do and i
think it's really necessary right now
and especially considering the the state
of the market now is a great time to
to push forward and to to get more users
so that when things get revved up again
we'll be in a prime position
um but yeah it was it was a very cool
experience um and hopefully uh we'll be
seeing some some results from that and
hopefully we'll be able to do more more
things like that uh in the future with
uh with more force
definitely
thank you for sharing your information
