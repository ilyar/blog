okay so thank you everyone for being
here for listening to this uh panel
after a very long day of conferences and
fun
uh so my name is pavle batuta i come and
represent i've come from serbia i
represent a company called moonstruck
and we are involved in the everscale
ecosystem as a serbian partner we are
currently building the use stablecoin
which is uh one of the first if not the
first algorithmic stable coins that will
be built on everscale blockchain
and since
we are already on the topic of cbdc's
i'm very interested to share a little
bit in the discussion about
how we can actually create currencies
that are exist on blockchains either
cbdc's algorithmic stable coins or
similar
so
thank you all for for listening who
would like to go next maybe we'll do a
little bit of a remix yeah well let's
just work down the line for the
introductions then we'll mix it up great
good afternoon everybody no uh thank you
for being here with us
don't like uh
right it's been a long day of conference
my name is zahan
i'm a malaysian
but now i'm residing in the middle east
qatar working for an insurance company
and i've been part of the the community
you know
since the early days of the
establishment so it's always a pleasure
and honor um not to be to be back and to
be seeing everyone
so
thank you
okay uh my name is bo uh i'm from south
korea representing a jungle i mean
actually
i'm a c
cbdo of xango so uh zengel is
it actually starts with x not z so you
should be careful of that
and then uh we work with uh governments
and central banks
and all the regulatory uh sectors to
create a better basement uh technology
of uh career and blockchain business
so uh we raise uh we have a rating
system here in work in korean market and
then we're the sole
a rating solution in korean market in
terms of listing tokens
so uh
because of that i meet a lot of token
projects and i talk about like regular
regulations
of course korean regulations and
everything so i
hope i can
like share some information about
this regulatory issue
about on cbdc
thank you
hi i'm david police i'm a
founder of zbx exchange in malta the
smallest country in the european union
for those who don't know where that is
um we also in the past worked with some
governments like the marshall islands
when they tried to introduce their cbdc
and some others so we have consulted and
we're also quite quite large within the
i gaming like online gambling space as a
family business
and also ai
in general as
businesses hello everyone my name is
alex antonov i am an investment director
of algal on capital
it's a hedge fund
and i'm here because i like to think
that i understand a thing or two about
central bank logic
and for national markets so
cool
hello everyone my name is sergey
jorinsky i'm a
co-founder and managing partner at d5
hedge fund called warp capital who is
the initial member of everscale defy
alliance and one of the largest
liquidity providers to ever scale
ecosystem
so i like
cdbcs too so that's my hobby to talk
about it
okay well a lot of interesting and
varied and deep experience so obviously
we're here to to talk about cbdcbcs
and look at where they are now and where
they're going and
sort of where where they fit alongside
stable coins so if we if we start at the
beginning
there's a lot of e-money out there
anyway
um so where does that fit exactly with
digital currencies um
why is there a need for cdbc's i guess
is the question so
why don't we start just this one time
back at that end and then work our way
through so that we've we've set
everybody's sort of
initial opinions of the topic
well
i see the idea of cbd seas which can be
a little controversial when you look at
it in a sense that there is already
money and there's already digital forms
many many digital forms of money out
there
but
an interesting perspective from like a
tech point of view is that money is also
data so
a good implementation of cbdc that sort
of leans on existing blockchains and
existing infrastructure can allow
money to be treated as a data in a
better way it will allow new models of
financial applications both in like web
tree space where you would directly pull
in uh like assets from
money money to assets from accounts and
banks and similar things
and
it would also allow of like the next
wave of digitalization of existing
financial applications so the idea is a
lot of fintech innovation is difficult
and it's hampered by not just
difficulty in like
regulation but also all of these
siloed data provisioning and
sources that come with banks and finance
financial institutions and
a movement towards cbdc's
could actually enable a very
interoperable
world of money
like worldwide over time so
personally i find this very exciting
because
it will allow like across uh uh
cross-chain standardization of uh money
tokens from different countries
you know in a very uh sort of integrated
way
okay
well um
no i guess the the technology has been
studied by many central banks when they
first started and
when they were looking at it before no i
don't think they they were you know
really thinking of how cbdc would become
you know
a system where you would disrupt or you
would replace you know existing
infrastructures but i think it's came to
a point in this time where now now you
have two different so-called categories
of cbdc's right now you have the the
retail side of the cbdc is nowhere where
where the mass you know
public would use and and the wholesale
side where they use it for you know
international settlements so i think i
think more
more banks right now including
the ones in this region malaysia and
singapore have explored
um
doing cbdc's for international
settlements right so i think you know um
and then they have all came together
with uh multiple countries to explore
and how that settlement worked so that's
you know my view on how cbdc is yeah
okay uh
i'm gonna use some uh use cases in korea
because we already have a lot of like
digital payment system in korea
for example samsung
the payment system is all like worldwide
like like widely used in korean market
and then
every time we use it we think about
like samsung being a monster like
seriously
like when it comes to the
reality people always
have to be emotional i mean like you can
talk about technology and logic reasons
but when you choose to take it it's
always emotional that's what i think
and when i talk to korean people who are
who are already using all the payment
system
and then saying like asking them like
why don't you use like blockchain system
instead of using like samsung pay and
then they say like i don't know them
is it like based
is it backup by the government or can i
cannot believe them
so uh
that's what i'm
like if cbdc comes out and then give
people
the trust
what the blockchain really is then we
can actually just like scale it out
well we of course we're going to discuss
about like technology's problem and then
there's the anonymity and everything but
like
in terms of like giving trust
to the people we can always use cbd with
government
that's what i think and then they're
gonna find out all the good reasons why
we have to use it
look let's let's break the problem down
and
and focus the the difference between the
e-money and the cbdc is the issuing
layer one is issue privately the other
one is issued by government absolutely
but you
specific question
and why do we need the cbdc
the thing is who needs it does it does
the government need it or do we need it
i think it's more a question of
on a government level if a government
issues their own cbdc and doesn't adopt
say for example usdt just to to pick one
of the many
they can program the cbdc
which gives them much more authoritarian
powers and people think ah but they're
not going to propose such the bank of
england
recently they it was proposed within the
within within governance that
the one of the ministers addressed the
house of commons says we should think
about making a progress programmable
british um
cbdc so we're not far away indeed but
brit coin as it's been done i mean they
call it they call it the brit coin
if cbdcs are programmed then for the
government there is much more chances of
actually now playing with monetary and
fiscal policy you can go much deeper
into negative interest rates and i don't
even want to go within the current
geopolitical scenario what's happening
with regards to being able to confiscate
money and if you want to talk from a
from an economic point of view obviously
you can incentivize people not just by
um using monetary policy or fiscal by
putting money in the economy but by
making it also ex
putting an expiration date if you don't
spend it by xyz it's going to expire so
you're really
more pumping money into the economy so
the question really boils down to
benefit for who i can see a lot of
benefits for the central government
for the central banks
and but if you talk stable coin versus
cbdc
i can see the
weight scale going more toward centre
banks rather than for individual users i
think all of that is a topic that we're
going to probably circle background
towards the end of our conversation
because you've hit on
a number of very fundamental points
there i think
yeah yeah that's that's really
interesting what uh what you're talking
about uh
somebody called it uh fiscal terrorism
now because uh the government is uh
uh trying to
uh
prevent you from uh taking a rent from
your money from uh collecting a yield uh
so that that's really interesting but
for the audience to follow uh i think we
should explain that what cbdc is you get
free forms of money you got paper cash
you got deposits on the bank account and
you get third form of money it's a
central bank digital currency so where
is the typo here we can pretend that
it's not
uh and with this third form of money you
can do plenty of interesting things uh
as good as bad uh and different kinds
and it's not like uh
you can compare it to stable coins
because stable coins is a digital
currency which are issued by some
private company
and they try to
pack it to
a fiat currency like mostly dollar and
uh cbdc is just
the new form of money for the government
to achieve their goals probably so uh if
you ask me what interesting i learned
about cbdc recently is that
if government benefits from it people
somehow benefits from its because you
can you know send the money without
internet but it's digital money still
you can have uh
more control you can prevent some
corruption schemes
so who lost in that uh
in that new wave of money it's regular
banks because they
uh
lost some liquidity they had before and
they should uh you know do their job
score people provide user interface and
the liquidity goes to central banks
which you uh access directly
so i'll come back to you on a moment
on
specifically on that aspect because
that's sort of already leading us in
into the next question but but first of
all sergey yeah i'll be short
maybe intriguing thought but
cbdc just happened because
there were already stable coins on the
market and people started using it and
uh
if you are not following the best
technology in the world uh then suddenly
your citizen
will stop using your money and that's
the
bad thing for the government in my view
that simple as it is
okay so
um alexi coming coming back to your
point i think
what are the implications of that so
that you've said effectively the loser
in all of that is the traditional banks
so
what
exactly what are the implications for
those traditional banks and the knock-on
effects to the users of the traditional
banks and the markets that they have in
the markets in general
so everybody knows that uh banks use
your money as they want probably they
don't have all the collateral uh of all
the deposits obviously so uh
they use your funds from i don't know
from the ancient greek then they
then you can use like local banker they
won't call
at that time bankers but you can
deposit them money and you can lend them
their money when you deposit they can't
touch it but uh
centuries and centuries they again and
again touched that money uh the
government pushed them to uh provide
free credits and you all know that kind
of stuff
now uh
we have a
like a
the circle go back again and the banks
are losing part of the business if the
if everyone will use
cbdc's
which will be basically
digits in central bank
so bank
lost their liquidity and start to do the
real job and uh that's why in many
countries banks are at the opposite side
of the discussion of that particular
discussion
um if i may i think if we boil it down
again
what will this create is a
disintermediation
of commercial banks so right now i give
my bank
10 euros and they can issue 80 90
depends on how much the multiplier they
are allowed once cbdc goes into effect
that will end
as far as i see it or at least there is
nothing in place to allow commercial
banks to keep on issuing more money
right so
in a way you can say that commercial
banks are going to face
unfair competition from their own
regulator because they cannot do what
they can do nowadays so that is
we're going to go into a situation where
i think most of the smaller banks will
be cut out of a lot of the business that
they currently do
and probably some of the banking leaders
out there
i don't know jp in the in in the u.s so
gen in europe so on and so forth will
still have their share of the pie but
the small guys within the banking sector
will probably suffer the grant
any other comments guys
well the curious question right now back
back to the panelists is uh
i know would
would regulate us want to get in that
space you know of competing with their
their local financial systems the banks
or would they then issue um you know
cbdc's to the banks right like how it's
traditionally done right now central
bank prints money distributes it to the
bank and and charges a very low interest
rate and then the banks you know sort of
uh so banks can't print money by the way
yeah you know and so then it gets
distributed all right so i think the the
problem with the cbdc is that once the
central bank issues it you cannot do a
multiplier on it i cannot reissue more
currency i cannot lo you cannot give me
10 euros and i give 90 as a loan
because it is issued centrally so there
is a problem with the multiplier effect
when it comes to the commercial banks so
right now i haven't maybe there is a
solution out there but i have not heard
it you know as an economist out there or
maybe i haven't read enough about it but
that is a problem that no one has pro i
think addressed so far
interesting point
back to you sorry
[Laughter]
anybody else on that one
well
the interesting thing is uh
if cbdc's come into effect
then not only banks lose underst on the
idea that we've already seen and heard
here which is basically you don't you no
longer require deposit-based money but
also
if
there is proper access to this cbdc
ledger then anybody can be a bank right
that's the whole original idea of crypto
that be your own bank
and but this is very much dependent on
the implementation of the ledger and the
way it will be handled and i think this
will be this will differ from region to
region from country to country
but in practice nothing stops a tao from
being a very good like bank
like
issuing loans like very effectively
so in that sense there is a big wave of
disruption of banking in general
that's possible but i also worry that um
a lot of that energy will be hampered by
regulation because banks have a big seat
at the table and they will probably push
back against it pretty hard so we might
see we might actually see a model in
which you will not be able to access
your currency without a bank account
even though you actually don't need it
so that's the way i see it right now
essentially there is there is disruption
but also there is banks have a seat at
the table and it's going to be a long
fight to
bring a more
a more efficient system with less
intermediaries
okay so do you
see
uh central banks getting involved in
this space
because of recognition that that's the
way the world is going that the that
money is no longer going to be
paper-based it's going to be digital and
and they've got to go ahead even though
they maybe were reluctant to begin with
do you see them doing it because they
want to be involved do you see them
doing it because it's a defensive move
do you see them doing it because of the
the sort of the benefits they can see
or the flip side of that the drawbacks
if they don't and this sort of comes
back to the points you were making dave
what exactly are the benefits and the
drawbacks to the government if you focus
on that part why is a government why is
a central bank going to be wanting to
issue effectively and stable coins uh
okay slightly different definitions it's
a stable coin in that it is the country
currencies such as the dollar or river
instead of having a
a private stable coin that's pegged so
what what are the reasons that the
central banks are going to be wanting to
do this
so it's obviously it's better accounting
better control
creating probably it's
really depends on the particular
government creating new smart contracts
using all that technology stuff
unfortunately it really depends on
particular government and we needs and
we will because uh
in this century they uh
try to or could unnecessary freedom
financial freedom the more we live the
more kyc ml procedures we have
this thing you can we think you cannot
and it's more and more complicated more
and more uh
it's uh
there is there is a bright side of it
also you can do interconnection uh
international uh
payments you can you know let's say
uh we live in some country which not
really uh
we
which doesn't have its dollar and they
uh issue
their own cbdc and everyone in the world
with the mobile phone can use it
and that's a really benefit for its
country because it's expand the uh
their uh local currency like uh
expand the region they they can they can
print some money and everyone can use it
that's every government wants
with cbdc you can extend you can like
sell dollar
we don't need you we have we have this
we have this look at this and in every
mobile phone you can change one currency
to another that's a bright side but all
other things i agree with you
that's it's more control
yeah i i do find a problem with cbdc's
or central government if they adopt
stable coins because if we are operating
internationally and i'm a country and
i'm operating with another country and
we're exchanging money all we're
exchanging is really that
all i'm exchanging is the trust that you
will pay me in the future absolutely so
once you put a stable coin into effect
i'm not really relying on the country's
resources or how much
gold you have okay the gold standard has
been abandoned but let's say how much
reserves do you have or how much trust i
have in you but how much trust i have in
the stable coin so that relationship
will well i don't know even know how
that would work
yeah but but every bit
i guess we all find it as frustrating as
i do every time you read a newspaper it
talks about digital currency whether
that's a private crypto a stable coin
anything else it says that doesn't
really exist apart from a bunch of sort
of digital numbers etc etc but fiat
currencies don't exist apart from bits
of printed paper
and
when times get tough governments just
print money
uh at least with digital coins uh you
don't have that same sort of situation
so you could argue that that digital
coins are much much uh better for the
economy safer than than paper
well correct i mean when i'm when i'm
holding us dollars or if i'm holding us
dollars all i'm holding is the trust
that maybe the us government has a good
army behind it or maybe that they have
good oil reserves and this is
i'm not saying that this is the right
way to go or this is like an economic
way but this is the way we are used to
now so
is the world ready to move to a
a gold standard back to a gold standard
or before the glass-steagall act for the
for the for the banks as well where
things are done properly where you have
one
unit of measurement and you have to have
the
something to back it up you know i'm not
sure the world wants to go
back to to that standard because
most of the economies that we have right
now
most of them are inflated we are living
in a big bubble that's why the crypto
industry is where it is right now
so cbdc's will be inflated just the same
way
and what about exchange rates so
at the moment exchange rates
supply demand one currency against
another currency that's just going to be
the same with uh with cbdc's
well and an exchange rate is basically
how much money is in circulation and
not just that it's about what what the
financial markets decide
and it is still a demand and supply and
expectation
as well by by the traders so i do not
see much difference in the way
the effects markets work as a speculator
or an nx trader to be able to influence
the fx markets if cbds were involved
rather than than traditional currencies
the only difference is that if cbdc's
are in place a government can move much
quicker to reduce
or increase the money supply
pavel
yeah what i wanted to say is it just
came to my mind and i never really
thought about it but
once cbdc's become
something that's in effect and if there
really are blockchains that are really
open then
the governments of the world are going
to start having the problems that
decentralized blockchains have right now
which is bridging and interoperability
like what if i exchange
the indonesian currency here for serbian
currency where i am like does this mean
that i actually burn
tokens here and print them somewhere
else how will this work who will manage
these bridges will this be like an
international cooperation or will it
just be a
probably a big mess
so this is something that we are about
to discover
but
to just very quickly add on i think that
cptcs are
first and foremost were conceived as a
reactionary
type
as a reaction to essentially the crypto
market i think there was this idea that
you will just have
all of these stable coins and people
will use them because they just believe
that they work even though they aren't
really covered or people just sort of
believe they're covered and that
essentially lets you print money without
a license and this can potentially be
dangerous for the sovereignty of your
nation's money
and everything else is just a fight
essentially we're going to have the
biggest fight for financial privacy
in the history of the world in the next
10 years so we either we retain some
financial privacy or all of it will be
gone
this is the biggest danger in my opinion
of cbdc's because they can just be
designed as a solution to something that
seems like an urgent problem
and then it's it's like some of the
coronavirus measures like privacy was
never taken into account and that's what
i'm personally afraid of
that we will just have a system that
fully
accounts and fully tracks every
cent of every dollar that you ever own
well
i'd like to share some information i
like use cases in korea because uh the
korean people don't use cash anymore
like i can definitely tell you like i
haven't seen korean
cash
for like more than six months i haven't
even seen them i don't know where they
are
now people are just only only using that
payment system with a credit card that's
it probably 99 of the transactions
are digitally
made in korea already
and then the government actually
found out that all those big name
companies uh you know those credit card
companies and payment system companies
you're pointing out that they're
actually taking all the data
off of the people
and then uh you know people actually
don't worry about like cbdc and then
taking control like big brother thing
and stuff like that but
in reality those like credit card
companies and payment system companies
are taking all the data and they're
actually actually controlling the social
network
so like
in opposite like government
like have to do something about this
thing
so
in korea it's more like they have to do
it's not like they want to do or like
maybe there's benefit or something it's
more like that
their mission
to accomplish
i i think you're probably right in that
most central banks see this is a space
they've got to be doing something in
rather than they want to be doing
something in but nevertheless there are
a load of
uh good opportunities if if they're
going to get involved and play but
you talked about cash and and
how little that is used nowadays what we
found around the world for the last
couple of years of lockdowns and and
everything else
was it telescoped many many things it
telescopes the use of
uh zoom
or video conferencing it telescopes the
use of cashless payments even the shops
that were open in the uk
had signed up saying not accepting cash
because it was dirty everybody was
touching it
so it's telescoped even the people that
didn't particularly want to be moving
over to to paying uh with credit card or
or something simple not even talking
about about cryptos or stable coins but
it sort of moved that whole space
and i think the
uh
the whole environment has just got
quicker and quicker
and so
as the the private sector moves ever
more quickly the government sector is
now sort of rushing along to try and
play catch-up
so
i guess
well maybe it's a question
better left towards the end but i'm
going to ask it now anyway so
are we seeing cbdc's
as as a type of stablecoin
or are you seeing it as something quite
separate
so we we touched upon what a private
stablecoin is it's it's tethered to
dollar or euro
and whilst this uh
cbdc's won't fluctuate in the way that
maybe bitcoin or ethereum does
nevertheless uh it's not quite the same
so how are you guys viewing it do you
see them as as being very much in the
same space or or actually operating
their own little space
well well if i made i'm just
drawing on on
my experience in from malaysia
you know and
they they look at it as a
as a more efficient way for
international settlements so which is
why they are they are moving towards uh
no
they've not really
adopted it yet but they've done a poc um
to then say that no
the the the
international settlements time you know
if you if you use cbdc and you settle
within other countries it's much more
efficient and it's much more faster
right from from that perspective i think
note that there is a use case
and project dunbar by the way is
launched by you know bank for
international settlements and four
countries were involved in in that no
exploring no multinational multi-cbdc
kind of a settlement so malaysia
singapore australia and south africa
were part of that uh that consortium and
and they recently just concluded and
they found note that the the use case is
pretty real and you can save a lot of
time and money by the way so so the
so back to your previous question right
why would banks or central banks or
monetary
authorities would like a dog bit right
you know
looking at that level but no if you then
telescope it back down to a uh
a retail level then then yeah the the
debate i think is out there right you
know do you want to have a cbdc rupiah
or you want to have a cbdc ringgit or
you would rather hold
a usdt or usdc right you know
i'm i'm not sure
maybe
alexander or kim
obviously there is a benefit what we're
saying with regards to settlement
because when i send you a transfer from
walter to the uk
normal transfers are t plus two by the
time the the settlements are are in
place you can receive it but technically
it's not settled so there's always two
days by the time money starts when i
send it from me to you so there's a very
specific use case and answering your
very specific questions
um if of stable coins versus the cbdc
it's it's a bit of a tricky question
because you're talking about issuing a
national currency but being stable
stable against what
so we're not issuing dollars on like on
on the blockchain and pegging it to
something else so the only reason the
only value
why we would
call
scbdc a stablecoin is if we go back to
what we originally discussed if we are
willing to go back to pegging
and the value of our leader our value of
our dollar or sterling to something
which have actually uh value let's say
for example going back to the to the
gold standard this we can then say that
fiat went back to being stable otherwise
our currencies right now are not stable
fiat is not stable
we we adore too much fiat by saying we
packed usdt to the dollar now it's
stable
if we go back to fiat i say we need to
pick fiat
to something that is tangible
and
that is the only way
i will
bend over backwards and say
fiat is stable if we are willing to peg
it to something of value otherwise we're
gonna go to the same loop that we've
been go going over the last five ten
fifteen years
going printing money
and then trying to to uh
to
retract it further down the line don't
get me wrong we
enjoy when governments print money when
there is recessions because we make
money you know i've been trading for 17
years and when there's panic in the
markets we love it
but that shouldn't be the way things are
done so that's why i would suggest if
we're going to call sabdc a stablecoin
we go back to pegging it to a unit of
value not to the government's trust yeah
and we all know that's never going to
happen so not going to happen taboo
well what i wanted to say is i believe
that speaking from like a web 3
perspective i think webtree is going to
start eating cbdc it's not in a sense
that it's going to displace them and
it's never going to displace cbdc money
because people
are used to think about pricing things
and money
and say usd or a major currency or in
their local currency so in a lot of ways
you you need
something that that looks like your
local money to be able to use different
financial applications but i can see
this as a i can see cptc is slowly
displacing directly
backed uh stable coins such as tether
because you don't you don't really need
to
trust tether if you have the ultimate
authority of your money that is
issuing money
back stable coins will endure in
situations where they are incentivized
for example uh binance might incentivize
people to hold busd for their own
reasons and people will hold hold busd
because they trust finance and because
they are literally being paid to do so
however i think that
like the entire d5 space is hungry for
like real world assets
real world assets
such as money can come in into these
smart contract-based systems and they
can help stabilize and and and remove
pressure and help grow the overall d5
market
so i am pretty sure that there are
already talks by big dows such as maker
dow for example to onboard like bank
loans
collateralize them into like nfts and
put them by them and put them in their
in their treasuries so this is just
removes the intermediary and says well
we got a bunch of cash just in case of
an emergency if there's some kind of
liquidation crunch if the price of the
token suddenly drops or if we just need
cash on hand to buy something you know
because
we have to sell
say eth or ever tokens but we don't need
to do that and disrupt the market when
we have literal cash on hand we can go
buy something as a doubt
so i think in that sense that cbdc is if
implemented
the way i believe should be interpreted
which is like open and integrated
worldwide
they will become a seamless part of web3
and i think that's the best possible
outcome because then we have all these
emergent situations all these emergent
plays all these new startups and
thousands and things that can be
experimented upon
so in a nutshell
backed
this is this entire
uh movement
is expected by in my opinion to uh
displace these directly backed tokens
but they will still kind of live around
if incentivized and web3 will definitely
eat a lot of the cbdc's and put it into
like existing blockchains
okay and moving on if we can because i'm
very mindful of time moving on a bit
more away from the theoretical and
looking more at the technical so what
about the actual implementing uh cbdc's
on blockchain
in both
a developed financial market and in more
of a frontier or emerging
financial market are the differences
between the two and how would you go
about it and how easy or how difficult
it is talk us through that a little bit
maybe papal that's that's probably
one for you to start with okay yeah
yeah this is quite a different angle but
essentially uh the issue here is scale
so a cbdc cannot be built on a on a
blockchain that has the same kind of
consensus rules and is built to
be massively redundant and massively
distributed mostly because
theoretically the number of transactions
you can have on a cbdc network can be
in the millions per second
so
i think uh that cpcs as they scale will
probably use similar approaches that
have been uh sort of researched by
traditionally centralized blockchains
which is potentially modularity
either that or we will have like a very
small set of authorities that
run big huge data centers like visa does
and they will process an enormous number
of transactions since this is
essentially
uh this is essentially a system that
looks like a blockchain
and has interfaces like a blockchain but
is controlled by one entity by one
government then it can be basically run
on a server farm or a bunch of server
farms so in the end if
if countries decide to distribute this
network to citizens or private entities
then it will have to be modular in scope
like it will have to settle through
multiple layers
if and this is more likely in the
beginning it still stays as a tightly
controlled network
it will probably be run on a bunch of
government data centers and then it will
not really have the same kind of scaling
issues that blockchains have nowadays
because it is essentially just a big
payment settlement network like banks
use today
any other thoughts on that one
the the difference between cbdc's and uh
stable coins is really easy one is
centralized as hell so
we we should uh
we should understand that that is not
not one government uh
ever
as i know plan to distribute their
fiscal power
between
people entities so i tell you how it
will be let's say united states uh
start using cbdc's uh when the the
use cases will be like uh okay we don't
want oil companies to you know develop
new
places to
[Music]
gather oil
climate change all that stuff
democrats tell that we want to present
them and if like
now they
have to you know
talk to every bank you shouldn't have
get the you shouldn't help help them get
funded you shouldn't give them money
with cbdc's they just press a button and
you can't fund you let's say oil call
whatever and if you know how the
politics work
how the elections work it could be a
really terrific
that's my opinion on that
i usually like to boil down things very
simply as you're you're getting the gist
so all we're talking about really is um
centralized electronic money
with a ledger that that that's that's
all we're talking about cbdc
so
it has needs to have two functions one
this will operate in a very highly
regulated environment
with with certain abilities to be able
to change money in circulation so right
now fiat are based
on government intervention if we need to
intervene there's always something
available so we need to leave that
intervention in place otherwise there's
not going to be any uptake by any
governments
and second if we're going to design say
for example ever to be a cbdc to to be a
chain the transat cbdc
we need to also keep in mind once we
design it around say for example let's
say the maltese or the british
government that once we designed it for
this government it is interoperable with
other chains out there so those two
things might not go hand in hand or when
you program one you might not think of
the other but if you don't think of both
at the same time then you're going to
run into problems later down the line
and personally
i think that
this we're not going to live in a world
where
everyone is going to go to the to around
table and we're going to develop cbdc's
that are interoperable but
we're going to get specific regions
because of the geopolitical scenario
that adopt their cbdc for example
russia china and the cis region will
develop their own they come back
together because they do not speak maybe
to the western countries and we're going
to get a hodgepodge
of cbdc's that later down the line we're
going to have a problem to make
interoperable between themselves and
obviously i might be wrong but this is
my view of the world
well i think back back to dave and paul
bell's earlier point right
cbdc is all about trust right and i
think you know and on on your point how
do you implement it properly
um
i think it's got a lot to do with know
the the oracles the data that you
integrate right because ultimately no
currency is
is decided you know on on interest rates
on on
on inflation and economies makes those
kind of complicated you know so-called
calculations right now to to estimate uh
how much you know a currency is worth
and then how do you combat against
inflation or deflation and all these
other things right so if implemented
properly and i think cbdc could be
much more efficient you know because
it's algorithm mines and also all the
formulas are put in place properly but
you know like you say do you have you
know the necessary data or oracles uh to
support not that
that that algorithm to to again back to
your point make it stable right so what
is the definition of stable by the way
right so i think though
with with those combination you know and
then if implemented properly uh it could
be you know it could be one of those uh
better cases and i don't think the
difference is between a developed
country versus a non-developed country i
think it's then it's a battle of
standards
which standards or which protocols you
know it's going to be the the most
widely adopted protocol and i think the
one step that broker is being you know
taken by the governments and then i
think the interoperability then will
will be easier to solve because
everybody's using similar protocols and
and so you have similar level of trust
if i know that you are using a certain
formula to compute
right the the stability right of your
currency you know versus mine no if
you're using different protocols or
different standards or ways to to to
stabilize our currencies then
then that's where the trust is is not
there anymore right yeah and then i
think back to that question right i
think so so i guess that whole question
of
interoperability and cooperation is is
core
uh
and you have to ask yourself what are
the chances of that happening
but globally i mean it's it's probably
not is it
well again back to project dunbar right
now so so it's four countries coming
together to test it out exactly but but
four countries not
270 or 300 and yeah i mean whatever
that i think we're going to have a
hodgepodge of different countries or
different regions coming together but i
think it's a pipe dream and it's going
to remain as a pipeline for quite a long
time yes unfortunately we see now in the
world is de globalization so
supply chains destructions everybody
fights each other
uh
dollar become a little bit weaker a
little bit weaker every year as you say
now they should rely on the currency
that will be backed by real commodities
like
metal
oil gold something and uh probably that
will be the trend for next 10 20 years
so we
probably can't see the
whole friendship cbdc for all countries
unfortunately yeah
okay so just to wrap up then um
i guess the the bottom line question is
are cbdc's
a good thing or a bad thing should we
just work along the line again as this
is the last very brief uh
brief brief comments and your thoughts
on everything that we've discussed today
pablo let's start with you and work back
in this direction again
i think the cbdc's will simply be a
thing okay it's like
as oppenheimer said you you have the key
and it opens the gaze to heaven and the
gates to hell and we definitely have the
technology to build it
and it can be used to
bring some very interesting financial
innovation it can be like the gateway to
ubi in certain countries it can also be
a nightmare for privacy it can be used
to exclude political
the opinionated persons from the
financial system and from the monetary
system which is the level above
so
the fight is on us
to try and as as a worldwide society to
try and make this into something that is
that is
good and accessible for everyone and
interoperable so that's the only thing
that that i think we can say that the
fight is on us
okay yeah i do
by the way yeah you know uh it's
inevitable right so
you can't resist it no then it's it's up
to us to make sure that it's being
ushered or being pushed down the right
path right instead of just letting go
well and
and governments adopting subpass
standards you know into deploying their
cv dc's right so i think
it's everybody's so-called
effort and everybody is a responsibility
to ensure that you know we will hold our
governments accountable um you know when
they're deploying these sort of
technologies right and not you know get
so-called uh swayed not by personal
interest to then adopt a particular
technology because i'm friends with them
or whatever right
yeah your thoughts sure oh yeah
on the same page of course uh we don't
know what's gonna happen
all i do is i try my best to
make it better
that's all i can say and then these guys
covered pretty much everything so uh
i'll i'll define it as a one-liner i
think it's a pandora's box with great
possibilities
okay i uh wrap it up like this way uh i
think the cbd6 is unfortunately another
nail to a coffin of free markets
and uh certainly a threat to united
states dollars so it's
like half half
okay and and on that note i guess thank
you very much guys a very interesting
discussion i hope everybody out there
found it interesting also
