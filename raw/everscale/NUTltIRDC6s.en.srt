00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,270

hello

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,280
hello
 

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,630
hello
everyone let me i

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:06,640
everyone let me i
 

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,509
everyone let me i
i can share my screen just to show the

6
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:11,519

 

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,910

um what we're going to talk about

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:14,920
um what we're going to talk about
 

9
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,470
um what we're going to talk about
today

10
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:18,480

 

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,230

so it will be like

12
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,240

 

13
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:36,229

like that

14
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:36,239

 

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,590

where is it here you go so

16
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
where is it here you go so
 

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,150
where is it here you go so
we're in the flex exchange

18
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
we're in the flex exchange
 

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,869
we're in the flex exchange
repository we have a nice mascot by the

20
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
repository we have a nice mascot by the
 

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:47,990
repository we have a nice mascot by the
way now

22
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
way now
 

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,110
way now
you see that it's called flex it's a dog

24
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
you see that it's called flex it's a dog
 

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,349
you see that it's called flex it's a dog
um so we have

26
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
um so we have
 

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,950
um so we have
flex contracts and we have tip three

28
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:02,960
flex contracts and we have tip three
 

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,789
flex contracts and we have tip three
that we're going to cover today so

30
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
that we're going to cover today so
 

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,190
that we're going to cover today so
quickly again that will be combined with

32
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200
quickly again that will be combined with
 

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,950
quickly again that will be combined with
the demo which we did in the community

34
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960
the demo which we did in the community
 

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,670
the demo which we did in the community
stream

36
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:11,680
stream
 

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,230
stream
with the interface so the user

38
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
with the interface so the user
 

39
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,310
with the interface so the user
experience has already been covered

40
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
experience has already been covered
 

41
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,789
experience has already been covered
now we are just going to cover the code

42
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
now we are just going to cover the code
 

43
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,830
now we are just going to cover the code
and um

44
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:23,840
and um
 

45
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,510
and um
well that's it so in terms of the

46
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
well that's it so in terms of the
 

47
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,630
well that's it so in terms of the
architecture

48
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640

 

49
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,630

it's um it's also been covered a little

50
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
it's um it's also been covered a little
 

51
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,069
it's um it's also been covered a little
bit on the community stream so just

52
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
bit on the community stream so just
 

53
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,749
bit on the community stream so just
briefly tell you that it's a completely

54
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
briefly tell you that it's a completely
 

55
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,030
briefly tell you that it's a completely
distributed

56
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
distributed
 

57
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,310
distributed
order book exchange decentralized and

00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
which means that any user can create a
 

63
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,230
which means that any user can create a

64
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
pair
 

65
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,310
pair
and it's a special separate contract

66
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
and it's a special separate contract
 

67
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,910
and it's a special separate contract
which is a pair route

68
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
which is a pair route
 

69
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,749
which is a pair route
that will govern all the prices inside

70
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
that will govern all the prices inside
 

71
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,190
that will govern all the prices inside
this pair and trades

72
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
this pair and trades
 

73
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,469
this pair and trades
and then if you want to trade you should

74
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
and then if you want to trade you should
 

75
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,590
and then if you want to trade you should
create a price on which

76
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,600
create a price on which
 

77
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,069
create a price on which
an order you want to trade depends on

78
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
an order you want to trade depends on
 

79
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,350
an order you want to trade depends on

what you want to do
currently it supports an exchange

82
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
currently it supports an exchange
 

83
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,430
currently it supports an exchange

special interfaces that andrew will
cover

94
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
cover
 

95
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,790

96
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
and what you create a a price
 

97
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,070
and what you create a a price
for the payer and because this price

98
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080
for the payer and because this price
 

99
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,430

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440
contract has uh
 

101
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,630

00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
has a same code it can be then
 

103
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,110
has a same code it can be then
searched uh very quickly by hash of the

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,120
searched uh very quickly by hash of the
 

105
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,470
searched uh very quickly by hash of the

contract
 

107
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,880

and so the whole price

108
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:38,890

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,949
in the database
and any user can actually calculate

116
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
and any user can actually calculate
 

117
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,710
and any user can actually calculate
the price account

118
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
the price account
 

119
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,150
the price account
by just uh you know by just just uh

120
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
by just uh you know by just just uh
 

121
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,830

with the taking the certificate and um

122
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
with the taking the certificate and um
 

123
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,390
with the taking the certificate and um
smart contract and then in of the

124
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
smart contract and then in of the
 

125
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,190
smart contract and then in of the
exchange

126
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
exchange
 

127
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,110
exchange
and then adding the like the price

128
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
and then adding the like the price
 

129
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,470
and then adding the like the price
in the pair so uh andrew will explain

130
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
in the pair so uh andrew will explain
 

131
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,430
in the pair so uh andrew will explain
that

132
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
that
 

133
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,110
that
uh in within the code how it done

134
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
uh in within the code how it done
 

135
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,949
uh in within the code how it done
and so if the if the contract already

136
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
and so if the if the contract already
 

137
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,470
and so if the if the contract already
exists then you just

138
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
exists then you just
 

139
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,670
exists then you just
then you just send their uh tokens

140
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
then you just send their uh tokens
 

141
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,270
then you just send their uh tokens
whatever it is and uh the trade will be

142
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
whatever it is and uh the trade will be
 

143
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,149
whatever it is and uh the trade will be
executed

144
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:24,159
executed
 

145
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,070
executed
immediately if there is a counterparty

146
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
immediately if there is a counterparty
 

147
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,990
immediately if there is a counterparty
because this obviously there is no need

148
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
because this obviously there is no need
 

149
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,030
because this obviously there is no need
for much

150
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
for much
 

151
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,390
for much
because the matching has already been

152
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
because the matching has already been
 

153
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,270
because the matching has already been
done you're sending it to the

154
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
done you're sending it to the
 

155
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,630
done you're sending it to the
to the price right yeah so

156
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
to the price right yeah so
 

157
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,830
to the price right yeah so
so um it's distributed because the part

158
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
so um it's distributed because the part
 

159
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,430
so um it's distributed because the part
of the logic is sitting in

160
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
of the logic is sitting in
 

161
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,750
of the logic is sitting in
on the user side part of the logic in a

162
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
on the user side part of the logic in a
 

163
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,589
on the user side part of the logic in a
in a very distributed fashion

164
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
in a very distributed fashion
 

165
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,270
in a very distributed fashion
sitting on chain so i stopped

166
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
sitting on chain so i stopped
 

167
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,550
sitting on chain so i stopped
sharing my screen and

168
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
sharing my screen and
 

169
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,670
sharing my screen and
you know let's go to the

170
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
you know let's go to the
 

171
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,070
you know let's go to the
to the code so who starts andrew i think

172
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
to the code so who starts andrew i think
 

173
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,110
to the code so who starts andrew i think
you should start okay

174
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
you should start okay
 

175
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,070
you should start okay

621
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,350
arguments
and let's talk about these arguments for

622
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
and let's talk about these arguments for
 

623
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,310
and let's talk about these arguments for
a second

624

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,230
later but uh okay so so
in order to count messages so i can send

1062
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:54,240
in order to count messages so i can send
 

1063
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,149
in order to count messages so i can send
an external message to my t3 wallet

1064
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:56,159
an external message to my t3 wallet
 

1065
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,590
an external message to my t3 wallet
right

1066
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:57,600
right
 

1067
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,630
right
which i currently know because

1068
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
which i currently know because
 

1069
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,830
which i currently know because
uh scripture wallet is limited

1070
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:03,840
uh scripture wallet is limited
 

1071
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,590
uh scripture wallet is limited
and because of uh

1072
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:07,600
and because of uh
 

1073
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,190
and because of uh
size size so so that's one of the

1074
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,200
size size so so that's one of the
 

1075
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,110
size size so so that's one of the
modifications that we did

1076
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,120
modifications that we did
 

1077
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,830
modifications that we did
is eliminated the external all right

1078
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:15,840
is eliminated the external all right
 

1079
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,789
is eliminated the external all right
because we wanted

1080
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:16,799
because we wanted
 

1081
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,830
because we wanted
and we will explain later why

1082
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:19,840
and we will explain later why
 

1083
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,789
and we will explain later why
it is important so the external message

1084
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:22,799
it is important so the external message
 

1085
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:23,110
it is important so the external message
is

1086
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,120
is
 

1087
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,350
is
is eliminate external methods eliminated

1088
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:25,360
is eliminate external methods eliminated
 

1089
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,269
is eliminate external methods eliminated
interface and now so you need to send an

1090
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:27,279

so so the so then the tip three wallet

1118
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,080
so so the so then the tip three wallet
 

1119
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,830
so so the so then the tip three wallet
sends the message to

1120
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:05,840
sends the message to
 

1121
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,750
sends the message to
this message to the to the price

1122
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:07,760
this message to the to the price
 

1123
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,350

contract right
 

1125
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,870
contract right
and then and that's how the order is

1126
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:12,880
and then and that's how the order is
 

1127
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,549
and then and that's how the order is
uh placed yes

1128

this is um so
 

1131
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,269
this is um so
let's say in order can i just do

1132
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:23,279
let's say in order can i just do
 

1133

okay this is uh orders

1256
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:11,840
okay this is uh orders
 

1257
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,950
okay this is uh orders
for sales and by okay i think this is

1258
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:14,960
for sales and by okay i think this is
 

1259
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,590
for sales and by okay i think this is
the only

1260
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:15,600
the only
 

1261
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,149
the only
this is the only time where we actually

1262
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:18,159
this is the only time where we actually
 

1263
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,029
this is the only time where we actually
have a list

1264
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:19,039
have a list
 

1265
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,070
have a list
of something right because that's

1266
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,080
of something right because that's
 

1267
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,549
of something right because that's
the orders in the orders will the list

1268
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:24,559
the orders in the orders will the list
 

1269
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,389
the orders in the orders will the list
of orders will always be on one side

1270
00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:28,399
of orders will always be on one side
 

1271
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,310
of orders will always be on one side
because if if the order comes to the

1272
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:30,320
because if if the order comes to the
 

1273
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,909
because if if the order comes to the
other side it will be immediately

1274
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:31,919
other side it will be immediately
 

1275
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,669
other side it will be immediately
executed against the order on the other

1276
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:33,679
executed against the order on the other
 

1277
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:34,230
executed against the order on the other
side

1278
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:34,240
side
 

1279
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,350
side
so well that's right maybe not

1280
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:37,360
so well that's right maybe not
 

1281
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,430
so well that's right maybe not
true in some situations yeah some

1282
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:39,440
true in some situations yeah some
 

1283
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,110
true in some situations yeah some
situations but we will cover them later

1284
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,120
situations but we will cover them later
 

1285
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,430
situations but we will cover them later
but

1286
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:41,440
but
 

1287
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,149
but
in general if you don't have any

1288
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:44,159
in general if you don't have any
 

1289
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:44,870
in general if you don't have any
conditions

1290
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:44,880
conditions
 

1291
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,830
conditions
on the orders let's say we because right

1292
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:47,840
on the orders let's say we because right
 

1293
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,750
on the orders let's say we because right
now in this implementation

1294
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:49,760
now in this implementation
 

1295
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,110
now in this implementation
we don't have any conditions yet right

1296
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,120
we don't have any conditions yet right
 

1297
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,990
we don't have any conditions yet right
well we don't have any condition but we

1298
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,000
well we don't have any condition but we
 

1299
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,549
well we don't have any condition but we
may

1300
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:56,559
may
 

1301
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,750
may
fit deals amount limit

1302
00:32:59,750 --> 00:32:59,760
fit deals amount limit
 

1303
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,789
fit deals amount limit
in one message and

1304
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:02,799
in one message and
 

1305
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,830
in one message and
for example then then

1306
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:05,840
for example then then
 

1307
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,909
for example then then
while next message will be processed

1308
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:07,919
while next message will be processed
 

1309
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:08,870
while next message will be processed
until next

1310
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:08,880
until next
 

1311
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,590
until next
or some next messages will be processed

1312
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:11,600
or some next messages will be processed
 

1313
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,310
or some next messages will be processed
the

1314
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:12,320
the
 

1315
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,630
the
for for this time in both

1316
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:16,640
for for this time in both
 

1317
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,630
for for this time in both
in sales and in bias there will be some

1318
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:20,640
in sales and in bias there will be some
 

1319
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,070
in sales and in bias there will be some
orders from both sides temporarily of

1320
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,080
orders from both sides temporarily of
 

1321
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,269
orders from both sides temporarily of
course

1322
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:25,279
course
 

1323
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,310
course
just because of uh deals limit

1324
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,320
just because of uh deals limit
 

1325
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,110
just because of uh deals limit
so this limit is is is already a

1326
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:31,120
so this limit is is is already a
 

1327
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,310
so this limit is is is already a
condition

1328
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:32,320
condition
 

1329
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,470
condition
but we can think about other conditions

1330
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:34,480
but we can think about other conditions
 

1331
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,669
but we can think about other conditions
which we may add

1332
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:35,679
which we may add
 

1333
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,389
which we may add
in the future with some other some

1334
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:38,399
in the future with some other some
 

1335
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,190
in the future with some other some
limits

1336
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,200
limits
 

1337
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,190
limits
uh and some some trading strategies

1338
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,200
uh and some some trading strategies
 

1339
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,370
uh and some some trading strategies
like for example i don't know um

1340
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:46,380
like for example i don't know um
 

1341
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,470
like for example i don't know um

it will not be executed or something

1348
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:54,880
it will not be executed or something
 

1349
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,389
it will not be executed or something
like that

1350

1351
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,029

all right

1352
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:03,039

 

1353
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:13,349

okay what else do we need to cover here

1354
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:13,359

 

1355
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,550

well we have some improvements since

1356
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:16,560
well we have some improvements since
 

1357
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,750
well we have some improvements since
reveals

1358
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:19,760

 

1359
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,669

see since previous talk

1360
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:23,679

 

1361
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,950

improvement in uh cancel cancel cell

1362
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:26,960
improvement in uh cancel cancel cell
 

1363
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,270
improvement in uh cancel cancel cell
cancel by

so this one is not in public so this one

1366
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:32,399
so this one is not in public so this one
 

1367
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,109
so this one is not in public so this one
we're still working on it's not in the

1368
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:35,119
we're still working on it's not in the
 

1369
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,710
we're still working on it's not in the
contest so the jury

1370
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:36,720
contest so the jury
 

1371
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,669
contest so the jury
if you watch this you should not take

1372
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:39,679
if you watch this you should not take
 

1373
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,589
if you watch this you should not take
that into consideration because these

1374
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:41,599
that into consideration because these
 

1375
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,389
that into consideration because these
are added

1376
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:42,399
are added
 

1377
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,510
are added
just now um and

1378
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:45,520
just now um and
 

1379
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,990
just now um and
they relate to the because the idea is

1380
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,000
they relate to the because the idea is
 

1381
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,909
they relate to the because the idea is
that the contract

1382
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:49,919
that the contract
 

1383
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:52,629
that the contract
um under certain condition actually when

1384
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:52,639
um under certain condition actually when
 

1385
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,030
um under certain condition actually when
the

1386
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,040
the

andrew please explain how it works
well exactly just when both

1396
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:05,599

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,270
the contact will send all
the remaining native fonts to stop

1402
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:17,280
the remaining native fonts to stop
 

1403
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,550
the remaining native fonts to stop
and destroy itself

1404
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:20,560
and destroy itself
 

1405
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,630
and destroy itself
in this mechanic that's it

1406
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:24,640
in this mechanic that's it
 

1407
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,430
in this mechanic that's it
yep and that was not we didn't we didn't

1408
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:27,440
yep and that was not we didn't we didn't

maybe you can explain why the size of
 

1417
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,790
maybe you can explain why the size of
the contract is so important

1418

the contract is so important
 

1419
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,310
the contract is so important
well to fit uh

price code in arguments so
 

1473
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,150
price code in arguments so
um because we need

1477
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,710

we need to deploy price contract with

1478
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:34,720
we need to deploy price contract with
 

1479
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,670
we need to deploy price contract with
the

1480
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:35,680
the
 

1481
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,430
the
tip three words called in arguments

tip three words called in arguments
 

1483
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,870
tip three words called in arguments
so we need to both code in uh deploy

1484
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:42,880
so we need to both code in uh deploy
 

1485

yes and we need to do that obviously
 

1489
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,589
yes and we need to do that obviously
because when tip3

1490
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:47,599
because when tip3

you know some message we need to really

1496
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,040
you know some message we need to really
 

1497
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,950
you know some message we need to really
be sure that this is really tip three

1498
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:54,960
be sure that this is really tip three
 

1499
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,990

talking
so we need to and the the i we're not

1502
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:58,640
so we need to and the the i we're not
 

1503
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,430
so we need to and the the i we're not
going to

1504
00:37:59,430 --> 00:37:59,440
going to
 

1505
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,150
going to
explain again how tip three works but

1506
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,160
explain again how tip three works but
 

1507
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,109
explain again how tip three works but
generally

1508
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:03,119
generally
 

1509
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,710
generally
you you know the contract has a code of

1510
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:04,720
you you know the contract has a code of
 

1511
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,310
you you know the contract has a code of
tip three

1512
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:06,320
tip three
 

1513
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,030
tip three
it tries to deploy it to the address and

1514
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,040
it tries to deploy it to the address and
 

1515
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,589
it tries to deploy it to the address and
and then

1516
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:09,599
and then
 

1517
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,349
and then
that's how it checks that that's this is

1518
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:11,359
that's how it checks that that's this is
 

1519
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,270
that's how it checks that that's this is
this the address that it got the message

1520
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:13,280
this the address that it got the message
 

1521
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,630
this the address that it got the message
from which means it's a

1522
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:14,640
from which means it's a
 

1523
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,750
from which means it's a
real tip three uh token contract

1524
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:17,760
real tip three uh token contract
 

1525
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,829
real tip three uh token contract
and uh uh in order to do that you need

1526
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:19,839
and uh uh in order to do that you need
 

1527
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,030
and uh uh in order to do that you need
to have a tip three

1528
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,040
to have a tip three
 

1529
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,230
to have a tip three
token bullet a code within within the

1530
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:24,240
token bullet a code within within the
 

1531
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,270
token bullet a code within within the

1532
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:25,280

1533
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,310
price contract
that's why and why actually one message

1534
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:28,320
that's why and why actually one message
 

1535
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,470
that's why and why actually one message
well it's because we want it's a flex

1536
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:30,480
well it's because we want it's a flex
 

1537
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,550
well it's because we want it's a flex
exchange right so it needs to work

1538
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:32,560
exchange right so it needs to work
 

1539
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,190
exchange right so it needs to work
really really fast in order to do that

1540
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:35,200
really really fast in order to do that
 

1541
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,910
really really fast in order to do that
we want

1542
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:35,920

and of course the limit orders and and

1590
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:52,240
and of course the limit orders and and
 

1591
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,430

all
kind of advanced uh strategies that we

1594
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:56,400
kind of advanced uh strategies that we
 

1595
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,990
kind of advanced uh strategies that we
actually want to add

1596
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:58,000
actually want to add
 

1597
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,550
actually want to add
well we all we are we need to add that

1598
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:00,560
well we all we are we need to add that
 

1599
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,030
well we all we are we need to add that
all

1600
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,040

contractor also need the step three

1604
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:04,480
contractor also need the step three

so it's really really place like storage

1608
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:08,839
so it's really really place like storage
 

1609
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,309
so it's really really place like storage

1614
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:15,040

1615
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,230

to make some orders manipulations
 

1621
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,390
to make some orders manipulations
for example for stops and such and

1622
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:26,400
for example for stops and such and
 

1623
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,589
for example for stops and such and
to to not keep this logic in

1624
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:29,599
to to not keep this logic in
 

1625
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,829
to to not keep this logic in
price contract itself yeah no of course

1626
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:31,839
price contract itself yeah no of course
 

1627
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,309
price contract itself yeah no of course
but i'm talking about like

1628
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:34,319
but i'm talking about like
 

1629
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,270
but i'm talking about like
some some functions that are necessary

1630
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:37,280
some some functions that are necessary
 

1631
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,990
some some functions that are necessary
to implement

1632
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,000
to implement
 

1633
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,990
to implement
this kind of logic on on the client side

1634
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,000
this kind of logic on on the client side
 

1635
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,589
this kind of logic on on the client side
of course most of the

1636
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:41,599
of course most of the
 

1637
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,349
of course most of the
most of the trading strategies should be

1638
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:43,359
most of the trading strategies should be
 

1639
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,030
most of the trading strategies should be
implemented on the client side

1640
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,040
implemented on the client side
 

1641
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,150
implemented on the client side
and that's where all this um you know

1642
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
and that's where all this um you know
 

1643
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,109
and that's where all this um you know
search by hash

1644
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:49,119
search by hash
 

1645
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,309
search by hash
and other possibilities that um

1646
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:52,319
and other possibilities that um
 

1647
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,030
and other possibilities that um
this architecture provides can be really

1648
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,040
this architecture provides can be really
 

1649
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,670
this architecture provides can be really
kind of

1650
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:55,680
kind of
 

1651
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,510
kind of
um exploited

1652
00:40:59,510 --> 00:40:59,520
um exploited
 

1653
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,550
um exploited
but in order to do these strategies

1654
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:02,560
but in order to do these strategies
 

1655
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,710
but in order to do these strategies
you need some basic logic within price

1656
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:04,720
you need some basic logic within price
 

1657
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,150
you need some basic logic within price
contract so that's

1658
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,160
contract so that's
 

1659
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,069
contract so that's
that's why it is important sure

1660
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:10,079
that's why it is important sure
 

1661
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,630
that's why it is important sure
and also functionality missed in

1662
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:14,640
and also functionality missed in
 

1663
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,670
and also functionality missed in
previous implementation is

1664
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:17,680
previous implementation is
 

1665
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,710
previous implementation is
order expiring check

1666
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:20,720
order expiring check
 

1667
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,390
order expiring check
we now have order expire check

1668
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:26,400

 

1669
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,150

if if some con if some order is expired

1670
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,160
if if some con if some order is expired
 

1671
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,150
if if some con if some order is expired
we don't access it

1672
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,160
we don't access it
 

1673
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,750
we don't access it
we send in a notification

1674
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:37,760
we send in a notification

1681
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,630

uh something which is missing uh like

1682
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:56,640
uh something which is missing uh like
 

1683
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,470
uh something which is missing uh like
can you talk about commissions in

1684
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:58,480
can you talk about commissions in
 

1685
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,870
can you talk about commissions in
general how do we see commissions and uh

1686
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:02,880
general how do we see commissions and uh
 

1687
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,790
general how do we see commissions and uh
would we change anything

1688
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:06,800

 

1689
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,390

in some way such configuration
 

1707
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,510
in some way such configuration
must be updated so basically you update

1708
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:41,520
must be updated so basically you update
 

1709
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,069
must be updated so basically you update
the root

1710
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:42,079
the root
 

1711
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,349
the root
you update basically you need to

1712
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:43,359
you update basically you need to
 

1713
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,270
you update basically you need to
redeploy the the whole exchange

1714
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:45,280
redeploy the the whole exchange
 

1715
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,829
redeploy the the whole exchange
to change it right apparently yes done

1716
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:47,839
to change it right apparently yes done
 

1717
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,670
to change it right apparently yes done
yes sir

1718
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:49,680
yes sir
 

1719
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,790
yes sir
yeah um and that's that's a limitation

1720
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:52,800
yeah um and that's that's a limitation
 

1721
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,470
yeah um and that's that's a limitation
but that's also a beauty

1722
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:54,480
but that's also a beauty
 

1723
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,030
but that's also a beauty
and remember anyone it's because it's

1724
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,040
and remember anyone it's because it's
 

1725
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,990
and remember anyone it's because it's
completely decentralized

1726

contract and here we go

1736
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:07,040
contract and here we go
 

1737
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,309
contract and here we go
um so you you can change parameters and

1738
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:10,319
um so you you can change parameters and
 

1739
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,589
um so you you can change parameters and
everyone can see that and

1740
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:11,599
everyone can see that and
 

1741
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,589
everyone can see that and
you cannot change parameters backwards

1742
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:13,599
you cannot change parameters backwards
 

1743
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,510
you cannot change parameters backwards
so meaning you cannot change commissions

1744
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:15,520
so meaning you cannot change commissions
 

1745
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,150
so meaning you cannot change commissions
for example

1746
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:16,160
for example
 

1747
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,190
for example
once they once the exchange is deployed

00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:19,200
once they once the exchange is deployed
 

1749
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,470
once they once the exchange is deployed
then that's it

power points
 

1841
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,270
power points
for further improvements so this is

1842
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:11,280
for further improvements so this is
 

1843
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,910
for further improvements so this is
sell price called currently implemented

and we need

1846
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:14,720
and we need
 

1847
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,710
and we need
exchange price code for two addresses

1848
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:18,720

to as assault into code price code

1854
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:30,880
to as assault into code price code
 

1855
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,510
to as assault into code price code
and i think price code will be different

1856
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:33,520
and i think price code will be different
 

1857
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,150
and i think price code will be different
not

1858
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,160
not
 

1859
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,870
not
not this because we need specific logic

1860
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:38,880
not this because we need specific logic
 

1861
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,230
not this because we need specific logic
and i mean they may have some common

1862
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:42,240
and i mean they may have some common
 

1863
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,349
and i mean they may have some common
libraries and such

1864
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:43,359
libraries and such
 

1865
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,550
libraries and such
but as a tvc file

1866
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:46,560
but as a tvc file
 

1867
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,270
but as a tvc file
it will be compiled as a different

00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:49,280
it will be compiled as a different
 

1869
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,150
it will be compiled as a different

1871
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,829
contract
of course yeah but that's a work in

1872
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:51,839
of course yeah but that's a work in
 

1873
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,990
of course yeah but that's a work in
progress so we are planning to add that

1874
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:54,000
progress so we are planning to add that
 

1875
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,109
progress so we are planning to add that
in the future

1876
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:55,119
in the future
 

1877
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,270
in the future
this possibility but even now if it's

1878
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:57,280
this possibility but even now if it's
 

1879
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,309
this possibility but even now if it's
good like

1880
00:45:58,309 --> 00:45:58,319
good like
 

1881
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,150
good like
you know any anyway a lot of exchanges

1882
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:00,160
you know any anyway a lot of exchanges
 

1883
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,510
you know any anyway a lot of exchanges
we just we just give you the

1884
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:01,520
we just we just give you the

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,430
we just we just give you the
pair one pair against or pairs against

1886
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:05,440

00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:12,720
so that's that's one one vector of
 

1893
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,030
so that's that's one one vector of
of the future work well actually about

1894
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,040
of the future work well actually about
 

1895
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,150
of the future work well actually about
nobody's talk i think that it could be a

nobody's talk i think that it could be a
 

1897
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,670
nobody's talk i think that it could be a
really good idea to

1898
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:21,680
really good idea to
 

1899
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,150
really good idea to
have maybe maybe some uh limitation

1900
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:26,160
have maybe maybe some uh limitation
 

1901
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,430
have maybe maybe some uh limitation

so we don't really need to limit anyone

1986
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:15,040
so we don't really need to limit anyone
 

1987

so we don't really need to limit anyone
to do anything what we need is just to

to do anything what we need is just to
 

1989
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,270
to do anything what we need is just to
provide an authority

1990
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:19,280
provide an authority
 

1991
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,390
provide an authority
uh people can believe in or verify

1992
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:22,400
uh people can believe in or verify
 

1993
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,230
uh people can believe in or verify
that this is really the authority that

1994
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:24,240
that this is really the authority that
 

1995
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,230
that this is really the authority that
provided this contract and

1996
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:26,240
provided this contract and
 

1997
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,430
provided this contract and
that means that if someone is uh

1998
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:29,440
that means that if someone is uh
 

1999
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,670
that means that if someone is uh
is impostering if someone is creating

2000
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:31,680
is impostering if someone is creating
 

2001

tools to verify
 

2011
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,069
tools to verify
that this is authentic pair connected to

2012
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:42,079
that this is authentic pair connected to
 

2013
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,990
that this is authentic pair connected to
the authentic name

2014
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:44,000
the authentic name
 

2015
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,630
the authentic name
and it's verifiable the rest is not up

2016
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:46,640
and it's verifiable the rest is not up
 

2017
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,150
and it's verifiable the rest is not up
to us and i don't think we need to limit

2018
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:48,160
to us and i don't think we need to limit
 

2019

know
of the of the address and of the token

2044
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:22,720
of the of the address and of the token
 

2045
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,430
of the of the address and of the token
then

2046
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:23,440
then
 

2047
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,309
then
you know um it can easily then verify

2048
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:26,319
you know um it can easily then verify
 

2049
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,990
you know um it can easily then verify
the whole chain and uh

2050
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,000
the whole chain and uh
 

2051
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,790
the whole chain and uh
and come to the price contract which

2052
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:30,800
and come to the price contract which
 

2053
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,710
and come to the price contract which
would be or or to the payer contract

2054
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:32,720
would be or or to the payer contract
 

2055
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,589
would be or or to the payer contract
sorry

2056
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:33,599
sorry
 

2057
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,630
sorry
um the stock contract which would be

2058
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:36,640
um the stock contract which would be
 

2059
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,190
um the stock contract which would be
uh you know which would be connected to

2060
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:39,200
uh you know which would be connected to
 

2061
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,069
uh you know which would be connected to
this authority

2062
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:40,079
this authority
 

2063
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,230
this authority
so in this in this case i think this is

2064
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:42,240
so in this in this case i think this is
 

2065
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,710
so in this in this case i think this is
the really good um

2066
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:44,720
the really good um
 

2067
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,150
the really good um

and everything in a completely
 

2071
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,630
and everything in a completely
decentralized censorship resistant model

2072
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:52,640
decentralized censorship resistant model
 

2073
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,670
decentralized censorship resistant model
um and and stuff so

2074
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:55,680
um and and stuff so
 

2075
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,510
um and and stuff so
yeah but right correct

yeah but right correct
so um is there anything else on the

2078
00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:03,359
so um is there anything else on the
 

2079
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,910
so um is there anything else on the
contract side that we're

2080
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:05,920
contract side that we're
 

2081
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:12,790
contract side that we're
kind of didn't cover

2082
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:12,800
kind of didn't cover
 

2083
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,549
kind of didn't cover
nikita mate do you have any more

2084
00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:14,559
nikita mate do you have any more
 

2085
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,069
nikita mate do you have any more
questions

2086
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:18,079

 

2087
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,870

no no i don't have questions

2088
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:22,880

 

2089
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,230

all right so kind of in total

2090
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:26,240
all right so kind of in total
 

2091
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,430
all right so kind of in total
so we have like several contracts

2092
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:29,440
so we have like several contracts
 

2093
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,109
so we have like several contracts
right they're all in the repository in

2094
00:50:31,109 --> 00:50:31,119
right they're all in the repository in
 

2095
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,870
right they're all in the repository in
the flex repository

2096
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:32,880
the flex repository
 

2097
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,790
the flex repository
and there there will be another public

2098
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:34,800
and there there will be another public
 

2099
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,030
and there there will be another public
repository for someone who wants to try

2100
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:37,040
repository for someone who wants to try
 

2101
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,549
repository for someone who wants to try
it but not for jewry

2102
00:50:38,549 --> 00:50:38,559
it but not for jewry
 

2103
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,710
it but not for jewry
we will put it in public repository but

2104
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:40,720
we will put it in public repository but
 

2105
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,230
we will put it in public repository but
in different branch not in the

2106
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:42,240
in different branch not in the
 

2107
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,349
in different branch not in the
main branch so so we don't confuse the

2108
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:45,359
main branch so so we don't confuse the
 

2109
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,030
main branch so so we don't confuse the
jury with the new code

2110
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:47,040
jury with the new code
 

2111
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,030
jury with the new code
right so that the code stays the same

2112
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:49,040
right so that the code stays the same
 

2113
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,710
right so that the code stays the same
and uh and after the

2114
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:50,720
and uh and after the
 

2115
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,549
and uh and after the
voting time finishes then we will move

2116
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:52,559
voting time finishes then we will move
 

2117
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,470
voting time finishes then we will move
it to the main repository

2118
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:54,480
it to the main repository
 

2119
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,230
it to the main repository
and with all the improvements that

2120
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:56,240
and with all the improvements that
 

2121
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,990
and with all the improvements that
andrew just mentioned

2122
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:58,000
andrew just mentioned
 

2123
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,190
andrew just mentioned
that they did and there are also some uh

2124
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:01,200
that they did and there are also some uh
 

2125
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,910
that they did and there are also some uh
debots so can you just quickly in one

2126
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:03,920
debots so can you just quickly in one
 

2127
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,710
debots so can you just quickly in one
minute cover what debuts we have

00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:06,720
minute cover what debuts we have
 

2129
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,230
minute cover what debuts we have
or maybe michael can do that because

2130
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:08,240
or maybe michael can do that because
 

2131
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,150
or maybe michael can do that because

00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:10,160
michael uh maybe we
 

2133
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,349
michael uh maybe we
need to like because andrew wrote some c

2134
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:13,359
need to like because andrew wrote some c
 

2135
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:14,710
need to like because andrew wrote some c

uh i don't know what
 

2175
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,589
uh i don't know what
i should explain in debate debot is

2176
00:52:19,589 --> 00:52:19,599
i should explain in debate debot is
 

2177
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,950
i should explain in debate debot is
a rather simple thing please

2178
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:22,960
a rather simple thing please
 

2179
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,150
a rather simple thing please
just take some data from

2180
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:26,160
just take some data from
 

2181
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,470
just take some data from
one contract and send it to another

2182
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:28,480
one contract and send it to another
 

2183
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,069
one contract and send it to another
contract or

2184
00:52:30,069 --> 00:52:30,079
contract or
 

2185
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,829
contract or
request input from user

2186
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:33,839
request input from user
 

2187
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:37,190
request input from user
uh i think that we

2188
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:37,200
uh i think that we
 

2189
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,630
uh i think that we
can show how we manipulate with prices

2190
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:42,640
can show how we manipulate with prices
 

2191
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:58,829
can show how we manipulate with prices
for example yeah

2192
00:52:58,829 --> 00:52:58,839

 

2193
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:02,870

we
 

2201
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,950
we
search price contracts in

2202
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:14,960
search price contracts in
 

2203
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,230
search price contracts in
graphql uh we receive uh

2204
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:18,240
graphql uh we receive uh
 

2205
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,670
graphql uh we receive uh
address of these contracts and uh

2206
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:21,680
address of these contracts and uh
 

2207
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,790
address of these contracts and uh
its data please please highlight uh

2208
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:24,800
its data please please highlight uh
 

2209
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,109
its data please please highlight uh
you know code for people so because

2210
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:29,119
you know code for people so because
 

2211
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:35,349
you know code for people so because
okay that is the interface call

2212
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:35,359
okay that is the interface call
 

2213
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,950
okay that is the interface call
we just put hash

2214
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:38,960
we just put hash
 

2215
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,630
we just put hash
of price contract that we received

2216
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:42,640
of price contract that we received
 

2217
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:47,030
of price contract that we received
from stock contract

2218
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:47,040
from stock contract
 

2219
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,069
from stock contract
uh we receive uh when we when we say

2220
00:53:50,069 --> 00:53:50,079
uh we receive uh when we when we say
 

2221
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,990
uh we receive uh when we when we say
receive we just we just executed locally

2222
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:52,000
receive we just we just executed locally
 

2223
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,030
receive we just we just executed locally
right

2224
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:53,040
right
 

2225
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,870
right
yes we execute it and

2226
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:56,880
yes we execute it and
 

2227
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,950
yes we execute it and
then you can hash it somehow

2228
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:00,960
then you can hash it somehow
 

2229
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,910
then you can hash it somehow
you don't need to call it every time

2230
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:05,920

 

2231
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,230

so we receive hash and now we

2232
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:10,240
so we receive hash and now we
 

2233
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,510
so we receive hash and now we
call sdk interface function

2234
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:13,520
call sdk interface function
 

2235
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,630
call sdk interface function
and we receive accounts uh

2236
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:16,640
and we receive accounts uh
 

2237
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,390
and we receive accounts uh
the arc data type

2238
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:20,400
the arc data type
 

2239
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,549
the arc data type
data consists of two files

2240
00:54:24,549 --> 00:54:24,559
data consists of two files
 

2241
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,589
data consists of two files
its account id and

2242
00:54:27,589 --> 00:54:27,599
its account id and
 

2243
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,270
its account id and
account data and

2244
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:31,280
account data and
 

2245
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,309
account data and
we just parse data and

2246
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:34,319
we just parse data and
 

2247
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:38,230
we just parse data and
don't call getters on

2248
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:38,240
don't call getters on
 

2249
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,349
don't call getters on
uh every contract uh

2250
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:41,359
uh every contract uh
 

2251
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:44,470
uh every contract uh
so it's uh increased speed because you

2252
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:44,480
so it's uh increased speed because you
 

2253
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,710
so it's uh increased speed because you
don't need to

2254
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:46,720
don't need to
 

2255
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,390
don't need to
download contracts and

2256
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:50,400
download contracts and
 

2257
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,510
download contracts and
run it locally yeah well you you so you

2258
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:53,520
run it locally yeah well you you so you
 

2259
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,950
run it locally yeah well you you so you
saw on the demonstration

2260
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:54,960
saw on the demonstration
 

2261
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,430
saw on the demonstration
how blistering fast that is it's like

2262
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:57,440
how blistering fast that is it's like
 

2263
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,230
how blistering fast that is it's like
really fast

2264
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:58,240
really fast
 

2265
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,109
really fast
because the tvm execute is is well it's

2266
00:55:01,109 --> 00:55:01,119
because the tvm execute is is well it's
 

2267
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,230
because the tvm execute is is well it's
microseconds

2268
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:02,240
microseconds
 

2269
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,470
microseconds
then you have when you have an sdk call

2270
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:04,480
then you have when you have an sdk call
 

2271
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,990
then you have when you have an sdk call
which is like about 100 200

2272
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:06,000
which is like about 100 200
 

2273
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,789
which is like about 100 200
milliseconds to get just on it maximum

2274
00:55:08,789 --> 00:55:08,799
milliseconds to get just on it maximum
 

2275
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,870
milliseconds to get just on it maximum
i'm talking about if you're on the other

2276
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:10,880
i'm talking about if you're on the other
 

2277
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,510
i'm talking about if you're on the other
part of the universe and then and then

2278
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:15,520
part of the universe and then and then
 

2279
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,150
part of the universe and then and then
and then again you don't need to as

2280
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:18,160
and then again you don't need to as
 

2281
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,230
and then again you don't need to as
misha said you just parse this

2282
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:20,240
misha said you just parse this
 

2283
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,789
misha said you just parse this
data that you received and from the sdk

2284
00:55:22,789 --> 00:55:22,799
data that you received and from the sdk
 

2285
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,549
data that you received and from the sdk
it's very fast

2286
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:24,559
it's very fast
 

2287
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:29,109
it's very fast
and we received from that we parse data

2288
00:55:29,109 --> 00:55:29,119
and we received from that we parse data
 

2289
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,309
and we received from that we parse data
and receive price sell and buy

2290
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:32,319
and receive price sell and buy
 

2291
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:38,309
and receive price sell and buy
orders count and then we

2292
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:38,319

 

2293
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:41,750

put it in array

2294
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:41,760
put it in array
 

2295
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,030
put it in array
and then just

2296
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:45,040
and then just
 

2297
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,950
and then just
print it out

2298
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:48,960
print it out
 

2299
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,109
print it out
so then here you have all the whole

2300
00:55:51,109 --> 00:55:51,119
so then here you have all the whole
 

2301
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,789
so then here you have all the whole
order book now you can operate on top of

2302
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:52,799
order book now you can operate on top of
 

2303
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:53,430
order book now you can operate on top of
that

2304
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:53,440
that
 

2305
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,750
that
right so you have you have a full order

2306
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:55,760
right so you have you have a full order
 

2307
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,630
right so you have you have a full order
book by just

2308
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:56,640
book by just
 

2309
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,829
book by just
searching the hash

2310
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:00,839

 

2311
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:03,910

yes uh

2312
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:03,920
yes uh
 

2313
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,710
yes uh
you also can calculate address of prices

2314
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:08,720
you also can calculate address of prices
 

2315
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,150
you also can calculate address of prices
we don't um

2316
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:12,160
we don't um
 

2317
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,270
we don't um
did it yet

2318
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:15,280

 

2319
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,109

and i think that

2320
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:19,119
and i think that
 

2321
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,470
and i think that
in future we

2322
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:22,480
in future we
 

2323
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,630
in future we
can calculate others by price

2324
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:26,640
can calculate others by price
 

2325
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,990
can calculate others by price
and don't need to

2326
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:30,000
and don't need to
 

2327
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,030
and don't need to
call to receive

2328
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:33,040
call to receive
 

2329
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,630
call to receive
all prices contracts

2330
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:36,640
all prices contracts
 

2331
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:43,109
all prices contracts
for example if you want to make deal on

2332
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:43,119

 

2333
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,230

on some price that you know so

2334
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:46,240
on some price that you know so
 

2335
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,270
on some price that you know so
you can just print it

2336
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:49,280
you can just print it
 

2337
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,349
you can just print it
and you

2338
00:56:53,349 --> 00:56:53,359
and you
 

2339
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:57,510
and you
can call contract immediately without

2340
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:57,520
can call contract immediately without
 

2341
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,069
can call contract immediately without
any

2342
00:56:58,069 --> 00:56:58,079
any
 

2343
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:02,069
any
delay yeah so that's that's also

2344
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:02,079
delay yeah so that's that's also
 

2345
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,470
delay yeah so that's that's also
something we are going to add

2346
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:04,480
something we are going to add
 

2347
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,950
something we are going to add
um

2348
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:08,960

 

2349
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,430

i don't know what else

2350
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:13,440
i don't know what else
 

2351
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,710
i don't know what else
it's just uh i'll show how you send the

2352
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:16,720
it's just uh i'll show how you send the
 

2353
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:22,630
it's just uh i'll show how you send the
the order maybe uh the order

2354
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:22,640

 

2355
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,309

cancel um for example cancel order or

2356
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:26,319
cancel um for example cancel order or
 

2357
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:29,430
cancel um for example cancel order or
buy order seller buy order and cancel

00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:29,440
buy order seller buy order and cancel
 

2359
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:41,349
buy order seller buy order and cancel
order for example

2360
00:57:41,349 --> 00:57:41,359
order for example
 

2361
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:44,950
order for example
uh deploy price with buyer that is price

2362
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:44,960
uh deploy price with buyer that is price
 

2363
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,150
uh deploy price with buyer that is price
order or buy order um so

2364
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:48,160
order or buy order um so
 

2365
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,270
order or buy order um so
for that we need

2366
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:51,280
for that we need
 

2367
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,589
for that we need
um to uh

2368
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:55,599
um to uh
 

2369
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,870
um to uh
build the cells and

2370
00:57:58,870 --> 00:57:58,880
build the cells and
 

2371
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,309
build the cells and
we use the vm build builder uh pack

2372
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:02,319
we use the vm build builder uh pack
 

2373
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:05,430
we use the vm build builder uh pack
structures uh

2374
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:05,440
structures uh
 

2375
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:10,150

you for andrew contracts
 

2377
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,430
you for andrew contracts
uh that we pack by

2378
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:13,440
uh that we pack by
 

2379
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,910
uh that we pack by
arguments uh it's uh

2380
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:17,920

sell price code and tiptoe violet andrew
 

2391
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,670
sell price code and tiptoe violet andrew
said about these parameters

2392
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:39,680
said about these parameters
 

2393
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,349
said about these parameters
in his debut and

2394
00:58:43,349 --> 00:58:43,359
in his debut and
 

2395
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:47,990
in his debut and
we just call one message to flex client

2396
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:48,000
we just call one message to flex client
 

2397
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,549
we just call one message to flex client
for deploy price with buy

2398
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:54,559

 

2399
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:58,150

i think that is all

2400
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:58,160

 

2401
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,910

okay for cancel order

2402
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:01,920
okay for cancel order
 

2403
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,349
okay for cancel order
it's the same we just

2404
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:05,359
it's the same we just
 

2405
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:09,829
it's the same we just
pack structures for android contracts

2406
00:59:09,829 --> 00:59:09,839
pack structures for android contracts
 

2407
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:13,670
pack structures for android contracts
and just just send it

2408
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:13,680
and just just send it
 

2409
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,430
and just just send it
in one message

2410
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:17,440

 

2411
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:23,670

yep really easy
