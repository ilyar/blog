to release the dao and finally it's in
 

313
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,669
to release the dao and finally it's in
production and it's we will be uh

314
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
production and it's we will be uh
 

315
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,990

gradually switching the current bridge

316
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
gradually switching the current bridge
 

317
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,990

to a new one uh
 

319
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,230
to a new one uh
so the next stage will be to test uh

320

so the next stage will be to test uh
 

321
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,870
so the next stage will be to test uh
everything in the main net

everything in the main net
 

323
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,390

if everything is fine after that we will
 

327

371
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,270

so we only deploy down

and so it's a very big big project

512
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120
and so it's a very big big project
 

513

uh
 

515
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,909
uh
yeah alexander you remember that's

516
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:17,919
yeah alexander you remember that's
 

517
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,510
yeah alexander you remember that's
that's why i'm saying that the breach is

not something simple
 

521
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,750
not something simple
so actually we had a discussion with

522
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
so actually we had a discussion with
 

523
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,950
so actually we had a discussion with
alexander about the nft bridge and uh

524
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:26,960
alexander about the nft bridge and uh
 

525
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,110
alexander about the nft bridge and uh
actually uh

526
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,120
actually uh
 

527
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,830
actually uh

about the funds raised

908
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,080
about the funds raised
 

909
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,830
about the funds raised
yeah uh two new funds now in interval we

910
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:11,840
yeah uh two new funds now in interval we
 

911
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,110
yeah uh two new funds now in interval we
are testing

912
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,120
are testing
 

913
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,389

uh will be in in october
uh it's one of the great great uh it's

922
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:23,600
uh it's one of the great great uh it's
 

923
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,149
uh it's one of the great great uh it's
one of our goal of why we are willing to

924
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:26,159
one of our goal of why we are willing to
 

925
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,230
one of our goal of why we are willing to
buy

926
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,240
buy
 

927
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,950
buy
yeah and actually uh i would also add

928
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
yeah and actually uh i would also add
 

929
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,310
yeah and actually uh i would also add
that um

930
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:32,320
that um
 

931
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,990
that um
the main um kpi was not the number of

932
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,000
the main um kpi was not the number of
 

933
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,470
the main um kpi was not the number of
funds but rather the amount of liquidity

934
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:38,480
funds but rather the amount of liquidity
 

935
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,870
funds but rather the amount of liquidity
that is it is attracted to the free tone

936
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:40,880
that is it is attracted to the free tone
 

937
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,990
that is it is attracted to the free tone
and with these kpis we over performed

938
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,000
and with these kpis we over performed
 

939
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,029
and with these kpis we over performed
and

940
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:45,039
and
 

941
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,029
and
if i'm not wrong it's okay

942
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:47,039
if i'm not wrong it's okay
 

943
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,190
if i'm not wrong it's okay
what was it 10 million

944
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,200
what was it 10 million
 

945
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,110
what was it 10 million
locked in tvl

946
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,120
locked in tvl
 

947
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,750
locked in tvl
now we have almost 30

948
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:53,760
now we have almost 30
 

949
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,710
now we have almost 30
so

950
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:54,720
so
 

951
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,710
so
it's it's a very very good

952
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:56,720
it's it's a very very good
 

953
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,950
it's it's a very very good
overperformance

954
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:58,960
overperformance
 

955
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,909
overperformance
uh so the third question is that the

956
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:01,919
uh so the third question is that the
 

957
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,230
uh so the third question is that the

00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:09,519
question is what are the gateways and
 

965
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,590
question is what are the gateways and
providers what stage is the integration

966
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:11,600
providers what stage is the integration
 

967
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,830
providers what stage is the integration
at

968
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:13,840

 

969
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,310

i uh i will answer only about about

970
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,320
i uh i will answer only about about
 

971
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,310
i uh i will answer only about about
public public integrations what was did

972

because it's very it's very hard to

1014
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,120
because it's very it's very hard to
 

1015

integrate full full node
 

1017
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,669
integrate full full node
and there are a lot of issues with it

1018
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:09,679
and there are a lot of issues with it
 

1019
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,310

in
white paper and uh it would be quite

1386
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,240
white paper and uh it would be quite
 

1387
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,390
white paper and uh it would be quite
natural

1388
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:44,400
natural
 

1389
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:44,550
natural

have some

1394
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:48,480
have some
 

1395
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,550
have some
branding or a launch

1396
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:50,560
branding or a launch
 

1397
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,510
branding or a launch
at the point when we finally

1398
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:53,520
at the point when we finally
 

1399
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,630
at the point when we finally
moved to another code another

1400
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:56,640
moved to another code another
 

1401
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,829
moved to another code another
yeah

1402
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:57,839
yeah
 

1403
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,990
yeah
that's my view because

1404
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:00,000
that's my view because
 

1405
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,310
that's my view because
it will be very very strange to do it

1406
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:02,320
it will be very very strange to do it
 

1407
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,270
it will be very very strange to do it
like in the middle of those process

1408
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:05,280
like in the middle of those process
 

1409
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,470
like in the middle of those process
okay that's again that's my view

1410
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:08,480
okay that's again that's my view
 

1411
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,589
okay that's again that's my view
thank you now vladimir please

1412

thank you now vladimir please
 

1413
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,790
thank you now vladimir please
yeah we have we had this discussion with

1414
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:14,800
yeah we have we had this discussion with
 

1415
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,750
yeah we have we had this discussion with
different uh members of aliens and other

1416
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:17,760
different uh members of aliens and other
 

1417
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,390
different uh members of aliens and other
validators i think the majority right

1418
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:20,400
validators i think the majority right
 

1419
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,990
validators i think the majority right
now thinks it's worth to do and uh my i

1420
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,000
now thinks it's worth to do and uh my i
 

1421
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,390
now thinks it's worth to do and uh my i
share quite the same opinion

1422
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:26,400
share quite the same opinion
 

1423
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,430
share quite the same opinion
uh i but i still think it's uh

1424
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:29,440
uh i but i still think it's uh
 

1425
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,829
uh i but i still think it's uh
that we we have a decentralized system

1426
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:31,839
that we we have a decentralized system
 

1427
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,309
that we we have a decentralized system
consensus uh we should

1428
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:34,319
consensus uh we should
 

1429
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,630
consensus uh we should
decide make decision based on this

1430
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:36,640
decide make decision based on this
 

1431
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,589
decide make decision based on this
consensus uh that's the first point the

1432
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:39,599
consensus uh that's the first point the
 

1433
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,589
consensus uh that's the first point the
second point i agree with pavel that it

1434
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:41,599
second point i agree with pavel that it
 

1435
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,670
second point i agree with pavel that it
should be done like in some logical

1436
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:43,680
should be done like in some logical
 

1437
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,710
should be done like in some logical
fashion at some point for example when

1438
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:46,720
fashion at some point for example when
 

1439
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,510
fashion at some point for example when
we switch to the rust nodes and when we

1440
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:49,520
we switch to the rust nodes and when we
 

1441
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,870
we switch to the rust nodes and when we
abandon the

1442
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:50,880
abandon the
 

1443
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,230
abandon the
kind of code base of telegram that's a

1444
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:54,240
kind of code base of telegram that's a
 

1445
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,710
kind of code base of telegram that's a
kind of logical step uh when it's

1446
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:56,720
kind of logical step uh when it's
 

1447
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,430
kind of logical step uh when it's
perfect uh logical perfect logical step

1448
00:40:59,430 --> 00:40:59,440
perfect uh logical perfect logical step
 

1449
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,430
perfect uh logical perfect logical step
for rebranding because we abandoned the

1450
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:01,440
for rebranding because we abandoned the
 

1451
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,510
for rebranding because we abandoned the
code and we changed the name that makes

1452
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:03,520
code and we changed the name that makes
 

1453
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,390
code and we changed the name that makes
sense

1454
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:04,400
sense
 

1455
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,030
sense
and my last uh thought on that is that

1456
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:07,040
and my last uh thought on that is that
 

1457
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,990
and my last uh thought on that is that
we have a good example of polygon

1458
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:10,000
we have a good example of polygon
 

1459
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,670
we have a good example of polygon
which was uh rebranded from matic and um

1460
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:13,680
which was uh rebranded from matic and um
 

1461
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,190
which was uh rebranded from matic and um
i mean it worked perfectly though

1462
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:17,200
i mean it worked perfectly though
 

1463
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,670
i mean it worked perfectly though
a lot of people were skeptical about it

1464
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:19,680
a lot of people were skeptical about it
 

1465
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,910
a lot of people were skeptical about it
when it happened but we have this good

1466
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:21,920
when it happened but we have this good
 

1467
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,470
when it happened but we have this good
example and that means that we should

1468
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:24,480
example and that means that we should
 

1469
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,630
example and that means that we should
really think about doing the same that's

1470
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:26,640
really think about doing the same that's
 

1471
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,190
really think about doing the same that's
my personal opinion

1472
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:29,200

1473
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,950
