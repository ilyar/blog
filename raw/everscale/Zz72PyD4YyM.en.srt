i
 

43
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,950
i
went through the solutions very briefly

44
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960
went through the solutions very briefly
 

45
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,229
went through the solutions very briefly
there are six of them

46
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
there are six of them
 

47
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,670
there are six of them
so five uh on top of tonlap solution and

48
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
so five uh on top of tonlap solution and
 

49
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,310
so five uh on top of tonlap solution and
i didn't find any solution that would be

50
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
i didn't find any solution that would be
 

51
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,709
i didn't find any solution that would be
similar in terms of architecture so if i

52
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
similar in terms of architecture so if i
 

53
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,430

order book it executes it's
 

213
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,070
order book it executes it's
in a single block it's extremely fast

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,350
and let's wait until it will be done a
couple of seconds

526
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360
couple of seconds
 

527
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,110
couple of seconds
yeah and uh-huh

528
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
yeah and uh-huh
 

529
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,430
yeah and uh-huh
please wait a little we should wait

530
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440
please wait a little we should wait
 

531
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,949
please wait a little we should wait
little

532
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
little
 

533
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,189
little
yeah it's done balance zero so now i

534
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:45,199
yeah it's done balance zero so now i
 

535
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,269
yeah it's done balance zero so now i
want to buy this token 35 000

536
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:47,279
want to buy this token 35 000
 

537
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,430
want to buy this token 35 000
i see someone is selling for one i think

538
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,440
i see someone is selling for one i think
 

539
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,430
i see someone is selling for one i think
it's a good price let's just do that i

540
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
it's a good price let's just do that i
 

541
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,790
it's a good price let's just do that i
want to buy

542
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
want to buy
 

543
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,230
want to buy
let's say 500 of this and yeah

544
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
let's say 500 of this and yeah
 

545
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,269
let's say 500 of this and yeah
that's 500 tons

546
00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
that's 500 tons
 

547
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,030
that's 500 tons
which will be deducted from my account

548
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,040
which will be deducted from my account
 

549
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,629
which will be deducted from my account
and you know

550
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
and you know
 

551
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,189
and you know
and the tokens will be supposed to be

552
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:05,199
and the tokens will be supposed to be
 

553
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:05,670
and the tokens will be supposed to be
mine

554
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
mine
 

555
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,069
mine
let's see

556
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079

 

557
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,509

and of course it's a demo so

558
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
and of course it's a demo so
 

559
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,870
and of course it's a demo so
something went wrong i guess

560
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
something went wrong i guess
 

561
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,189
something went wrong i guess
so yeah just message didn't so let's

562
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199
so yeah just message didn't so let's
 

563
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,550
so yeah just message didn't so let's
retry it

564
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560

 

565
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,230

it's done all right let's us uh

566
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
it's done all right let's us uh
 

567
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,269
it's done all right let's us uh
wait a little for the execution

568
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
wait a little for the execution
 

569
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,670
wait a little for the execution
actually for update not the execution

570
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,680
actually for update not the execution
 

571
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,030
actually for update not the execution
yeah it's done

572
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
yeah it's done
 

573
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,350
yeah it's done
so it's it's you can see here it's 34

574
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
so it's it's you can see here it's 34
 

575
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,710
so it's it's you can see here it's 34
500 so it's actually

576
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:40,720
500 so it's actually
 

577
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,310
500 so it's actually
executed already now we just wait for

578
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
executed already now we just wait for
 

579
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,230
executed already now we just wait for
the message for the account update

580
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,240
the message for the account update
 

581
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,030
the message for the account update
the exchange is actually being processed

582
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
the exchange is actually being processed
 

583
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,750
the exchange is actually being processed
so now we have 53 balance 500 that's it

584
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
so now we have 53 balance 500 that's it
 

585
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,790
so now we have 53 balance 500 that's it
so last thing i wanted is to show you

586
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:52,800
so last thing i wanted is to show you
 

587
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,509
so last thing i wanted is to show you
what's so significant about that in our

588
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:55,519
what's so significant about that in our
 

589
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,590
what's so significant about that in our
view so let me share another screen

590
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:57,600
view so let me share another screen
 

591
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,710
view so let me share another screen
and just explain how it actually works

592
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:00,720
and just explain how it actually works
 

593
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,470
and just explain how it actually works
and what's the difference between that

594
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
and what's the difference between that
 

595
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,550
and what's the difference between that
and any other implementation

596
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
and any other implementation
 

597
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,069
and any other implementation
what you have been witnessed is the

598
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:06,079
what you have been witnessed is the
 

599
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,069
what you have been witnessed is the
first i think distributed

600
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
first i think distributed
 

601
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,269
first i think distributed
order book and the thing is that

602
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:11,279
order book and the thing is that
 

603
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,189
order book and the thing is that
this order book doesn't work like a

604
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
this order book doesn't work like a
 

605
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,430
this order book doesn't work like a
usual order book on the blockchains but

606
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
usual order book on the blockchains but
 

607
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,350
usual order book on the blockchains but
that you see which has failed

608
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
that you see which has failed
 

609
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,389
that you see which has failed
every time it has been tried because the

610
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
every time it has been tried because the
 

611
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,470
every time it has been tried because the
order book can be very large

612
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
order book can be very large
 

613
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,629
order book can be very large
and the operations on order book are

614
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
and the operations on order book are
 

615
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,750
and the operations on order book are
very hard

616
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:25,760
very hard
 

617
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,670
very hard
to do so usually all the blockchain

618
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,680
to do so usually all the blockchain
 

619
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,590
to do so usually all the blockchain
projects that try to do the order book

620
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
projects that try to do the order book
 

621
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,269
projects that try to do the order book
contract failed

622
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:33,279
contract failed
 

623
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,030
contract failed
and they will fail even on town and

624
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,040
and they will fail even on town and
 

625
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,389
and they will fail even on town and
doesn't matter where

626
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
doesn't matter where
 

627
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,189
doesn't matter where
they will just fail you cannot create an

628
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199
they will just fail you cannot create an
 

629
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,189
they will just fail you cannot create an
order book in a smart contract

630
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:41,199
order book in a smart contract
 

631
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,829
order book in a smart contract
doesn't matter how fast is your

632
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
doesn't matter how fast is your
 

633
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:44,790
doesn't matter how fast is your
blockchain

634
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
blockchain
 

635
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,990
blockchain
because it can have millions operations

636
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
because it can have millions operations
 

637
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,350
because it can have millions operations
iterations over a table and you just

638
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
iterations over a table and you just
 

639
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,230
iterations over a table and you just
cannot do that

640
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240
cannot do that
 

641
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,069
cannot do that
it will be painfully slow it will not

642
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079
it will be painfully slow it will not
 

643
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,150
it will be painfully slow it will not
work in a large scale it won't be

644
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
work in a large scale it won't be
 

645
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,509
work in a large scale it won't be

so what we have created as a distributed

648
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,240
so what we have created as a distributed
 

649
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,949
so what we have created as a distributed
order book

650
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:02,959
order book
 

651
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,189
order book
meaning what happens really is you have

652
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
meaning what happens really is you have
 

653
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,790
meaning what happens really is you have
an exchange route and it works very

654
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:06,800
an exchange route and it works very
 

655
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,949
an exchange route and it works very
similar to in the same principles and as

656
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:08,959
similar to in the same principles and as
 

657
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,829
similar to in the same principles and as
we're promoting

658
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:09,839
we're promoting
 

659
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,550
we're promoting
all the time in tip three tip two and

660
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:12,560
all the time in tip three tip two and
 

661
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,670
all the time in tip three tip two and
now this flex

662
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
now this flex
 

663
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,629
now this flex
so we create a tip three tone pair which

664
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:16,639
so we create a tip three tone pair which
 

665
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,269
so we create a tip three tone pair which
has a

666
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279
has a
 

667
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,629
has a
special code and then it deploys

668
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,639
special code and then it deploys
 

669
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,269
special code and then it deploys
a price contract for every price that

670
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
a price contract for every price that
 

671
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,790
a price contract for every price that
you want to sell to

672
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
you want to sell to
 

673
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,949
you want to sell to
and this price contract is a separate

674
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
and this price contract is a separate
 

675
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,470
and this price contract is a separate
contract it doesn't have

676
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,480
contract it doesn't have
 

677
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,870
contract it doesn't have
a single order book it has just one

678
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:30,880
a single order book it has just one
 

679
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,829
a single order book it has just one
price

680
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:31,839
price
 

681
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,990
price
and this price is searchable by hash

682
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
and this price is searchable by hash
 

683
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,189
and this price is searchable by hash
so it's retrievable from the database

684
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
so it's retrievable from the database
 

685
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,430
so it's retrievable from the database
extremely fast to the client side but

686
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,440
extremely fast to the client side but
 

687
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,749
extremely fast to the client side but
the client side is actually operating on

00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:43,759
the client side is actually operating on
 

689
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,629
the client side is actually operating on
the order book

690
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:44,639
the order book
 

691
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,350
the order book

731
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,029
that has been deployed meaning there is
some trading in there so you see the

some trading in there so you see the
 

733
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,710
some trading in there so you see the
order actually order book
