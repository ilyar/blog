hello everyone
and welcome to
the first broxxos elisium hackathon so
that takes place in this beautiful city
of belgrade in serbia so it's a pleasant
lovely sunny day outside but we
preferred
to stay inside this day because it's
very hot
so before we start so actually just a
few words uh about the hackathon and
about uh how it will be going on so
today is uh the day when we will tell
you about the
everscale which is a network we are
mostly building our products on we will
tell you about
our own products and what broxus is
what we are doing and who we are
next we will have uh two presentations
uh
specifically for developers explaining
how uh their solidity forever scale
works actually and what's the difference
with the ethereum one for example
and uh
last but not least we will tell you
about the architecture of the octus
bridge which is our focus product uh for
today's hackathon
uh so uh we will make a break in between
so uh somewhat about 3 p.m
just for you to have
snacks and also communicate with each
other and
we are also uh looking into uh
completing all the teams for hackathon
until 5 pm today so please if you don't
have the team yet so
or
you don't understand what you want to do
or maybe otherwise you have your own
idea and you need some team members so
don't hesitate to add to our discord
server and
communicate with others so uh those who
are offline so we have anthony here so
who is
completing all the teams and so if you
have any doubts please feel free to come
to him and
and
yeah this site decides whatever
uh so um we are opening this hackathon
so this is a pleasant day with uh uh
opening presentation about uh the
everscale network um
this is a blockchain of the fifth
generation
uh which was developed uh
more than two years ago
with um
oppa uh it's not working
um
yeah so it was developed uh more than
two years ago uh by a group of
institutionals who decided to create a
network a blockchain that really uh is
able to face the difficulties that
appear in
nowadays especially you all remember all
these cases with ethereum with solana so
when uh even a few applications a few
high load applications could stall the
whole network so and um
those uh initial members of the network
so they did tremendous work uh to polish
everything and build the most scalable
network to date so for now so it's uh
the fastest uh i'm not afraid of saying
this the fastest network uh to date
uh so
uh we have made a really sorrow test uh
the real-time test uh on the network
last year so where we had 400 validators
stressed with extreme workloads with uh
different slashing mechanisms and and so
on and so forth so and we managed to
break the world record with 50k 54k 1054
000 transactions per second sorry
uh this is today's uh
actually what solana is pro has promised
but it never reached this this figure
also everscale supports of course the
touring complete smart contracts and we
have compilers in solidity and c plus
plus so most of the evm developers so uh
can
much easier on board to
programming forever skill
it has a lot of uh
use user features a lot of
configurations that allow network to be
really scalable it allows creation and
creation of uh custom work chains uh i
will speak about this a bit later
with custom set of configurations and
even its own set of validators
and uh last but not least so uh the
transaction fees on the network is
extremely cheap and
it will be even cheaper in future thanks
to a new consensus and new
uh
upgrade of node software that's coming
in a few months
yeah so you can see here so actually uh
how everscale is built
it has a master chain that serves as an
index
for
blocks that are finalized in the work
chains and the number of these work
chains
can be extremely big and also each work
chain can also chart in almost
infinitely so you can see the
uh
scale up to which it you can
shard it's 2 to power of 60 it's
theoretical estimation of course
there is no such uh
application in the world that will
require such such workloads but
uh even theoretically so we can uh
reach the uh throughput of 1 million tps
and
thanks to everscale architecture so it
can scale the workload linearly so
meaning that if you add more throughput
you just add new validators and the
network starts working more and more
productive
um and also of course so uh as soon as
network uh splits so uh it means that uh
each heart operates independently until
it's merged back and even if anything
goes wrong with one specific shards the
all the smart contracts deployed in
other charts they can easily continue to
work
everscale uses the bft
proof of stake consensus
now so and we plan to migrate to even
more
uh advanced uh
soft majority uh fault tolerant
pos consensus soon so currently uh the
new upgrade for node software has been
developed in this very moment and
hopefully we will see it within a couple
of months
and it will give us even more stability
and the possibility to scale the network
even more
and
actually how the network works it works
is that you have independent validators
so anyone can raise this validator he
just needs to ensure that there is a
minimum stake of something like hundred
thousand uh
evers which is a native currency of uh
of the network pretty much like uh other
is the one for ethereum
and uh so but uh it's not obligatory to
do it yourself because
the fancy feature of the network is the
usage of specific smart contracts called
depools that allow you to collect money
from the audience and
you just need to provide the minimum
stake for your validator and all the
rest to grab from from the community
uh and these depools later
they are transferring your stakes to the
central smart contract called elector so
which then runs the auction for for
validators
uh currently there are over 200 of live
validators and the number is count is
growing uh daily so and uh
yeah so actually with our efforts uh on
promoting our scale also in asian
markets especially in on the middle east
we are seeing a lot of newcomers a lot
of new validators uh coming into the
network so
hopefully so uh we will see a lot of new
offensive projects to appear on every
scale after this hackathon
also what
we have focused on doing since the very
start of the network is to make it very
well connected to all other existing
networks because we clearly understand
that uh the majority of the developers
especially blockchain developers are
currently uh working on evm chains
especially and on the new generation
chains like solana polkadot near and
certain others
and
we have selected the most popular ones
and have created bridges to them so you
can see just a number of networks that
are connected ethereum goes uh by
default of course we it's not even
specified here but it was the first
bridge uh built to ethereum but also we
enjoyed the british polygon phantom
avalanche bnb milk comedy cardano tezos
so and uh
two more bridges are coming to solana
and to near
uh and uh
we are making this uh connectivity in
such a way that uh developers can
continue doing the the apps on any of
the preferred networks but as soon as
they need the cross chain uh
feature for the
business processes or for the
functionality so they can easily use uh
octus bridge and error scale on the on
the back end
to
reaches with a really really minimum uh
cost
uh also it is governed in a
decentralized fashion so meaning that
there is no single uh vector of attack
on the network uh and uh it is quite
difficult now to to
to
almost impossible to reach
the
70 plus something percentage of control
over the network to
to
anything you want with it so it's almost
impossible
uh
just a few figures uh to show you about
the network uh so we
uh
come into a new record on the network of
800 000 uh accounts live accounts that
are working on the network and uh
i just posted uh the previous record of
maybe a one or so week ago so you see we
are almost uh grown by additional 40 000
and hopefully we will reach 800 000 by
end of next week
there are uh 38 million of ordinary
transactions so i'm specifically
indicating this because these are
transactions created by the uh smart
contracts and by users who are doing the
transfers or purchasing some nfts or
doing they think on in different games
uh because there are a lot of also
ordinary uh
service transactions like tick tock
transactions that are
helping contracts to function and if we
count those so it will be uh over 120
000 20 million of transactions actually
uh reached on the network
uh as i said more than 200 uh validators
uh now here and 54k tps throughput
uh we have officially launched the
mainnet in uh back in may 2020 so we are
more than two years in production and
recently we have celebrated
the two years of everscale uh in
indonesia so we have uh had a great
party over there so
i really expect the next year so and
everyone please come so also to we have
a lot of cool stuff going on on
our celebrations
and
what i have said so the transaction cost
for
running anything on everscale is
extremely small so even now so you can
see that the ordinary transaction costs
you less than 1000
of dollar
so
speaking about the features i mostly
covered all of them so just
let's move further
um
as i said our scale has appeared as an
answer to the existence problems of the
blockchain and of uh the web3 in general
so because we have seen a dramatic
growth of interest in
blockchain development on different
networks but unfortunately uh
you remember so there is something like
uh
post ethereum uh distress
older distressed some disease on this
screen shown um a lot of people have
suffered from the high commissions and
it was almost impossible to use the
network and uh a lot of developers have
started thinking about moving to some
layer 2 solutions
or maybe to some
new new networks but
the main problem that we have seen is
that lots of
existing
blockchain projects
have started pretty much typically like
um
any other startups also they gathered
the money so they started aggressive
marketing promising a lot but in the end
uh the technology is really struggling
to follow their promises
and uh on everscale actually we
preach
a different approach and uh we first
build and promote
and uh this allowed us to build a fully
functioning ecosystem of defy and nft
it allowed us to bring the excellent
connectivity to other networks and let
developers to easily migrate to
everscale
and you can see that
now almost any of existing applications
can easily fit within uh error scale and
benefit from its crocheting connections
um now let's speak a bit about the
ecosystem so what's going on actually so
who who are all these people who are
actually on their scale uh this is this
terrible slide just to show you um
a bit of a small piece of ecosystem
actually the major project so they're
quite a number but
i would like all just to highlight the
category so we have a lot of focus on
gaming and nft and
by the way it's really a strong focus on
gamify and meta versus here
and we expect a lot of new solutions to
appear we have a lot of games that are
currently being developed or integrated
with every scale so and we expect really
really a good uplift after the
integration is finished of course the
fight so
well
liquidity is a blood of any blockchain
ecosystem so and of course we have
started from defy so we have uh fully
functional exchanges we have uh
uh bridges we have wallets with three
connectors and all the stuff we have
landing protocols we have launch pads
uh so i can continue and continue so
quite a rich system for any need of a us
developer
a lot of
tools and different services that are
currently integrated with everscale so
not obligatory they're doing really
something big on chain but they also
support the native currency and tokens
of the network in their own solutions uh
there are even some serbian names by the
way you have you can see them here so
and maybe you could see the trucks of
papousti uh driving in the streets
with uh our brandon
as well so uh there was a partnership
with those two companies last year
a lot of media partnership of course so
that we have started last year
as i said we first built then we started
the promotion and we have a strategic
partnership with coin telegraph so you
can also see that they are one of the
key media that has partnered with the
listing hackathon as well
we have reached a lot of tier 1
exchanges now so you can see them here
so two recent editions are huab and
kucoin that have listed uh ever
uh
it was maybe two or three weeks ago so
now they are doing this natively and uh
most probably they will also support uh
some of everscale unique features as
well
and of course some
coin ranking services so all the major
services that you may think of so have
already supported server scale
uh a bit of focus on maybe on key
products uh so it's a lot of text here
so and all the presentations so they
will be available on our discord
afterwards so don't don't worry so that
you cannot read it now so but
uh just want to
show you that a lot of uh good and uh
well designed applications exist now on
our scale so that you can inspire from
most of them are open source by the way
so when you can
go to github of the major developers and
inspire with a source of code and how
you should write your applications and
so on so forth uh and also
a lot of things of course are coming and
are not shown here but just join the
communities forever scale to to learn
more
um i will focus now maybe a bit uh on
the key
uh
blocks that uh make everscale alive now
so and so that attracts the most of the
community attention so um first of all
everscale is decentralized from uh
groups routes to to the very top meaning
that uh its architecture is
decentralized its governance is
decentralized everything is neutralized
even tokens
and
every dow that was launched a few months
ago so uh
made the decentralized governance real
so uh for now we have uh more than 80 of
uh proposals uh important proposals
deciding uh what will be the future of
the network that has passed uh some a
number of them that has not passed so
and uh in order to vote or never doubt
so you actually need to lock a certain
stake that will be equal to the number
of your votes and that uh lets you as a
community member even if you have a
minor stake but you can also
express your opinion and also affect
the
solution on certain proposal
uh in future so what we are planning to
do is um
create a liquid staking protocol that
will allow you
to
simultaneously uh stake your uh
errors within the pools so getting some
rewards for it so money will be working
for for you
and at the same time the tokens that you
will get in return so of course they
will have also some additional value and
uh one of the features will be the
opportunity to vote on everdel so and
this will radically increase uh the
amount staked
in this protocol
by the way it's already open source so
we have published in open source just
recently so
didn't update the presentation
uh next we have a lot of excellent
connectivity tools for development
of web applications and
standalone applications
you have a constellation of different
wallets that support
in a bit different way uh
but all of them generally provide you
with opportunity to easily connect to
the network uh using uh the approach
pretty similar to like uh
a web3 of metamask does
yeah you can do a lot with this thing
you can send different payloads you can
call contracts you can deploy anything
so
quite a lot of stuff can be done with
this
about the breach so uh
we will talk a bit uh later so it's not
only october's bridge that exists on the
network so we have a lot of uh well a
number of uh other bridges that are
currently in an experimental stage and
uh
they are being developed also to target
specific networks like tezus or cardano
and uh those networks uh
and teams from those networks will soon
be able also to
join the everscale community
next we have uh at least
four or five dexes existing on our scale
so the largest one is a flat cube
developed by bruxus but also we have the
flex developed by everex team so it is
the order book based uh
decks pretty similar to serum on solana
and uh the guys are doing the last
polishing before the public release so
now they are in the late beta
uh i really hope that they will succeed
with it
and also a number of other indexes that
you can benefit by joining their scale
uh also uh we have quite a number of nft
marketplaces
and grand bazaar of them is the largest
one
and
well quite a number of
artists and content creators are now
joining and also speaking about nft
and our target uh expansion to gamify
and metaverse so we are now
uh have uh finally uh approved the
upgrade of the nft standard it's called
tip four tip four point one two and so
so for different purposes uh and uh we
will also expand it beyond uh just pure
uh
nfts that store some some pictures so
which is of course is 99 of application
now for nfts but we're looking a bit
behind this and uh we will also expand
the standard to cover the needs of
different applications like tokenization
different assets like insurance uh
certificates uh like the
decentralized name services and so on so
forth so quite quite a number of
applications that will be included in uh
nft standard
um we have launched uh
two or three months ago the uh official
launch pad for
everscale it's called everstart that
allows you to
launch your product and also collect
some initial funding
for now it works in a semi-moderated uh
way but later it will migrate to dao
based approach and
decisions on which projects to list are
never down or not so will be taken
through them so already uh five projects
has launched on the uh ever start so
it's it's a small number but uh it's a
beginning humble beginning
and uh so we expect really a lot a lot
of newcomers to launch soon
uh
uh also uh everscale is not only about a
crypto and nft so it's important to
understand that this network can really
withstand the workloads of the
traditionality businesses and one of the
applications that we are currently
negotiating actively with different
countries is the deployment of different
cbdc mechanism actually on uh on our
scale which includes not only the
currency function but it also includes a
lot of security controls a lot of
permissioning and so on so forth
and uh
everscale is capable of fitting
with a needs actually because you can
imagine the amount of transactions that
are done in the real world with the fiat
money so just
only visa generate something like 20
ktps on average
with a big one it was something like 55
even wrong
during some world championship
championship
and uh so actually visa can wholly fit
within every scale now
uh yeah so there are some some features
that already exist in every scale that
are capable of
and useful for cbdc deployment
um
let's speak about the community and
contribute main contributors to ever
scale so actually
we have started as a company from the
eastern europe and of course the
majority of the community initially was
from there
but
since the
end of 2020
already so we have started the rep
expansion to asian region and now we
have a really strong community in korea
in vietnam and malaysia in indonesia now
we approach in japan and
in any case uh really building a strong
partnership with local players
uh and
in europe specifically we have uh
now a really strong partners who are
developing never scale for european
countries so it's only a start for
europe and uh so we intentionally
decided to learn to run this hackathon
here in belgrade because we
have broadcast headquarters here and
also we
really enjoy uh how you guys are doing
here in serbia and nearby region
uh and we of course having our plans uh
a further expansion to all around the
world we have communities also from
mexico from canada from the u.s but then
still not very big so and the majority
of communities are coming to the
eurasia continent
uh so
let's speak about the main contributors
who are making uh the key products
forever scale so i will start humbly
with with the process with my company
so we are
initially the defy developers who are
focusing uh on creation of useful
functionalities for uh
proficient place professional players on
the market and for traders
uh
so and uh with the launch of everscale
so we are also focusing on building the
basic layer of defined for structures
that can be later used
by anyone
we will have a dedicated presentation
for brooks about broxos and our
technologies
come in the next so i will not stop here
the next one is everex uh who which is a
company who initially developed all the
node software and uh
this is something that's uh
really crucial because those guys made
almost impossible and have created uh
implemented actually all the things from
white paper of everscale they are one of
the main visionaries and
developers of ever cloud
software that now allows to any
developer enjoy the graphql connection
to everscale with this without any
additional charge
i.t gold is one of the principal
developers of nft infrastructure and we
have alex with us today from i.t gold so
one of our mentors
so
guys are doing a lot to popularize nft
uh in on a scale so they have launched
not only uh grand bazaar but they also
made the open source framework for nft
marketplaces and uh
for everyone to easily build
new ones for specific use cases so you
can see just a number of
uh
the most popular ones like third place
which tokenizes the real uh art and
chess nft in the partnership with fide
so uh the official nft marketplace of
international chess federation
um
neil foundation uh as a techie guys who
are doing a lot of audits and
a lot of frameworks for testing for of
every skill uh
i think it best says for them they they
github so just go go to the github slash
new foundation so you will see a lot of
things that they are doing and
they are really
really deep into the technology
uh ever gaming uh so uh used to be the
group of people who uh have collaborated
about the promotion of gaming and
e-gaming esports in nevada scale so now
they have launched their own brand
and uh you can see quite a number of
people that have already joined
the
everscale community
and we have a number of professional uh
esports teams one which has recently
relocated here
so they they're really cool guys
and they have a lot of things to come so
a really big roadmap so just uh feel
free to follow them
uh pokertown so is one of uh
the largest uh poker
clubs on telegram so counting thousands
of players and
always live so they were one of the
initial
projects that supported our scale and uh
integrated
it
behind the curtain and so now you can
easily play forever so in poketown and
uh they're playing also to expand with a
number of different games
uh and uh recently we have moved towards
uh launching of everscale foundation
which is uh the
institution that will officially
represent our skill behind
uh the major uh
behind governments and represent on
different uh
conferences so and uh all of the
promotion stuff will go under they
control so um
there are six initial members of
everscale foundation all from this
industry with the vast experience and
network so uh who will bring a lot of
value and you can see also that we have
selected people uh from different
regions to better represent our scale in
them so we have people from europe from
north america from latim from asia uh
from from middle east uh
so those guys uh i actively uh
promote another scale now
within big uh funds and big investors uh
explaining directly the benefits of
error scale to
to countries to governments and so on so
forth so and
definitely you will see them
uh
much more later
uh
a few words about the roadmaps of what
actually everscale uh we'll be doing the
in the nearest future so we are right
now here so you see that uh
here are some major points that we have
done but quite a lot is to be done yet
so uh
uh including the update of our uh
consensus protocol about the update of
uh
creation the possibility and the builder
for dows on everscale so actually
you already can now
benefit from the dow deployed by
roxas team so
you can take the sources and deploy your
own one but we want to make it much
easier for projects to
benefit
also we
are planning to
i'm sorry
to expand more on gamified metaverse
projects
on the decentralized fund protocols on
nft bridges and quite a lot
so uh
it's important to understand that uh on
a scale so you don't have a single team
that's developing everything
you have a lot of passionate uh
communities a lot of patient developers
who are focusing on developing their own
business and are doing this in ever
skill way decentralized
uh with strong focus on community uh
drilling approach
open sourcing uh most critical parts and
all this in everything so this is
something that really differs the
everscale community from most of the
other blockchain projects
just to highlight maybe a few things
that
are going to come
in the nearest future so first of all is
the smft consensus
that
will allow us to
bring even higher stability and
scalability of the network and reach the
sub second finality of all blocks
uh it will also help us to reduce
the gas fees at least by an order
of magnitude
uh
closer to the end of the year we will
switch to the dynamic guess
and so it will also mean that
the uh
dynamic gas rebalancing but even with
this approach so it will be much much
better than on ethereum
uh higher protocol
highest throughputs uh of course goes
without saying so we even don't cover
now so the existing throughput are never
scaled so and maybe you guys will help
us doing this uh ram protocol actually
has uh landed already and uh so now it
allows you to
uh
enjoy the guaranteed delivery of
messages within the network so uh
i'll take you guys uh we'll talk about
how
the network is functioning uh
once the low level so later
and a lot of other things actually
also what we are focusing on this year
is uh adding first of all the evm work
chain so it will allow uh existing
projects that are currently working on
other chains
to
easily hop on the error scale and
benefit from the connectivity it it
offers of course it will not be as
productive as a native ever scale but at
least it will be a transition place that
will allow you to
without any
specific upgrades of your software
easily deploy the existing contracts on
our scale directly and also the drive
chains which will offer you a very very
cheap uh storage and uh
it will help us to go further towards
the web free
approach that we are preaching so
actually uh the big idea behind
everscale is web free which is uh
make
the everscale actually a new internet so
allow you to deploy websites uh in a
decentralized way uh to access any
applications from any part of the world
so and all of this done uh securely and
and with a good speed
and drive chain is one of the uh core
pieces that you need to do this with the
chip store so it will be kind of uh ipfs
but this is a truly on on-chain stuff
um in terms of nft and gamify and
metaversion we are
focusing now to
build the sdks that will facilitate a
lot the
life of developers and help them uh
create new applications without hassle
of integration with the blockchain
thinking about the specificity of calls
and all of this
and uh this will allow to create to
create a lot of new applications and get
a new partnerships
uh as for the for the defy so actually
we have uh finished the creation of the
basic layer of the defined
infrastructure for now
and uh now we are moving to more
advanced uh protocols so uh like
derivative protocols like improved
landing borrowing protocols
and all the stuff that you can see now
in the presentation i
i just want to specifically highlight
this one uh where is my pointer
come on here it is so which is a ssi
that is currently being developed by a
team of named identics
so maybe they will also join the
hackathon
and those guys are doing
the things that will
affect the lives of each of us
so and actually this is something that
has started already in europe uh when uh
all the data controlled by you and you
can easily uh control the level of
information that you give to anyone for
example if you need to come to the
website uh that sells i don't know
alcohol so and the website requires you
to prove that you are adults so it just
needs the binary answer so yes or no and
this protocol actually having the
connection to the verified credentials
provider so actually get this answer
directly without disclosing any other
information so no more cookies no more
tracking nothing so
finally so you can benefit from
the the real privacy
and also for to
boost all this development so uh
the real novelty that was announced on
the celebration of everscales in may is
the creation of error fund so the
investment structures that will be uh
choosing uh
projects that uh go into ever skill and
bringing the value to every skill and uh
directly investing into those projects
and helping them developed with a
networking with a pr resource and a lot
of stuff so if you have good ideas and
you have a lot of uh
things that you can bring to every scale
so this is definitely the place for you
to go
um so that's pretty easy time i hope
that you didn't sleep i didn't fall
asleep this morning so uh and this is of
course the peak of iceberg and uh i can
talk about our scale for hours and uh
but this presentation was to give you
the uh
oversight what's going on and whatever
skill is about
uh so now we have some time for other
for questions so please uh feel free to
raise your hands and and task anything
about everscale so if i can i can answer
okay
so one second
for people to hear you
so
someone from our discord community with
the nickname uh
grind and find okay ask the question any
plans for the decentralized messengers
on a protocol
yeah actually so we have uh now at least
one team that is uh building the
decentralized messaging protocol so now
recently they have
presented the mvp of the uh
kind of emails on built on never scale
so and
the proof of concept
went very well
uh but the ambition is to create the
universal protocol uh
that covers all kinds of messaging
including the instant messaging
including the audio and video streams
and all that kind of stuff
they should have been speaking here to
today with us but unfortunately
the main speaker felt sick so i i hope
he will recover soon uh so but maybe for
next uh hackathon or maybe for an m
session so he will come to tell more
about this
okay
okay guys uh so if you uh are shy to ask
questions directly now so you can always
come to me and ask privately so i'm here
all the day
uh so and now i'm i give the floor to
the next speaker so to brian who is our
uh community manager
uh
so
okay so he needs five or more minutes
okay so um in this case so let's make a
short coffee break now uh just for five
minutes for brian to prepare and so we
will move on
thank you
[Applause]
um
hello guys so we continue uh please get
back to your seats and
we have our next speaker uh ready
so please meet gr brian so he is a
master of the world for broxus and also
he is our community manager so he will
tell you about uh what actually broxus
is and about its products what we are
doing so and how
all this stuff works
yeah uh first off thank you vlad
o captain our captain uh he's our
fearless leader and uh we've done a lot
over the past i've been working at boxes
for about a year and a half
and we've been able to achieve a lot and
it wouldn't have been possible without
vlad and a lot of the other team members
that we have here so
it's great seeing familiar faces and
it's also great seeing some new faces as
well
um just in lieu of an introduction i
want to
talk a bit about
this event uh this is an important day
an important weekend for all of us um
our first hackathon um as the bronx's
team and our first real conference type
event uh and so we chose elysium uh when
we were talking about
um how we wanted to theme this uh this
hackathon we thought it would be great
to
uh involve some kind of roman theme
considering that uh serbia is kind of a
cradle of a lot of uh roman empire
emperors
um and there's a uh the the aeneid um
which is a book about the founding of
rome
uh
in that in the enid uh aeneas the hero
of the journey he has to go to the
underworld to talk to his father before
he's allowed to actually get to italy uh
as and as part of that journey
he goes to the underworld and his father
shows him
all the future heroes of rome
um
so the idea kind of
philosophically about this hackathon is
that we are looking to find and identify
the future heroes of broxas and the
future heroes of the everscale network
um because we all believe in in where
we're going we're proud of what we've
done
and uh we're excited to bring more
people into the fold more people who
believe in web3 more people who believe
in defy
and have and defy as a means of um
ameliorating a lot of the problems in
the world a lot of the financial
problems in the world the imbalances and
what have you
um so without further ado let's get
started talking about uh
the biggest platforms that we have our
constellation of d5 platforms that
have really made a big impact in the
everscale ecosystem but also in d5 as a
whole
uh i feel like and i feel like a lot of
us feel that uh these platforms are are
benchmark platforms
um and one of the key things i mean in
in my uh personal experience i've
followed a bit of an errant star in my
uh career i've worked for a number of
different blockchain and cryptocurrency
projects and something that always
frustrated me was that
a lot of projects go after
they'll identify
an audience first they'll identify a a
way of making money first without
putting the work in to build that
foundation uh that foundation of solid
technology
and so what really attracted me to
proxis uh and something is that i share
with with the team and that i'm proud of
is that it's always been here it's
always been technology first you build
something that really works first and
then you move on and you tell people
about it and people are ready to believe
in you because you believe in what
you're building and what you've built
so to get started
a little bit about the broxas team
we call it a cutting edge blockchain
solution laboratory um it's about three
years old
uh we started around the same time as
everscale was launched
uh and the idea at the beginning was to
bring in the most talented people in d5
um
an emphasis on developers coders people
who can build that vision that we had
and could translate that potential that
was in d5 that so often gets missed by
other developers into something that was
practical and into something that
everybody could use because that's what
d5 was supposed to be about
uh we're going to talk i think there's
uh we've shown some slides here about
and vlad mentioned it uh p-e-t-s-d so
post-ethereum transaction stress
disorder um basically it's a it's a joke
but uh
it isn't
tenable to have very very high fees very
slow uh transaction times what we're
trying to do is make finance available
to everybody so
if finance if defy is only going to be
available available to very wealthy
people it's just not going to work
the way that this is possible is because
it's built on the everscale network
which vlad just talked at length about
um so given that everscale is the flash
is the fastest blockchain
around
and can scale toward uh to fit any
project
um that makes it that gave us the
technological foundation to do what we
wanted to do with um with these
different with our our dex platform with
our bridge platform with our wallet and
with all the other platforms that we
build wouldn't have been possible
without that underlying solidity that
underlying basis
so a bit about our philosophy i just
kind of mentioned this but um
we're committed to to transparency
decentralization
and
creating solutions that are efficient
that are easy to understand that are
sustainable and that anybody can use
um and in the end where we're going is
uh we we said the first slide says web 3
is not not as far away as you think um
yeah that's that's what we're aiming at
web 3 complete web 3
and not just for
technically savvy people but for
everybody because it's something that
the that the world definitely needs
right now if we think back to when uh
bitcoin itself was founded it was
founded on the heels of the 2008 um
recession um
and so i feel like i think a lot of
people feel that uh there are a lot of
companies in the space that have kind of
lost their focus on that original
promise um that was here in this space
and one of the great things about brox's
at least from my perspective is that
we've never lost that focus
and so i found that inspiring
so our big platforms this is the
constellation of uh of
our
flagship platforms first is access
bridge
vlad talked a bit about access bridge
it's a unique platform uh
people who use it
they're all uh i mean we've we've grown
a solid user base based on how efficient
how easy it is to use and the problems
that that it solves so vlad talked about
um
the the problems with defy the the uh
trilemma right so what's the trilemma
trilemma is that a d5 platform can't be
all three things that it needs to be
right it has to be scalable it has to be
secure
and what was the what's the third thing
decentralized right yeah so scalable
decentralized and secure most platforms
can accomplish two of those things but
uh
up until now essentially there hasn't
been a platform that's been able to
solve all three you can be scalable
and secure but you can't be
decentralized or you can be one uh two
of the others and not one of the the
remaining one
so to start with octus bridge
basically what it does as vlad explained
it does uh crosstalk cross chain
transfers for people and applications
yeah oh so yeah so
the bridge token price is just dollars
total value uh value locked in is 75.12
million um sorry about that octus is a
cross-train solution that allows you to
work not only on the token level but
also with arbitrary data and smart
contract callouts um basically what that
means is that the everyday user can use
it right but then also and it's an ideal
solution just like uh the everest
everscale network is scalable to any
kind of project you're running this too
is scalable to uh in the sense that it
it fits the needs of the individual user
but also these bigger projects and the
way that that works is because it is
truly decentralized
it's organized and governed by a dow
it's rocket fast
it's
as vlad was explaining we've had uh
we've done tests where where we've
proved that everscale is the fastest
network in the industry it's almost free
transactions i believe are
uh 0.0 um
i think it's it's less than a penny so a
fifth of a penny uh
multi-network um so the big the big
feature here is that it is connected to
some of the uh
the biggest networks in um in
cryptocurrency and in d5
and then it's scalable obviously
which allows us to not only um
have all the network networks we have
now but we're also working on bringing
in more
um so we're still pretty much at the
early stages in this in this project we
already have a big user base
you can uh check out the numbers here
um 27 relayers so the relayers are those
who verify the transactions
they're all spread out in different
locations around the world and we also
have security protocols in place
if they
were to
do something that
was against
the broxas or everscale philosophy
they could be slashed the rewards taken
away and etc
so ultimate network interop
interoperability for your blockchain
ecosystem
a lot of a lot of these projects uh
that
come out right away uh let's say you're
you're on a smaller blockchain like um
like near uh relatively smaller
blockchain like near um and you're just
launching out as a project near is a is
a chain that we're going to be adding
soon um it can be very difficult to get
the liquidity you need uh for in order
for your your
your startup or your your project to
take off uh and reach other users and
function in the way it was designed
with the octus bridge it opens up a very
easy way to transfer liquidity at a very
low price and very quickly so that
solves that problem
expansion
in a similar note
this is a gateway to all these other
blockchains
payments you can accept payments from
one blockchain to another
and in a convenient way
i mean if you want to do this without a
platform like this you're going to have
to go through five or six gateways that
you have to pay here here here you
paying along the way super inconvenient
and not practical
um invisible
upper ability uh so
we have another slide that's coming up
so i'll talk a bit more about it then
but basically it's the idea that we just
have one innervate interface the
octus bridge interface um or you can
take the api and put it into your own
platform
and have your own single interface but
it takes care of everything behind the
scenes
and you can just transfer whatever coin
you want to add
and then
a swap pair will be added to to octus
bridge and um everything is taken care
of so it makes it much easier
both for the user and for the bigger
platform
uh and be part of the story this is a
call out to you guys uh as people who
are going to be working on different
platforms on um
on everscale with broxas
this is the chance we're on the verge of
of going
very far in this industry uh and so now
is now is the time to to make your mark
here um to contribute to
decentralization to contribute to web
three
uh and to contribute to a team that uh
has very very high sites
so architecture and security um
obviously this is part of the the web 3
dilemma and so this is something that we
we've taken seriously since day one
the
architecture is comprised of all the
best uh solutions that are currently out
on the market
we've looked through everything and we
we pull together uh the best practices
um those include audited urine vault
contracts
that are used to manage liquidity
and then
we have
checked
the contracts with the nil foundation
team which vlad talked about as well
to make sure that they are reliable they
won't fail um security we brought people
in uh to audit um all of our platforms
uh the octus bridge has been through a
number of audits and uh we've also
looked around the industry to um i'm
sure all of you are aware that
there are a lot of problems that happen
in d5 platform fails people lose money
everything like that so
one of the key things key parts of our
research was studying these platforms
how they failed where the vulnerability
was and putting in preemptive measures
so it wouldn't happen with us
safety our storage contracts have built
in tools in order to prevent withdrawals
that will deviate from the average
plus we have guardians in place so
guardians are people who are monitoring
the transactions that happen on the
bridge
and so if they'll see something unusual
they'll flag it and they'll
check it out to make sure everything is
okay
invisible bridge technology so i touched
on this before but essentially
the underlying mechanism will allow any
project to send liquidity from any
connected blockchain to the bridge
so these tokens can be transferred to
the bridge and automatically added along
with additional swapping pairs
we've just added another update to the
bridge that has brought in
all the biggest token lists from
the most popular
dexes
uh and blockchains and uh allowed bridge
users to transfer them among all the
different connected uh bridges so it's a
very cool feature if you guys haven't
checked it out i recommend you you do so
relayers we talked about this before so
i'm not going to dwell on this but
they're spread out around the world
these
this is part of that that
decentralization thing which is very
important to us so not only do we have
relayers that are separated um
in different geographical locations and
disconnected from each other
but we also have a backup system that
checks to make sure that these
relayers are not acting in bad faith and
if they are acting in bad faith uh
they'll be slashed and there will be
repercussions for it um eventually we're
gonna have uh we're gonna have more than
100 relayers right but
uh there will only be 100 relayers that
will be able to verify these
transactions at a time
which actually improves the security
because it randomizes it a bit
and doesn't give power more power to
a specific relay or a specific
individual
there you can see the uh the currently
connected blockchains obviously uh
everscale is one of them as well so
we have seven right now and then we're
we are in the process of adding solana
and near um two other very very large
uh blockchains um and you look at all
the different projects there solana near
solana especially is one of the bigger
nft
so
this is going to open up a lot of doors
a lot of different possibilities for
for everscale
and for broxas because
that will bring in
um it's diffic it can be difficult uh to
do to create nfts launch nfts uh launch
gamify projects on platforms that are
not equipped to handle the huge load
that that kind of thing brings in like a
game
is uh that carries a huge load with it
everscale is is the network that can
actually handle these things and so once
we've opened these gateways to these
other networks it'll it'll uh
inspire an influx of new users to to
ever scale
so the tokenomics here
distribution we've got 65 percent uh of
the bridge token
in farming for four years
twelve percent it goes the roxas team
eleven percent is under the everscale d5
alliance
and there's a twelve percent uh pre-sale
um the bridge token itself that is
uh what enables the dow to work so
with the bridge token you stake a
certain amount of it you can become a
relayer you stake a different amount
that's the maximum but if you stick a
different amount you'll be able to
participate in
in voting on different proposals on the
the bridge platform um and so that's
important too uh we want um this
platform to
reflect what the industry actually needs
and so the only way to really do that is
to make it actually decentralized and
give people everyday people the chance
to
influence how this
platform's going to work what what needs
it's going to meet for users and
where they want it to go in the future
uh like for example what network they'd
like to see next added
rewards
the changing of farming speeds all that
kind of stuff
so here's a qr code
to take you to the actus bridge if
you're interested
give it a scan
this is also going to be up on the
discord as vlad mentioned so you'll have
a chance to check it out there
a road map
quarter three of this year where uh
we're going to be adding solana
quarter four near
um
the first quarter next year we're doing
the b2 uh b2b referral system then an
nft bridge
b2c referral system and then cross chain
oracles similar to what
chain link does
but this is all going to
make the platform much more formidable
but also bring in a lot of new people
not a lot of new users
all right so next is flat cube our decks
flat cube uh it's the biggest the
premiere decks on the everscale
blockchain
we've got over uh
over 80 80
different tokens that you can exchange
there
and it was built by taking all the all
the best features of these bigger um
dexes like uniswap
uh and bringing them into um into
everscale where they can really flourish
um along with
the same thing goes for for flat cube uh
that goes for
uh the octus bridge in terms of how fast
it is
um how easy it is to use
um and then also we have a ton of
farming and staking opportunities with
really high aprs
that have helped us build up a really
solid user base of people who are
passionate about using it and who
believe in it uh in the long term
so the basic function is asset swap
cross pair swaps and multi-sig support
um in figures like i said over 80 we had
24 hour hour volume is two and a half
million transaction speed less than two
seconds so i challenge you guys to find
uh find a dex that has a faster one and
then transaction cost is all right so
it's uh
three cents i believe
swapping is very easy
i'm sure some of you have used it before
but all you have to do is connect your
wallet select a token select an amount
and then just make a swap
the thing that you need on our end to
use it is the everwallet and that's
going to be the next thing i cover but
one of the key parts of the flat cube
decks is the wrapped ever token so
wrapped ever allows
us to interact with tokens from other
networks on on this dex decks
and it's
made with a
tip 3.1 token standard
and it's it can be exchanged one for one
with uh with ever it's a very easy
process of exchanging it and once you do
that you'll open up all the
possibilities that the dex has to offer
the problems that we see the problems
that we see this is this is referring to
other dexes on the market right so
current market problems um
a lot of miners and mining pools can
obtain obtain previews of transactions
while confirming and validating them on
decentralized exchanges that kind of
violates the whole idea of
decentralization
we don't need the miners and
mining pools shouldn't have uh
a strong grip on power they shouldn't
have that much of a grip on power
true decentralization
it's very hard to come by in d5
a bit of an oxymoron but uh
everyone's still striving for that that
true decentralization uh but the way
that a lot of these platforms are set up
they're not actually decentralized
and then of course transaction speed and
fees
so there nobody's got us beat
this is just an example this is uh
this is what gives people p e t s d
so you look at the low
gas fee it's over 200
average 222 high 222. that's not i mean
if
the way that d5 is talked about
it's a replacement for this out-of-date
banking system that's not a replacement
for any kind of banking system that's
something that's not sustainable
on everscale it's
200 less so
that's something that people can
actually work with
so our solution flat cube
total value uh locked into the platform
of assets is over 3 33 million
token payers 83 farming pools 15 plus
volume over the past 24 hours is uh
close to 3 million
and then the highest apr we got is uh
uh most recently 113 percent um which is
huge uh
so
we've got over uh true 200 validators um
and these are our different uh
our different partnerships and where
we've been covered in the media
and
these are our different uh communities
our social media pages that you guys can
can check out for more information but
that's where you'll find all the latest
updates from from us
privacy and reliability
so there's no registration no kyc you
don't have to jump through hoops like
you would with a lot of other exchanges
no front runs
the way that everscale was designed it
makes front runs impossible so uh
collusion between miners that kind of
thing um
that that's not a possibility
which is a great thing
uh no cookies so
we're very much
on the side of uh
the privacy of the individual
so you don't have to worry about us
tracking your data or selling it to
someone else it's all safe there tested
and trusted it's open source so
if you don't believe it head to our git
book and our github and
check out check out the code and
everything for yourself
we have faith in it and that's why we
make it open source and not a lot of
people do so
in terms of the auditing we've been
audited a number of times um and that's
uh something that still goes on because
it you know you don't just get audited
once you don't get um
checked once as the platform evolves as
as we get more people we have to be to
know that we can handle um the bigger
workload and so that's a constant
process
but that's something that we do
regularly knowledgehub
so for our newcomers
as i said before we're trying to make
this as easy for people as possible so
that the the average person who doesn't
know much at all about um cryptocurrency
or defy they can just go and kind of
intuitively understand how to use the
the platform
in addition to that we've written a
number of different materials um guides
we've made videos uh all explaining how
this works and all trying to smooth
smooth out the process of people
onboarding onto the platform and
realizing how they can use it to their
benefit
so this is a breakdown of the dex yield
farming
total figures total
value locked in is over 33 million we've
got over 15
farming pools uh the apr rates are
they're a bit out of date here um but
they're still very high
uh and this was um i think taken a
couple maybe a month ago or so so some
of the statistics here are are out of
date a little bit but this does give a
good uh representation of the
opportunities that are there uh the the
farming opportunities are very very
healthy the pools are very healthy we
have a lot of people participating in it
um and then they get rewards
in uh through our vesting system
so
for those looking i feel like people are
always looking for
the new the most advantageous place to
to participate in yield farming because
rates change all the time this flat cube
is still among the best in the industry
in terms of what the way you're going to
get rewarded monetarily but also the
safety that comes with it
so flat cube decks token and farming
program builders um
what what this means what this refers to
is that uh
users can create their own tokens
and organize swaps with other assets
and then also create their own farming
pools
so this is a very cool decentralized
idea puts power in the people's hands
they
this kind of opens the door for
community
induced growth um and for
uh the platform to better reflect the
wishes of the community if there's a a
coin that someone wants to add there um
it's all possible uh and that's thanks
to the dow and thanks to the way this
was set up
so we also have a dex api
which will allow other platforms to
integrate our decks into their um into
their platform
it's super easy
here we've got if you follow the qr code
it'll take you to dexata.io which is a
collaboration with cardano where they're
using um
our flatcubedex
api to build a cross
cross-chain bridge between um cardano
and uh
and flat q and the everscale network
the cube token so the cube token is what
uh facilitates the uh the dow that
governs the flat cube platform
there are special rewards when you stake
cube to boost your regular farming
returns
um
using cube allows you to get the the
most out of yield farming using cube
also
because it is the way that you
participate in the dow
that allows you to influence
how the the platform is going to change
if you want to see a change or if
someone else brings a proposal that you
agree with you stake your cube you vote
on it and then the platform can change
if it gets enough uh get enough votes
um
then you can also stake your cube to to
get rewards uh you're rewarded for
boosting the liquidity of the platform
uh so and up here you can see the uh the
initial
distribution of the cube token and then
the dow monthly emissions um this stuff
you can check out uh on your own i don't
want to bore you too much with it uh but
we have a healthy amount distributed to
farming and another healthy amount
distributed to liquidity um and those
are very important for the the long term
the longevity of the platform uh in
order to keep these farming pools as
healthy as possible
cube token price chart so this was taken
i think
about a month ago as well
the price is down as prices are down
across the whole industry but
you can this gives a good idea of um
of the growth that it experienced uh
while while not being uh listed on uh
major exchanges this is like all organic
growth um there's a definitive utility
in the token um and a utility that
people have recognized and are trying to
capitalize on um so this is just the
beginning these listings are going to
come soon um we're still moving forward
at a very fast pace so
there's going to be more to be said on
this front
here's a qr code to check out flat cube
if you are of the mind to do so now um
if not definitely check it out later
and a road map so uh quarter three of
this year um we're going to introduce
cube staking the dow is going to be
fully developed fully launched uh
for the next quarter we'll have gouges
listing for v cube
uh the next the first quarter of the
next year boosted farming custom white
lists uh then limit orders cube buyback
and burn cross-chain swaps and marginal
trading so these are some really big
things that are going to change the
platform add a lot of new possibilities
there so
we have a lot to look forward to
now everwallet uh this is the skeleton
key to the everscale ecosystem
by that
it means that it opens all the doors all
the different platforms uh that operate
on everscale uh the everwall is your
essentially your passport to use these
things um
and to take full advantage of everything
that we have going on here
so it's the premier wallet for the
everscale blockchain it's not the only
wallet but it's the one that
accomplishes the most um
you can uh
do fast transactions with minimal fees
and access to all the the apps in the uh
in the everscale ecosystem just in one
application um it works on uh
mobile desktop etc uh i think uh
everyone that uses it finds it very
comfortable and very versatile
and we've we've had more than uh 35 000
installs and that's organic installs so
um this thing uh it's not being pushed
as this new platform this is people have
recognized the need for it
by using other
dapps on the on the everscale network uh
and
this is yeah so that's a that's a very
uh significant number and something that
um i think is indicative of a positive
trend that's going to continue
as this as our
products continue to grow broxx's
products continue to grow but also the
everscale network continues to branch
out
and penetrate into different markets in
the world so
fast and easy access to your assets
it's available on all your devices you
get multi-sig wallets
rocket fast it works with ledger has hd
wallet technology secure and par and
private
a huge part of the ecosystem
um external dap compatible
we're going to bring out nft support
with it soon that's something vlad was
talking about uh where we are working on
uh on developing our nft offerings and
um
obviously the the everwall is going to
be key to allowing that to happen and
then also uh another big thing we're
working on is allowing uh bank card
credit card uh purchases forever to make
it that much easier to to buy it
in just in your in your wallet
for developers uh we've got a in-page
provider
so this is a web3-like interface forever
scale provided by the ever wallet
browser extension
and with this you'll be able to do a
number of different things including
packing and unpacking cells decoding
transactions events messages local
execution of messages sending internal
and external messages and then
subscriptions to contacts state contract
states and transactions and and there's
a lot more so if you are a
developer this is something and you're
when you you're looking for
to try and integrate this to your
platform this is something you should
definitely check out
now and last but not least uh our team
um we got the founder sergey
uh vlad our captain uh and then the rest
of these guys stars i believe sergey is
going to be
giving a speech later and
a few i think there might be another
another person giving a speech
but anyway
these people the whole team is spread
out all over uh all over the world i'm
from america
we've all been brought together by
sharing sharing a common vision
obviously having experience having
know-how
everybody i feel confident in saying
that everybody i work with is not only
passionate about what they do but
they're they're competent they know
exactly what needs to be done and how to
do it and if there are questions we've
got leaders that help us through the
process so uh it's been a pleasure for
me to work here for over a year and i
hope that that
our great relationship continues moving
forward
thank you uh this is a qr code to our
discord server where
we have our most uh you'll you get all
the news there but also we have a pretty
active community that's that chats they
make memes that are pretty funny um so
definitely check it out if you get a
chance but thank you guys
[Applause]
hello
thank you brian so excellent speech uh
actually guys so i i really encourage
you to add to all this code server
because uh all the main communication
about the hackathon will be going on
there
and uh also please do not hesitate to
contact any of the personnel here just
to add you to the group of hackathon
to meet with your mentor so to discuss
with
other participants to form your teams
and all that kind of stuff
uh so we just a kind reminder so we are
planning to
finish forming teams by uh 5 p.m bill
great time today uh so please add at
least a couple of hours before so right
now
uh yeah so uh i was thought there are
some questions uh actually um
yeah on this course so uh brian can you
maybe read them out yeah yeah can you
show me
so outside of the well uh known wallet
decks and bridge platform that you guys
have created what other projects um does
everscale i think he means boxes what
other projects does broxus work on
yeah actually i slightly touched this
before so uh besides broxah there are
quite a number of other contributors who
are doing uh
the stuff
so uh not to name everex who is doing
the
all the basic layer of infrastructure
like node software and
different libraries for developers they
also develop in the flex they would
order book based recently uh you may
have seen that docker uh has announced a
partnership with overscale in terms of
gauche which is a decentralized git uh
actually built on the replica of
everscale network
we have
some games going on here some like the
race like pile blocks like pokertown
street bosses
and a lot of others so there are quite a
lot of casual games going on now
uh we have a number of ft marketplaces
so developed by it gold team and
a number of others so well just id gold
uh as the biggest so but there are quite
a lot of more niche
marketplaces
um
quite quite a number of stuff is going
on actually so there
and then uh there's been a lot of talk
about how well suited everscale is for
gamify and metaverse projects why is
that the case what makes everscale the
ideal blockchain for those kinds of
projects um actually uh the answer is
just if you have a look at the recent uh
incidents that networks experienced with
launching such a gamified project like
steppen uh or before cryptokitties if
you remember it so what went uh
not really well for ethereum uh so
actually every scale thanks to infinite
sharding so it's capable uh to scale uh
momentarily to withstand the workload
that it's required
and currently so uh
no game has generated the workload
that's never scale is not capable to to
do with
yeah i would just add uh i mean people
talk about uh or have talked about
solana as the ethereum killer or as the
solution to ethereum um because it was
going to be able to handle more uh
transactions a higher load but then uh
people started migrating to solana and
solana's down all the time now so uh it
doesn't really work out um that way uh
that i don't think they're capable of
taking on not just them but a lot of
these networks are not capable of taking
on that kind of load because they're not
built the same way but
um
can you list three killer features of
your project that make it ahead of
competitors what are the competitive
advantage that you feel most confident
about
um
i would say maybe it's it's not
something sericular features so actually
this is the whole philosophy that we
preach and so we first really uh well
study what people need so we uh take
careful uh
customer research and look what other
others are doing so what challenges
they're facing
uh after that we think
so uh think of how we can uh overcome
those limitations that are causing the
problems now and
also we think about the problems that
may arise in future so uh just to give
you an example so as a recent you may
have seen so i also highlighted in my
twitter thread
um that uh a number of hacks of d5
platforms has drastically increased over
over the last uh few months so and the
first uh obvious target for them are
bridges because uh bridges contain a lot
of liquidity on the walls
and uh they are
such
really rich targets for hackers
but
in the architectures that we are
developing security is on the first
place actually so when we try to think
of any possible scenario how the hacker
can
try to break in into the bridge and how
we will make the funds secure
so and that's pretty pretty much
the approach as we preach across all of
our development the first try to think a
few steps ahead
before we're doing something so we make
the reliable systems and uh they may not
be the fastest in development like us
because a lot of projects are doing
faster
that's true but
then they suffer so and
we are developing on a bit slower pace
but we're trying to build solutions that
uh are really really uh expensive to
hack so
no reason to do this
do you have any plans to migrate uh to
other chains
um
probably the question is about adding
new chains yeah i think uh
yeah so we have actually plans and uh
the commercial strategy for the octus
bridge for example is adding the most
valuable chains uh to connect between
each other so there is absolutely no
reason for us to
roll up to i don't know some minor chain
where there are no developers no
development activity and those ones were
selected uh actually because they had a
lot of developer activity going on a lot
of liquidity a lot of interesting
projects that uh
sooner or later phase limitation of the
homegrown network and then they need to
scale to other audiences so and so forth
and as i showed uh on the slides uh
devoted to uh connectivity and to cross
chain actually i strongly believe that
the cross chain is the future because uh
of course there is always a preference
for developers so some someone likes
rust someone likes solidity someone
likes ethereum another one like sneer
but in general so if they find the uh
fit between the
the the proposals that they are doing
and the customer needs uh sooner or
later they will need to grow and they
will be standing actually and um
the architecture of october's bridge
allows to deploy the bridge in a new uh
evm network within a day
but there's absolutely no reason for us
to do this until we fully cover all
those networks that's already in place
no more no more uh
when will we integrate oh uh when will
you integrate nft um nfts to your ever
wallet
uh it's currently in progress so um
within a couple of months i think
so uh actually this is something
what
metamask did so when a lot of our
customers were asking us to add a
display of nfts but the main
reason why it took so long uh here is
because
our wallet now is infrastructure product
actually so it's not a customer product
uh
this and uh we need to think
a bit uh far far beyond uh
of what will be going on and what how
the our wallet will be evolving actually
and uh nft displaying uh
is just one of the features that uh
constantly added to the error wallet so
also we will we have the network scanner
called everscan so everscan.yeah
it will also contain
the possibility of viewing nfts and not
only pictures contained in nfts but
as i said so all the other stuff like
metaverse regions
inventory
i don't know what else so a lot of stuff
so as it will be that
um another question sorry i'm new to the
ever to ever scale
uh like sorry
no welcome uh daniel um what is the
benefit for me to become a relayer
uh
relayer is uh okay so
on never scale so uh you have validators
so validator gets the reward
for validating the network obviously so
it's something like gives you
annualized something like 11 percent
or so
and uh for october's breach so we also
have those validators sculpture layers
so actually real layers and it's very
important to look into the tokenomics of
the bridge in this case our layers get
the half of all the rewards that bridge
has generated
and as the layer number is limited so uh
you can imagine that they're
making uh much more money than the
regularistic stakeholder although you
can use your bridge tokens to stake
on the bridge to get a part of reward
so but to be relayer it's it's quite
expensive so it's a hundred thousand uh
bridge tokens which is uh something like
half a million dollars uh nowadays and
uh
that's why we are carefully selecting
the layers
that will add not only money but also
the value and the reputation to the
bridge itself
that's why we are constantly in in a
discussion with big liquidity providers
with a
big and noticeable market players so who
will be happy to see on the list
but also relayer is a great
responsibility and you really need to
take uh to make sure that you have that
your hardware to run the re-layer
and good internet connection
yeah so
for you uh for for error layer so it's
of course not only about being
money generating stream but it's also
about the reputation so because we
position bridge as a really secure
cross-chain transfer uh
tool
everscale is cool but not uh still not
well-known blockchain so how do you plan
to get more exposure
actually that's what i said
so we have started the
first
massive marketing campaigns in asia
somewhat end of next year so it's only a
few months have passed but we already
see a lot of gaining gaining from that
region a lot of grossing in the
community
uh so and in asian regions so we focus
now on south korea and indonesia but we
haven't planned
additional marketing campaigns in japan
and
malaysia
and also planning to expand furthermore
across the world so now we are testing a
lot of different hypotheses uh the
product fits
so try to look into the messages that
are really appealing to people
especially nowadays during the crypto
winter when everyone is down so
everybody's set so we need to somehow
find
this right words for people
um next question uh what are
cross chain oracles
crossing oracles is
a concept that we are currently uh
developing so it's it's in r d stage
um actually what uh
bridge does so it actually listens all
the networks that it's connected to and
this way uh layer nodes can also operate
like oracles
because you can subscribe to certain
data that you need to transfer
to get from different chains and this
way
bridge serves as a
ultimate decentralized oracle
but
as we clearly understand how much
responsibility it will
put on us
we first want to
carefully
look into how everything works for
example in chain link and all the other
oracles
and
propose the system that will
deliver the reliable on chain data for
the needs not only of users but also for
the apps and uh different smart
contracts applications and
this is not an easy task but
we it's
prioritizing our roadmap so i hope that
we'll see some kind of mvp
this year
are there any more
questions
i don't
know
um so uh someone has asked uh vlad if
you could give us an update on any uh
road map achievements
uh yeah uh actually really
not not not long ago so we have released
one of the biggest
updates for the breach recently it's
called the merge
and what it does so it's works in
junction with a
universal bridge technology so universal
bridge lets you uh transfer any token to
any other network for example if you
have a token on i don't know an
avalanche and you need to get it on bnb
uh so you can uh already now transfer it
without any limitation meaning that we
support all tokens
uh but you will get the
robbed token with a prefix oct
for octus
in the target network and for just
imagine if you have uh your own tokens
already on different networks um
and you want
them to easily convert to one another so
that's where the merged technology uh
comes in place so it allows you to
indicate the specific uh tokens in
different networks that are basically
the same so for example if you have
tether
on ethereum and on solana uh so this is
pretty much the same tether yeah so just
of course there are some peculiarities
but basically this is the same
entity issuing it and uh
you want to indicate that it is the same
token and in this case um it works a bit
differently so uh for universal bridge
tokens so how it works you actually have
the one input stream so with your tokens
that are
put on the world in one network and then
it is a bridge who controls the emission
of this derivative some other tokens so
on the other network
but for the merge tokens so actually
there is a new configuration in it that
indicates the link between tokens and
now you will be able to uh
withdraw tokens on the target network
only if they are contained in that world
at the end of the line
and this technology is is really
interesting and cool because uh it will
allow uh projects actually to control
the emission from one place
for example if you have
some
some dao
deployed in in any other network so that
is controlling the
the token so you can issue enough tokens
and rebalance them between networks
uh
there is a new feature coming soon so uh
we have quite a lot of updates coming uh
with the pro prominence solana
integration um so um
if we uh
get on time so uh we will also add the
possibility to uh universal uh smart
calls transferred between any other
chain so meaning that you can call on 1d
app in one chain the smart contract in
total another chain so it creates such a
tremendous amount of opportunities for
you
i'm not sure if it will release in this
specific release but it will definitely
come
and of
course we
are constantly working on improving the
security so and uh
there are quite a lot of improvements
that
are not
well
interesting for a common user but
they are sounds really
important for developers
so uh
we have also recently uh
added
a whole bunch of documentation
about the octus bridge to make it easier
to integrate with
okay so enough walk to the bridge
for the flat cube for example we have
recently added a
stable curve
to to our decks meaning that you can now
deploy uh pool liquidity pool with a
curve pretty similar to what
curve does the girth project does so
means that you can
swap stable coins with a really slow
slippage uh almost zero um and it was
something that was so so badly needed on
the scale and now we are working also on
the triples uh
meaning that you can have liquid pools
with multiple tokens
yeah so
quite a lot is going on just keep
subscribe to social media
i think that's that's all the questions
we've got so far guys maybe you have
some questions here in the audience
offline
don't be shy please
okay uh in this case so i propose to
make
another break now uh just to have some
snacks so and uh after that so um
uh
maybe let's in half an hour so uh
we will have the start of our technical
uh presentations so uh
alex from i.t goats who will tell about
the solidity
on our scale so it's quite interesting
topic and
there is a number of there are a number
of contributors on our scale who have
wrote
an excellent guide
of how
ethereum developer can easily hop on
to our scale and also
another uh presentation
that is coming by sergei pateken who is
our lead
blockchain developer
uh is about uh how october's breach
really works and how you can integrate
with it and you can how you can benefit
from it
okay
thank you
[Applause]
yeah it's 3pm so we will have some
burgers
we are moving further so we have
alex
okay hello yes yes hello everyone my
name is alexander i am member of it goal
team
i am happy to be how i am happy to be a
part of mentors team
so
what we talk about
we talk about everscale it's a fast
cable it's very good network and it's
very young network and we will talk
about uh
develop developer experience in
everscale
we talk about most important points for
developing smart contract or for
how to interact with everscale
when you build off chain application or
web like application
so
if you worked about every skill
development
uh
maybe you listen uh everyone is a file
yes it's a unix way
in every scale we we have
our own way it's everything is smart
contract
uh what's means
you can send tokens
in every scale without smart smart
contracts i
you need to
call smart contracts if you want to
interact with the other scale
network
investigator present
multi-trading and distributed
programming features
which can help to be a fast secure and
scalability in one time
uh scale a systemic network
20 years ago
most big part of program was synchrony
clicks
what this means all program was executed
step by step and computers idle
while
while response
so
but in this time currently all program
is most threat
i think music trading it's a future for
blockchain and for every scale it's
already done
you still have dynamic sharding
it means we increase threshold count if
we have load network and merge it back
if it's done
so
next feature is severe scale it's paid
storage
uh two years ago we i have a
big problem in community it's about uh
blockchain size yeah
in this timeful note of ethereum i think
it's uh
two terabytes and
binance machine more
how to scale
sync to
not so
to be big so big it's paid storage
uh
every scale smart contracts uh pay a
rent to network
for
this site with this size
it means all this means no for example
if i want to
create tokens uh main tokens maybe in
coin and send to thousands or many
addresses i pay on the network field in
every scale i pay not only network fee i
paid storage view
it
can help to future
this mod
and it's very very important part of
every scale
we have uh
we need to have uh tokens on all smart
contracts in network
so in every scale has proof of state
validation
i think many current
many news network have proof of state
validation
ethereum will have proof of state
validation
uh it's not now but uh
it's not news but uh
uh all you know all you need to know uh
if you
have proof of state relation we don't
need to wait uh several blocks
for
fourth in the state if we see blocks its
mean state already differentiate that
so
about a smart contract
every single smart contract this means
we can
ask addresses in every scale from
explorer and
take
a state
it can be non-exist state this means
this
account or addresses it's the same
not use it
and don't not have balance not have
not have smart contract to deploy it we
can have a
unit state it means somebody maybe you
send
several error errors to this addresses
but not deployed contract to this
addresses or
maybe the status was frozen and
destroyed
so frozen
it's about paid storage if we deploy a
smart contract and don't pay it uh
fee yes and if this contract
uh this country will be freezing frozen
um
frozen contract to store
two years as i know but every scale is
new network and i know only
several cases when small contract was
frozen we cannot throw them contract we
have this procedure but
it's don't use it
often
so an active active smart contract is
one contract that we can execute
right now
so
what about asynchronic material of every
scale
it's a big part and most important part
for developers so
let's see
diagram but i see mistake in diagram but
okay so uh first part of uh execution
smart contract it's message
message at its job what we need to do in
uh
blockchain what we can't change its
message
we create matches and send to blockchain
it's external in message
all the interact with the blockchain
starts with this message
message create a transaction
it can be one transaction
for external
in message so it's transactions
transaction is its execution of this
message
uh for example you want to send coins to
another user or you want to increment
the counter its message and transaction
but
when transactions are cuted
that can be
create many different can be many
different
messages
it's not transaction it's messages
it can be zero messages or you know
hundreds messengers
messengers it's another job to in other
smart contracts it's
internal messages message messages that
are created
by transaction
so and every message
create our own transaction and own
transaction can create another message
we have a graph it's direct graph we
have a root and direction
and this graph can be
bigger
for example we tested
chains that have one million points
it's it's very long chain execution of
all of points
was more than one day it's so long
but it it was meant one million of 15 by
one messages
so uh what's the problem with this uh
shaman
uh first difficult to calculate gas fee
uh we have a long chain uh every message
hand can create another transactions
every transaction need to paid
user ever
and it was a big
big change
so
we can't calculate how many errors you
need to pay for
for full full transactions all
transactions
uh usually we use uh
usually we take more errors that i
needed that we needed because we can
prediction how many errors you can use
we can use maybe i don't know we need to
use two errors for
all chain but users send five flavors
and we
return change uh when
transaction chains is chain inspected
so
uh save a second problem uh if we have a
exception for example we create messages
that create transactions message
transactions long long away and we have
exception in the middle
i don't know we haven't got we have
exception in smart contract
what
we need to do
we can special bounce and balances
messages that
can create
full back transactions
but it's hard for development
we can use callback message
we can use many different uh
actions for for the solute for solutions
this problem but uh
but it's hard yes
i synchronics regime it's more difficult
for developing than synchronic
development
when you
uh when you deploy smart contract you
need to think how it will be
how it will be used and
what you will be do if something
wrong
so
and uh most uh i don't know
most important uh most often uh actions
that you did
and when
a smart contract
uh call another smart contract for read
his statement
variables
for example yes
you need to check
how many tokens
have
how many tokens on wallet or who is
owner of nft
if you
read
the information chain you have a
transaction to
you have transaction to nft for example
or
swap
okay you have transaction for nifty or
swap payer for get a price
and
you can you
get receive from
from
supplier isochronic six
uh
if something changed in this time
because it's async mod
you need to
think about it when you develop a smart
contract
so what about paid storage uh as i say
uh
smart contracts uh
pay a storage sphere
we can calculate how many storage fee we
will pay it one year to year or or
on different period
but
if of course if
storage speed not changed
for network
so
and when we
deploy a smart contract every time we
store a
part of adders on smart contract
addresses
for storage sphere
because storage fee
is changeable
not directly it's changeable
chargeable every time when smart
contract executed
but
good practice if you don't use the smart
contract you will destroy it and take
back
errors that stored on the smart contract
okay
i think all you need to know is this
time
when you deploy a smart contract you
need to
you need to send
a few errors i don't know
0.1 neighbors or smaller to smart
contract and
it can help to
store this contract one year and now
uh for uh
faculty members we sent sent i think how
to calculate storage team
and uh proof of state validation oh i
don't know what uh what can i say
more about proof of state
i don't
speak about proof of state and proof of
work was different
but best
best thing about proof of state it means
every scale we produce blocks every
second
and faster sometimes so it means every
second when you
take a block you know that finalization
already done
this mean you can
use that data for
for you for users
if you buy something or
you take it
when block is reduced
so
and about shutting technology
two years ago
two weeks ago we have a minimum
16 shards in mainnet
and we
down minimum shards to one
no
two year to two week goals and it uh
network
a little faster after it
but
if
if network have been cloud maybe
all of them want to
to do something in every scale
we have
active sharding technology it means
validators split a lot between
by addresses by mask
between together
and
it can help
help us
produce the block by one second
and
it's very fast so
uh okay
when we develop smart contract we need
to interact with smart contract for you
from ui ux or
something else i don't know maybe
backhand it's maybe a custodial
non-custodial services
first you need to use
everscan or airlife it's blockchain
explorers
it's a different blockchain explorers
they show one blockchain overscale but
you can see
but you can work with this
explorers use a different protocol for
everscan it's rest type it's work fast
and simple and for every life is graphql
use graphql you can take more
information but
as a graph of data
but it's not needed uh often
and you can use
products that you that you want
so and for ever scan we have a special
path for
token players as as i know and
another information about
tokens
so
every live present information about
blocks transaction accounts
and and other but how to interact with
this blockchain you need to
get account data from blockchain
but
you can't read uh account fields here
from account in smart contract you can
read uh smart contracts fields
microcontroller state from uh
from everest or real life you can only
read account state
for
use account state you can
you need to own
you need to use the card yes it's
averaged
provider but i need to take back
okay what about data structure structure
in either scale
in the first case you need to use the
messages
have a
we have
external messages is its message that
produces user to smart contract from
external world
we have internal messages message its
job
that one smart smart contract send to
another smart contract it's interact
interaction with a between smart
contract
and we have external out messages it's
like a log in ethereum
so
external out messages produced smart
contract but we
don't have this nation
so
when we use messages so when if you want
to change something in your scale you
create external in messages
um you can
read the eternal messages or
but usually don't need it i don't know
no usually it's not needed
accounts search wallets
accounts it's smart contract
you you can uh
if you will read documentation you can
read accounts you can read smart
contracts it's the same
uh
all interaction with smart contract
uh started usually from wallets
as i say uh
everything is smart contract you can
send errors without a vote
and vote is smart contract
and
i think 90 percent of user either scale
have multisig wallet because it's a
standard wallet for every scale
and it's it's good because
we can
update
wallet user can update
your own voters for
other custodials either the
new case or change case it's more
security
no but i think
90 persons world have won only one
custodial
so uh
if i want to interact with blockchain i
need to send message to vote
and vote
approximate this matrix
and send volt in cent errors
with payload to
two smart contract
usually
usually this message it measures two
volt user
and these transactions have
errors and have this nation another
small contract for example you want to
change
you evers to
uh
i don't know two
years
two tokens for example you send errors
you you send message to your vault
and vault uh processing this message to
a swap contract
and vote added
some errors for example five flavors for
gas fee
as asgas team
and take it back
when transaction is finished
okay
transactions
as i say transactions is a
fact of executions of messages all
transaction has methods that
produce this transaction and
out message that created
in transactions it can be zero messages
out messages or you know
or many message out outs and blocks all
messages transactions pack two blocks
and
i think you don't work with blocks
because it's not needed in the us in
scenario yes he's
not
if he uses decay it's hided for you
okay
for
smart contract call
i think you need to install ever wallet
yes it's uh
process
world
if you install it generate it for us
take some errors if you want to develop
needfnet you can write mentors and we
send errors for development to you add
in page provider it's
part of
developing uh ecosystem
uh you can use it for developing for
in your backend or front-end
and and
if you use uh
language uh
different language maybe
java or
i don't know rust or something else you
can use every sdk
we have binic for this decay for many
images
thanks
so much questions
okay
okay thank you alex uh guys do you have
any questions about uh
smart contract so feel free to ask alex
is a professional
he's also a developer
okay take your time so just eat you
might have covered it in your speech
just a second when were
asynchronous smart contracts first
deployed it was after
the ethereum network was released
so when when were
asynchronous
smart contracts first developed
okay if you want to develop smartcon
you need to how to deploy it or no when
when was it uh
like it's it's hard it's of course it's
uh harder than uh ethereum development
because it's uh we need to think about
all execution of smart contracts always
all exceptions
it's more harder but it's more
interesting when you when you it's like
uh it's like multi-trading development
and
synchrony developing in uh i don't know
on java.net
python and other languages
uh
yes many currently languages already
have synchronous like coroutine on some
scales every scale it's asynchronic
language
from start yes
of course you can write smart contracts
that
will work
synchronically and change only state of
this smart contractor it will work us at
anyone
but if you
create a
product a big product you need to
use main smart
check
state uh
it's it's hard yes it's harder
so was everscale the first network to be
asynchronous from the start
it's the first
i say that everscale is a good network
for start developing in isanix mode
because we have
many tips and tricks how to
how to
how to be how to create secure program
yes because if we create asynchronic uh
if if we
call smart contract inside blockchain
yes we have big chain we need to think
how to
how to make it secure when transaction
is finished uh how to beat
many many questions we have when we
program maternity and many of them
already
have already solution or
samples in every scale
for example it's uh
tip
tip 43 it's uh
ever skill standards uh
if you will work visible scale you can
read about the standards they already
have solution how to
create uc
20 tokens how to create a
nfc token endeavor scale
for scalable mod for security mode
how to
store it how to change it all of them
you know
we have solution for all of them
and so does that give developers more
flexibility with what they can do
is that why ever sk does that add to
like the scalability of everscale that
you can kind of adapt it to
to other
um
other needs i guess
what you got you need for
adapter
okay um
yeah of course we have
i say i say another of course uh you can
uh
okay we have a big task okay i have
example we have a big task yes uh in
ethereum we have uh
uh
in all of the network and every scale 2
we have a gas limit for action
yes
and it's this gas limit it's
not big because it's a part of attack to
network yes
dos attacked the network
and
when we programming tower scale in ice
chronic regime we have many small
contracts small it means they have uh
it's like uh developing in necro system
uh you have many micro system that uh
interact together that can send messages
ask the messengers that uh that store
you own data in in her state it's like
microsystem if you uh develop
microsystem uh it's the same
i think
oh no no i think it's true it's it's the
same
so uh
in this case
no uh already i say about uh mint one
million nft in every scale when from one
transaction
it's it's it's was one uh in transaction
but it's uh create one million in other
transactions that that uh executed in
blockchain
uh
it's uh
it's in and all of nft have a unique
data
for example uh you can do it in their
home
thank you yeah thank you
hello hello can you tell us some about
future evm
uh blockchain on every scale
uh how will it be inside every scale
okay we tested work chains
we have a two chain in every scale now
is master chain and work chain
but uh master chain not for
not for users because in masterchain we
have a big
gas fee for all the patients it
network for validations of course you
can use it but
i i don't think that it's
need for you
and the work chain is working zero it's
our
uh
main our main work chain when we
deploy all our small smart small
contracts
uh
in
last summer
we have
raskop it's a special event in universe
scale
with
we have another network and have 10 word
chains
all our chains can have another
different uh rules for gas sphere for
storage sphere uh
this varchan can have another rules for
for virtual machine for example one
version can have ton build tbm
and
and what you want yes we can we can have
uh up drive chain for store data for
example our way it's up another
blockchain for store uh
store uh files yes for nft and
you know
for everything
uh this version was
a high value for execution but low value
for storage uh
in this time maybe not this time maybe
next month
uh we will test that uh interaction
interaction with between the chains for
example version zero or chain one it's
different chain it can be different uh
main token
it's not like it's scalability we can
multiply if you if you want
for different case
yeah so basically uh evm workchain is
just yet another chain with its own uh
set of rules
so it will uh have the same set of raw
similar to
classic ethereum for example so it's
having the same virtual machine but
after the transactions and blocks are
issued on this worksheet so
uh the final state is written in the
master chain
so
it works pretty much like uh well polka
dot should work
so actually every scale is the
polka dot but the real one
and better we all weight it yes
but for example in this time when you
use a smart contract we have addresses
that have two parts it's
a blockchain id and address part
and when you program smart contract we
you use zero bar chaining this time but
you can
and you can set one or two over chain id
okay
okay this comes from a programmer that's
not a blockchain programmer but um
because we're using asynchronous
computing here is there a hazard for
a double spending thing and if that
happens how do uh
the validators how do they act when
something like that happens you know
because you have errors non-stop who
actually pays that fee and something
like that happens and it's been written
on the blockchain already uh how do we
track back to that and actually
uh make sure that everything is all
right
okay well double spending
uh double spending attack hits attack
when we
produce
one message twice and the
user paid twice uh augustine or
users that send twice
user
execute twice one operation for av scale
if we talk about programming yes we have
a pragma time
it means
message that user sign
will be executed only one time
so if we use this pragma if we don't use
the magma
we have a problem but
yeah yeah
i was asking because you know uh that
would actually take time for validators
and that would impact performance of the
network you know so that because it has
to be rechecked or uh who will actually
have to pay that fee because p is very
cheap but still you know
there is more
more than one you would actually have to
process it yeah
okay maybe
okay we have a ram protocol
it's
already tested on uh
on the felder network or will be tested
a in
uh it's already on in main ideas uh all
messengers have a
unique id
and will be
produced by logical time
okay thank you good questions
anything else guys
don't hesitate to ask
no really
come on i see you want to ask something
okay
so do we have some online questions
no okay uh thank you alex uh excellent
presentation uh so guys and uh again so
for those who are flying
on in the belgrade and uh or online
looking for the stream don't hesitate to
ask questions again come to our discord
uh so you see the qr code on the screen
and
so there's also always someone who can
help you to answer any any question
about everscale and programming on it
okay uh so we uh in five minutes we will
have our next speaker uh so
let's make a short coffee break and
come back in 5-10 minutes thank you
okay guys we're ready to continue so
please take your seats uh
those who are here offline take your
chairs and those who are off online
please get back to your monitor or cell
phone uh so uh now we will have sergey
patakin who is the lead blockchain
developer uh in brooksus uh so he will
tell us about uh the architecture of the
octus bridge and the way how you can
integrate and benefit from it
guys can you put sergey on screen please
this is the presentation but don't see
sergey
so you say something
yes one two three one okay we hear you
perfect
okay we here but we don't see you
for some reason
uh
i don't know what to say on the live
stream we see you see okay
uh so the floor is yours please
enjoy
uh yes
okay so let's move on uh thank you vlad
uh yeah my name is uh sergey i am the
team lead in boxes even though i don't
have this beautiful t-shirt
uh so uh
i'm gonna tell you a little uh technical
information about the octus bridge
my
slides are called coctus bridge
so it's
more even about the workshop than the
lecture
uh i want to
tell you about the doctor's bridge
architecture about the smart contracts
so it's a technical talk
and
my my my main goal is to explain
doctor's bridge uh
to the developers
uh so um you can use this uh
as an infrastructure layer for building
your own cross chain application which i
think is amazing this is the next big
thing
maybe the current big big thing so
i'll show you some examples also
like the uh production examples which
we're using on a daily basis
uh
say a few few words about our future
plans
uh yes so uh don't hesitate to ask any
questions please
feel free to interrupt me if something
is unclear for you
alright so okay
let's move on
uh i hope you can see my slides
so in a few words uh let me remind you
what is octa's breach
first of all from the product point of
view this is a
well-known handy uh
tool for transferring fungible tokens
from one network to another
mostly from
some evm to the error scale
but you can also use it for transferring
from one evm directly to another evm so
there is a rich functionality
from the technical point of view this
thing uh the actual bridge has nothing
to do with the token transfers
specifically
the protocol itself
provides
the both way
message transfers between every scale
and any other connected blockchain
right now we have uh connected the evm
compatible networks there are plenty of
them
for now you can use ethereum finance
smart chain polygon phantom avalanche
milka amada
but
there is no actually problem to build uh
to to connect non-evm compatible
blockchains such as salana or nir
and
i know that uh some some of us are doing
the research and maybe um
you you will hear some some news about
it in the closest future
uh so yeah as i said the octus breach is
about transferring arbitrary messages
from one network to another
it is maintained by the special actors
which are called relays
so if you're familiar with the chain
link for example these are pretty much
the same uh these guys this relays
are in charge for confirming the fact of
the event
so
they they are re-elected which is
important for now every single week
which is also important uh it is
decentralized and anyone can become a
really all you need to do is to have a
stake in the
bridge tokens uh and uh
after that all you need is to run some
software which is called relay node
uh it is open source uh you can find it
on the proxis github
uh so uh and so that's it here is the
magic right now we have the
decentralized uh way to transfer
arbitrary messages from one network to
another
and uh what is personally my favorite
thing about october's bridge is that it
it is not about the token uh transfers
or something it is uh from the beginning
it was designed as an infrastructure
layer
so
uh literally anyone any developer can
connect to the octus bridge and use uh
its capabilities for its own
decentralized application
or which is even more important any
developer can uh
use the
uh
some sdk uh which is already available
to extend the current bridge
functionality
for example the cross chain fungible
token transfers is implemented but the
nft token transfers are not well there
is no problem for any developer to write
just a few contracts on the everscale
solidity
uh connect them uh to the bridge i'll
just i'll tell you how to do it a little
bit later and that's it now you have
your own cross chain functionality
so this is actually as i said my goal is
to explain to you how to
extend current
current functions
and build your own cross chain
applications
so
okay let's move on also a few few more
uh words about the cross chain
applications why should you even care
about them
uh well uh like uh not so long time ago
we had one network ethereum of course
and all the users were using it all the
liquidity was concentrated on it all the
apps were launched
only on ethereum right now the situation
is different there are plenty uh
plenty um
blockchains
uh like evm compatible non-vm compatible
solana near cosmos hubs uh i don't know
polka dot and so on and the users and
the funds are distributed around all of
them
uh and for example right now when you
are launching a decentralized
application you should answer yourself
question which network you should use
right let's say you want to launch your
application on ethereum but you should
keep in mind that it is for example
expensive sometimes
uh but uh for example has the largest
user base but you also have different
networks let's say binance smart chain
which is not so expensive but way less
uh secure
so
um and uh by using the uh technologies
like an octopus bridge you can launch
the uh that's your decentralized
application
uh
in a way which allows you to for example
connect users from any other blockchain
actually it it's not even so important
which blockchain you're using to launch
your uh product like as a whole network
users from any different network can uh
use your app
for example through the octus bridge
right the most like well-known examples
is of course token transfers which are
already implemented and available as an
open source and so on
you can also imagine nft transfers
like cross chain nfc transfers
another good example is the cross chain
dial for example in october's bridge we
we have the dao
and you can create a proposal as usual
but which is interesting you can specify
not only the
everscale actions because the error
scale is like a whole network for the
dow but you can also specify
the i don't know phantom phantom action
ethereum action finance smart chain
action all into a single proposal and uh
because dao is itself connected to the
octus bridge these pro these actions in
case the proposal is uh accepted uh this
will be transferred uh to
to these evm networks and executed in
them so for example you can i don't know
build the product with the vaults in
every single network and
rule them all from the single point
which is amazing i think
another good example also my my favorite
is the reputation systems
uh for example you can create the
application let's say in ethereum or
every scale which consumes the octaves
bridge the
all the data about some actions uh in
different networks for example you can
consume the list of uni swap trades for
a specific address or
compound liquidations
or dow votes and so on and by using this
data you can build a trunk trustless
transparent and provable let's say
credit score
right and uh for example issue and nft
which says like the credit score is 7
out of 10 because of i don't know bad
liquidations history and this nft can be
transferred
to a different network by using this uh
nft cross chain bridge and uh this uh
new nfc can be used for for example
under collectorized loan
i don't know in uh polygon
uh so yeah as you see this is an amazing
this is extremely scalable you can
create as much applications
as you want you know it's even hard to
imagine every single case
okay so
i think i have answered the questions
why why do we why does it matter
right
uh so
right now let's move on to the technical
details
the theory uh which will help you to
build your cross chain applications will
octa's bridge
so if you are familiar with the
development
uh then it will be
pretty especially with asynchronous
development it will be easy for you to
build the cross chain applications
because the model itself uh
is pretty close to the event callback
model i think it's just well known for
most of you
so basically all you need
is to specify the pair where the
first element is the target event and
the second one is the callback which
should be executed
uh in case the target event uh
exists i mean what was emitted for
example
uh so we can discuss on a high level the
cross chain token transfer
and basically uh this is just a two
event called back pairs
uh where for example in case the deposit
event occurred in the polygon
like the user have deposited 10 usdt
well in this case the callback will be
mint 10 10 uh synthetic usdt in the in
the error scale right so that's it
uh and pretty much the same uh with the
opposite direction in case user
has burned
the
this 10 usdt well the callback in
polygon will be to release uh usdt from
the vault
that's it i think it's it's it's an
extremely simple model actually
uh so
a few words about the terms uh this uh
event called back pairs are specified as
a separate smart contract so there is no
like huge centralized configuration
somewhere on a github
all the configurations are just uh smart
contracts on the everscale network you
can deploy
them yourself like no problem
uh these configurations are also like a
pretty standard smart contract so
they're already developed by us you can
just use them most likely you don't need
to develop your own custom configuration
contracts
so just
feel free to use
ours right out of the box
but one important thing that's to avoid
the potential
ddos attacks uh you can't create as many
configurations and expect relays to
maintain them uh for now uh dao bridge
dao
needs to approve every single
configuration
which basically says that okay release
now you're
uh responsible for maintaining this uh
event callback
pairs maybe we will get rid of it later
or maybe not i'm not sure right now
it is it works this way
uh so
uh okay uh well this is this was the
basic theory right now we can move on
uh separately to the evm to ever scale
pipeline and after that i'll
tell you about the everscale to evm
pipeline which is pretty much the same
but has a few important differences
so uh
okay let's let's move on
uh so as i said uh
we are talking about the event callback
model
and every single target event uh let's
say from the polygon
uh
it should be represented
as a separate smart contract which is
called event contract in our terms
uh this is extremely lightweight
simple and cheap smart construct
so
someone should deploy it usually user
deploys it for himself and basically
what does it mean
uh that event contract stores all the
data about the target event like the
content of the event i don't know
transaction hash block hash and
stuff like that
uh so after
after the event contract is deployed
relays
uh
basically need to
uh compare the exact event in the
polygon and the events representation uh
in the form of event contracts and in
case everything is is fine everything is
the same all the details block hashes
and so on
uh is the same then relay just
sends every single relay sends
the special confirmation message
so
interesting thing that in every scale it
is possible to implement
the contract base itself
model
that's why relays don't even have their
wallets they don't even have their
errors to spend on a guest
event contracts pays themselves for
confirmations or rejects
uh and uh
yeah
this is also like an amazing thing about
the error scale and uh once uh the some
threshold is reached then the callback
is executed so that that's it it is
it's that simple
uh so um as i said uh we have the
configuration contracts and they're used
as a factory for event
contracts that's it
uh so uh
let's say uh in case of the regular
token transfer cross chain
uh the
callback contra contract implements the
mint functionality and
it
sees the details from the event contract
it sees that okay
the 10 usdt was locked on the polygon
so it means that i should mean 10 usdt
to this user like that's it uh i hope i
hope it's it's clear how to implement
the evm to ever scale
uh
pipelines also i'll tell you about the
everscale to evm pipelines which means
that it should be clear for you how to
implement evm to evm pipelines this is
also an amazing thing you can
create the crosschain applications and
your user don't need even to know about
the ever scale
you don't even need to have a wallet or
something
you're just using these two pipelines
and uh now you're connecting to evm
networks amazing feature
uh so yeah a few words about the
everscale to evm
pipeline the only difference everything
is pretty much the same the only
difference is that relays don't send any
messages to the evm as they are doing by
sending messages to the everscale
this is as you
as you know
it may be pretty expensive because of
the network fees let's say in ethereum
uh so what the relays are doing instead
they're
storing uh some signature which is made
with their private key uh to their
they're putting the signature to the
event contract on the everscale side and
uh
the public key of the relays unknown on
the polygon for example there is a
special smart contract which stores this
uh public key and you can ask it let's
say uh who signed this payload was it a
relay or not
so oh and that's it since you have the
signatures and you have the payload you
can uh send them to some let's say evm
polygon vault
and the vault will check that these
signatures were made by the
actual relays and if everything is
correct if
the threshold is reached and so on well
then the vault will release the
usdt uh to the user so uh that's it as
you see it is reliable and uh pretty
cheap uh i mean from the economy point
of view there is no struggle for relays
from uh sending uh regular transactions
to the evm uh networks
uh okay so i think we can
move on from here so yeah let me just uh
clarify once again the
most common uh octus bridge pipeline
the cross chain token transfer
so as you see uh it can consists
basically from two pipelines
one is uh
ethereum to every scale where user locks
the world uh they use the t on the world
which leads to the target event
and uh
this target event leads to uh minting
usdt synthetic usdt
uh on the everscale and uh burning this
usdt leads to releasing them on the
ethereum world so you know
that's it i don't know i don't even know
what to say because it is extremely
simple pipeline and you can create your
own customize this one
and it will work
just the same
so all the contracts also are open
source of course we're using a gpl
license
so uh the evm volts contract is
basically the fork of y iron with two
walls uh which is uh
which allows us to
uh
earn yields on the locked funds using
strategies and so on and you can also
see the
callback contract who who is responsible
for minting
usdt tokens on the error scale side
so that's it you can uh imagine the same
functionality with the i don't know nft
token transfer or for example
transferring uh oracle's events from the
ethereum let's say chain link oracle
events
uh which uh will lead to creating the
decentralized oracle network on the
error scale
you know without even changing knowing
uh about all this uh bridge and
everscale and so on
uh
so that's it
uh okay uh let me
yeah yeah let me move on a few more
things like as i said uh configurations
are already implemented just use them
rather out of the box
uh event contracts are usually uh looks
the same
they're all like standard only in case
there are a few cases when you need a
custom event contracts basically when
you need a data mutation inside them but
this is like complex and rare scenario
so
most likely you don't need to implement
this event contract yourself
and it means that basically all you need
to implement is just one contract which
is responsible for the callback logic
on every scale and one contract which is
responsible for callback logic on the
evm side
so uh yeah that that's it all these
contracts have uh the standard interface
you can uh see for
for details in our repos i think it is
like
uh
not a complex task to implement this
contract
um yes so uh
that's it this is a pretty small
workshop
i hope
i was clear and if you have any
questions please feel free to ask
thank you sergey
do you have any questions guys
okay we have one online question
probably
um so team rubicon asks uh sergey if you
had to single out
uh the key advantage of octus bridge
over other bridges what would you single
out first
uh i would say that
the key advantages as the design which
is not about the specific
action like token transfer or anything
else but the design is about the
infrastructure layer literally anyone
can implement any cross chain logic by
using octagon bridge so uh this is you
know
as simple as implementing uh i don't
know
solidity uh
defy application so there is a no uh
no bottleneck no complex uh
questions all you need is just to
develop a few contracts connect them to
the actors bridge and you're ready to go
your cross chain decentralized
application is done i think it's it's
amazing
nice uh i have a question
i think in the last update to the bridge
uh that was announced
um
we said that uh we're adding time stamps
um
on real for relayers and that this was
going to pave the way for uh chain-link
oracles to be
uh integrated into the um into the brit
into the octus bridge
is what uh
a what's the big benefit of adding
timestamps and then what benefit would
uh
chain link oracle's
bring to the bridge
uh yeah let me
answer separately for these two
questions first of all about the bridge
updates uh for now uh when you're uh
transferring the events uh to the let's
say every scale right uh you're passing
uh we're passing a lot of data but we're
not passing the exact timestamp of the
event and uh for example most likely uh
you don't need this let's say in case of
the token transactions you don't care
when the deposit was made right uh
it can be made one hour ago or uh to two
months ago well it still means that you
need to means 10 usdt
to the user in case of the
[Music]
oracle network it matters because uh you
have to know uh
you know when this price was uh
submitted to the network uh you have to
build uh how to say sequence of these
dots right you have to know that okay
this price was before that price and to
do this you need to understand the
timestamp of every single point so
that's why we need um to add them
otherwise we can't uh create this robust
uh
oracle network
uh so i hope i uh answered your question
and the second one about the
you know cross chain oracle network
itself i think this is an amazing uh
feature we definitely needs uh
for it in the every scale ecosystem uh
all
well-known uh defy applications such as
i don't know compounds maker
uh every every other uh relies on the
uh oracle networks because it's uh
insecure to rely on the unchained price
feeds such as i don't know unit swap of
course you can use uh time weighted
average price but uh anyway uh
there are cases when you need
the
um oracle network and we will also need
it on the error scale to build every
type of the
financial applications
so we can build our own chain link we
can you know build the architecture and
stuff and develop all of this but i
think it's just an amazing feature that
we did we don't even need to do this
since we have the arbitrary uh message
channel we can just consume the
channeling data uh pass them to the
error scale and here it is without any
uh complex development we have our own
decentralized and secure oracle network
uh so i think it's it's it's inevitable
right to build the complex uh defy
applications
thank you great
thank you guys
any other question about the how
october's bridge works so maybe how you
can integrate with that
nobody wants i won't say so okay
thank you sergey so um
okay guys let's uh have in this case uh
a short break five minutes so we uh are
finishing uh
the presentation of our tracks for
tomorrow and uh
uh please don't go too far away so uh
just a few minutes so we will present
the tracks and examples of tasks that we
expect from you on the hackathon of
course those tasks are not closed
list
in fact you can invent your own task and
what you believe the most uh important
uh we just want to inspire you about how
how it will be
what will be useful
okay thank you so much
okay guys thank you for patience we just
need couple more minutes uh to finalize
all the examples and get all the mentors
online
uh we want to uh introduce
them to you
uh so meanwhile so i just want to maybe
say a few words about the
organization part
uh so tomorrow we start at 10 a.m uh
belgrade time so uh in this very room so
we will organize the working places uh
so please come
with your laptops uh so just to start co
programming for those who are remotes so
of course you can also come
so
actually two of our mentors are already
here so one you know already alexander
from it gold another one is alexander
hemsoff who is uh also leads a
blockchain developer from brooksus
uh so uh also we have two people who are
connecting now uh
so they will also guide you
uh plus uh i want to remind you that uh
we have an excellent chat on discord and
uh we hope the have the whole our team
uh uh
there so if in case you have any
question
uh anything you want to ask about
integration with bridge about everscale
about how to write smart contracts uh
any question you you face so you can
always ask
it's there so
just add uh to the uh
discord server so you had the qr code
link back there
and also ping our moderators to give you
the role just to add you to it into the
hackathon chat
so see you in two minutes so
with the tasks
thank you
and
all right so we're in place finally
okay so i will say a few introductory
words about the
hackathon tracks so what we are going uh
you're going to do tomorrow
we have decided this time that we will
would like to focus on three tracks
one of the tracks is
focused on the tooling
or developing for developers letting
other developers easily create the
products uh based on everscale and
noctus bridge technologies
uh uh the second track is named
christian excellence so uh meaning that
we will be judging uh how interesting is
the idea behind
this
cross chain uh applications that you
will develop
so
the more creative you are so the more
unusual cases you will think
so the better so uh we will not judge
here for for interface part so it can be
a console program or purely smart
contract that you can just call
and we have the sword track named uh ui
ux perfection uh
this is pretty much the same as crosston
excellence but uh here we will be more
focused on the visual part uh of your
application using the octus bridge
technology so it can be
some some game something so actually
guys uh have prepared for you uh some
ideas of applications that you can
develop
so uh now i'm giving the floor to
alexander
so he will
now present what they have generated
this one
okay
for first track development for
developers
we write
for example these
tasks tasks
first is a
simple
factory for creating
which work to create
your own dao
so
second is
some
sdk bindings
for nicotine
library
um for example
you can create buildings for python or
go
so
next is
sdk for octus bridge or flat cube
whatever you want and
some
maybe
it can be
[Music]
some examples for using
[Music]
octus bridge or fluid cube
for
external solutions
uh so
and next is
for
ui ux
perfection track and
our example
is a
widget
widget constructor
which allowed to specify
what type of tokens you
want to
receive
in every scale
and
from
which
networks
and
configure
some rules and
it
must generate some
javascript code
which you can
include in
into your
application
so uh
last track is cross chain
excellence track and
for example
you can create
some
cross chain swap
[Music]
so you can
swap tokens
in
you can send transactions
from metamask and
swap will be performed
into
on flat cube and you receive tokens
[Music]
in
eom network
so
for example second task is
similar but uh
ah okay
so we have
hide and breach
technology
included in
october's bridge it allows to
swap
it allows to
receive
errors
when you send
different tokens from
other networks
it will
automatically swaps
two hours
and the
second task is creating smart contract
which
[Music]
which perform swap to
a special token on every scale when you
you
send
tokens
from
across the bridge to this contract
so
that's all
yeah thank alex so uh these are just
examples so of what you can do with our
technologies so in case you uh think
about some idea that you have on your
mind so uh or maybe you have several
ideas that you want to develop but you
uh
don't know which one to choose so don't
hesitate to contact
anyone from our team so
and consult so we will advise so what
looks more promising
uh
so uh we also have decided to prolong
that information until end of the day so
because some of people has asked
to add
some of the colleagues as well
so
you have time until end of the day to
form the team so let's point it like uh
midnight
belgrade time today uh and so uh
tomorrow 10 a.m again here in the same
place so we are waiting for you to start
officially the hackathon if you have any
questions so please raise your hands
or maybe there are some online questions
okay no more questions okay thank you
for your patience guys i'm really glad
to see you here so and all the ones that
are online with us today so i wish you a
good luck and
definitely the victory tomorrow
uh so uh please come enjoy take get fun
so enjoying our growing never scale and
lotus bridge family thank you so much
[Applause]
you
