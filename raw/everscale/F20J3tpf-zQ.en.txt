foreign
hi everyone
hi
i'm
so
silently
we are waiting blood i guess
it looks like
some problems
a lot
yes waiting for us
great guys sorry sorry for a delay so
i had some emergency on my provider site
and had to
really switch to the mobile
setup
uh okay hello everyone
we will not wait for a minute even uh so
welcome everyone our 51st uh weekly defy
governance goal
so we have quite an agenda for today and
uh
yeah sorry to jump in and just interrupt
your discussion so what we're saying
is
nothing
there
okay
okay very good so uh actually
we have quite tight agenda for today and
um
we have
two ama sessions today and one contest
discussion
uh so
let's let's begin
so first of all let's start with the
contest update traditionally
so we have the text contest voting stage
uh coming to its end and uh so there are
the three and something days left so
please do not decide until the very last
moment and
make sure to vote for those we will have
the flex
presentation today and
to discuss
sorry um yeah so uh to present uh the
solution uh for this contest and maybe
some other teams uh will wish also to
prepare uh at least a short demo of the
solution to help jurors make the
decision
um
okay and uh there is also one day left
for the free terms of sovereign identity
framework stage two to submit
so if anyone is willing to participate
in this contest so please do not put
aside again for the very last moment so
there are still no uh
no submissions in there so but i hope
that we will have some
um yeah so that's it actually for
contest updates and uh we will discuss a
decentralized launchpad uh contest today
but a bit later so uh and now let's
directly jump into flex ama media please
yeah um so just share the screen yeah i
don't know but i will not present like
there
you see other sites who will present i
think
the solution i will just say just to
remind everyone what what is flex really
and what's the challenge in there
so the flex is the
is the first
decentralized order book exchange
on friton
and it also
um
the
um like
the only decentralized order book which
also made in distributed computing and
distributed programming which means that
all its contracts are completely atomic
meaning there
there is no central
hashmap of anything
in
um in flex now
so after we built
the um
the order book itself
we have also added
the the pools now it's important that
by the way can you please mute whoever
is not talking
things
um it is important that um
you know that that the exchange will
have a liquidity pool right
so because we have a
order book
we don't need to have a liquidity pool
as an exchange i mean i just want to
remind everyone that liquidity pool
as working as an exchange solution is
just
just something proposed by vitalik
buterian to avoid
the
um
the limitations of the like other
blockchains where you could not do
properly
order book like if they
if they to use the the liquidity pool as
an exchange
is a hack really it's not what you would
do if you wouldn't have limitations of
the you know other like other
blockchains have so because like if you
traditional exchanges are not liquidity
pools traditional exchanges are order
books and there is a reason for that
actually not one
and not two reasons for that
and if you want to provide the liquidity
there are separate mechanism for that
which called market making right you
have usually you have like like nasdaq
or nyse like exchange uh which is an
order book exchange which can produce
like millions of transactions per second
and
more or less right on on this order
books and uh if you want to provide the
liquidity you need to like be a market
maker you create your own like market
making pool like algorithms and all so
on and you can use different strategies
different algorithms for maintaining
your pools you can have an investments
that that you know come to your pool
from different sources
and you can pay different you know
whatever fees on top of that so it's
really flexible structure where
everything is separated like in in in
blockchains like in solutions like
ethereum you have uni swap which you
where you cannot do all of these things
so you cannot have strategies you cannot
have all the order book like
what order books gives you and you also
cannot have liquidity pools on top of
liquidity pool because like this is the
liquidity pool
itself
so the flaxes is more traditional in
terms of
its architecture as an exchange because
freetown
and particular like in in general and
uh distributed programming in in
particular allows you to do such things
now you can use the whole free tone as a
database and that's what flex is doing
so i think today presentation
again and this is one aspect of that
this is a back end right and well i
already explained that once so just
repeating that now we added the amm so
there is the today's presentation will
contain an amn to the pair which and
anyone can create as many you can create
as many market maker pools as you want
and you can create an amm and market
pool on top of that with any rules
whatsoever and so on you can create
mechanics like uni swap token
for example listing
over the liquidity pool
over
the
order book decentralized order book like
flex and and we will continue to work on
this
and um there is a there is a project
that i i think already promotes on the
last community call which is my my
podcast
which is which i'm starting which
actually will be
a
lounge pool and that's why i'm actually
very interested in the contest that i
didn't know that you're going to launch
about the liquid about the yeah lounge
parts and large pools
um we would i would very much like to
participate in that because actually
that's what i'm doing right now so i'm
we're actually you're more than welcome
you know that's great as usual
i think that's an unbelievable
coincidence i really didn't know
anything about it yeah yeah and by the
way i i'm really uh
just challenging all the dex teams to
also participate in the ideal contest
because uh actually it is something that
uh is complementary to the decks itself
and um
yeah it's the next logical step at least
yeah so anyway so so so for example i'm
going to start this the podcast which
will be actually launch pool on top of
flex exchange
but with a separate set of smart
contracts on top of some amm which will
be configured to accommodate the the
lounge pool which again something you
cannot do
with the regular uh like um you know
liquidity pool type of exchange like you
as well
um well it's at least that's very hard
to do
i'm not saying maybe maybe you can but
it's really hard to do
um
so so this is one aspect of that and the
other aspect of that
is the interface
all right so today we're going to show
you the graphical user interface not
only the what you call the bot user
interface but i want to say a few words
about this interface
um this interface is actually
the bot
it is true
real debug
running in a browser in a technology we
call and it's described in white paper
technology is called pipes
and this thing allows you to actually
take debot actions make pipes out of
that and wrap it into the normal kind of
what you say normal web page but this
web page is actually it's a it's a it's
a package
which which which executes in basm
and and that packages you can it's a
standalone package you actually you can
download it from anywhere you want like
you can take it on cd-rom i don't know
usb drive
and or in distribute any way you want
and then you just open it in the browser
and it will start to execute the sdk
with engine
debugs and on top of these debug it will
execute locally
the
the web interface and you will see that
you have actually familiar just web page
but i just wanted to you to understand
that i want to judge us also to
understand and actually like go and see
it
that it's uh
it's a completely like it's there is no
web page really there is no web server
involved it's all debug technology from
the beginning till the end okay and
okay
now switching to no switch
[Laughter]
of course this is just the mvp so back
on the on the interface side we will
continue to work on that but i think you
get you will get the idea sergey the
floor is yours thanks
thank you media for the introductory
rewards
and
i'm happy i was especially honored today
to make a presentation on behalf of the
flex team
the other team members may
correct me or it's something i forget to
highlight
here
we have today
present
as i saw apart from media here andrew
flex contract developer
uh michael fleck's debut developer and
nikki the board browser developer
and this only part of great developers
from our team
okay um and here's we have uh i just
shared this interface as you already
know
now the flex is um
distributed order book and
traders communicate with it
with the help of flags deport
so this debate can be accessed both from
the the browser itself or we did
here a graphical user interface for
traders uh which is
available currently available at flex
console
so meet already mentioned that um
basically whenever you
load the bundle to your local machine
all transactions are executed locally
and doesn't depend on the so at least
address
so basically
we need to keep it in mind
uh
let's go to the interface see what's
currently available here
uh first we've got a
network switch and
the interface currently works with both
magnet and div net
and next to it
we see a
trade pair switcher
there are not
many uh
pairs in
maynet at the moment but we see some
pairs that we created
uh
for demonstrations especially call them
testosterone
just to discourage people to
spend real money on these tokens
at the moment
so for each trade pair we have
three
major areas the first area is the charts
area then we have
the order book and recent trades area
and finally we have a buy and sell areas
where traders can buy or sell the first
token in the in the trade pair
there are also a couple of useful links
available
i just want to mention it the first is a
link to a help
document in flex
so it's a general inscription for
newcomers what is flex what can i trade
on flags how to buy and sell and so on
and
it will be updated
[Music]
when we add or update all features
so let us return here and the other
useful link is get serve so
basically
for users
who don't get sf a wallet yet
an accounting search is required for
trading on
on the flex exchange so
it's provided
as well as a useful reference
let's see more details to specific areas
so
for
this two tone pair
in my nether
[Music]
we have an auto book with manually
posted orders
by
let's say individual traders
orders for cell
highlighted in red
and all those
biodoes highlighted in green
we see that
no
a horizontal horizontal bar is
proportional to the value
in the order set this price level
that is the amount multiplied by price
so we see that
overall
value in sell orders
uh uh much higher than in buy orders and
the overall
market for this token looks a little
bearish
not
too much transactions there is
some of them but
we can see here a depth
chart
price history for this token
not much for the candlestick chart
will show this chart
[Music]
and demonstrate a
demonstrated another pair
later in the demonstration
so
let's try to
make transactions in flags in this order
book
assume i want to buy a few tokens at the
best market price and i see that the
best market price here is around point
one
uh tone
per typically token so
i can just
click this price uh to how to fill the
buy order fields i don't want to buy
i think three tokens is enough for me
i press the buy button and be now being
redirected to the softboard
let us go through authorization
i we cannot see that you know that right
oh because there's only one screen
i see probably i need to stop shay here
and uh
yeah
it's unlikely because it's interesting
to to see both interfaces
ah yeah well
okay let me share
the new interface but
it's um anyway you can try yourself so
kind of
get the same experience
share your entire screen
entire screen
yep
let's
yeah can you see both screen yes yes we
can so we have flex debot and both
trading yeah
exactly great
so basically we have some
information messages
clicking
that i understand
[Music]
actually i can't make a buy here i need
to send some tokens
at my client
i was trading too intensely probably
uh today to spend
all tokens
send me your address i'll send you to
some tokens
uh
here's my internet i can
okay we realized
that i have more
just maybe stop sharing to send well let
me stop sharing for the moment and i
said some toys some tokens yeah
uh
in just a moment
them
i think
they will arrive soon
probably i'll close this instance and
reshape the screen again
so let's try one more time
by testing
you see if you don't have a
flex client deployed
and
the bot will
[Music]
ask you to deploy the client first
but i am happy to have the client deploy
they hopefully enough balance
okay now it's okay
uh you see that uh
this bar will cost me 1.8 tons so the
bot
adds a
one and a half token
uh on top of the total sum
uh just ensure
that all transactions will be executed
and on your spot unused part will be
returned later so i'm happy to continue
here
let me confirm transactions
so currently uh i initiated an external
message that
was sent to the
flex client and it initiated a chain of
transaction within the board but
we need to look here this amount should
change first after i buy
the deal will be done oh we see here
it was uh 8 38 and out 8 30
uh
five so my three tokens has been
purchased and
the report will report soon as well if
you don't have
if the tv balance on your wallet is not
updated you you can just press update of
the book and we see it changed
the amount
on my tip latest
the
balance has been increased so basically
we just executed a transaction best
available market price here
again just to point out something that
you cannot do the liquidity-based thing
right you cannot do that you are not in
control of your price this is important
very important definition of the order
book because many strategies are based
on this on how you analyze the actual
order book in liquidity pool you don't
have order books nothing to analyze you
just execute whatever price it is
in in just you know one divided by
another
okay
yeah
and uh you see a currently the bot is a
kind of waiting uh for
all the pipe chain being processed where
am i planning to make this process
more synchronous uh to provide feedback
faster it is possible and
it will improve the user experience but
um yeah but it's also important to
mention that as you as you could see the
transaction itself on the order book was
was almost momentarious like once the
external message arrived
boom it was executed the rest of
transactions are just basically all
sorts of um
after the fact transactions you already
got your tokens but there are several
transactions that we need to
track
and these transactions relate to
announcements of this trade to some
other uh contracts like imm for example
basically we have a and
notify that broadcast or all subscribes
uh all these events that happen on
flex
uh okay so now we just
saw an example of
transactions with the manually placed
orders so i just want to go to devnet to
see more examples
you can change the network
uh
on the new network uh internet we have
more
different uh token paths
because a lot of testing goes over here
and
first
what i want to show is the
earth token
impervious storm
so basically what's going on here is a
trade debate is
make some trading
with itself
so we we have here
some price history the price is
fluctuates here
we have candlestick chart so basically
um
[Music]
this is an interval chart and
we see the results of the trading in
in particular interval of time here it's
half an hour we see if we click on the
particular interval we see all the
details of trading high low or open
close prices and the
closing price is below the open price we
have a red candle
if we're closing prices above the open
we have green
candle on this kind of things
so basically in the
in the upper right corner we see the
volume of trade for the interval as well
a bit of interactivity uh on the
other book we don't have a
a large auto book here because the the
boat con
trades with itself all the time so
whenever the orders appear they
uh
they have been traded
almost momentarily there is some trade
history that's a lot we're not going to
trade with the board let's
let's it enjoy itself
i
i prefer uh to demonstrate you another
very important uh example is the
demonstration of trading with amen
so
media already
discussed it automatically
there
a question from the audience so uh uh
why when buying at the price of
0.10001 the cheaper books at 0.1 and
0.05 were not filled first so um
can you comment on this please as well
because there was no debot or any um
like program that executed that strategy
on this order book
and if if you want to fill if you want
to create a strategy over order book you
need to have an algorithm which executes
the strategy so you can for example make
a like a like a just a server program
for example you can make also a
automatic program that you will see now
but you can have a like a solar program
which would monitor the prices of the of
the
um
of the book
and execute whatever strategy you want
and you can
fill order you can you know whatever
like execute whatever strategy you want
over the over the order book
just because it's totally atomic the
order book itself doesn't have logic you
need to create a logic on top of the
order book if you want to do anything
but you can do anything you want
basically yeah sure
okay thank you yeah the price is atomic
object
on flex and uh but the flex debot has
the entire autobook
known
so basically we can
trade with specific prices or
basically the
uh
flex debate level we can create
more complex
orders not just buy and sell but for
example at a specific price specific
volume but
like
market orders when i want to buy a
certain amount of tokens at best market
price and the price is in the autobook
available and they both just
buy start
buying at the best price and go up to
them
on the other book so we're planning to
realize
market orders
and
you see
it's possible to make
the bots smart and smarter smart i
realize different strategies so
basically whenever you have the
audiobook available for you
you can
[Music]
just implement various uh algorithm
on the debate level and it's not only on
debt level as you can see with imma it's
also can be on the smart contract level
so you actually don't but of course you
need someone to
to like um well the the trades are going
to ping your
smart contract to execute whatever logic
you want and we have a possibility to
implement it already to have that
notification so you can subscribe to
notifications with your whatever smart
contract you want
and you get notifications about every
trade so you know so your smart contract
will actually know the whole order book
and what happens to it and it can be
triggered by these trades as an events
and then you can implement any logic you
want and you also can do it off chain so
like with through the points
so anything you want
thank you let's move on
so here we see the autobook of
posted by automatic market maker what uh
imma
mm contact does
it
uses available liquidity from its pool
uh to place buying cell orders
sorry just a moment
here so the book
you see
uh
because i i see this list of traders
sorry
i just want to show you the audible
it uses liquidity in its pool liquidity
of
tp tokens and
of terms for example or any other pairs
uh to make market orders around the
recent market price
so whenever we are trading with a man it
uh
executes the deal and after it it
cancels previous orders and
post new orders around the new market
around the recent
price
and we can see that
i will demonstrate you that it is not
not a static
or the book but it's a dynamic
of the book
let us
make a transaction say
let us make the same transaction
yeah and
currently it's deployed
and tested in devnet
but
just for the matter of
saving
some turns
but
it can easily
be deployed in mynet as well
let us repeat the same
transaction side by
the best market
price by three
tokens
i want to buy three boosts
again
being redirected to the bot itself
authorization
hope we now balance here
confirm transaction again i i saw this
message and we need to see what will be
happening
with our price contract so
we initiated teaching your messages and
we see that it has been changed there is
two
vehicle
and it means that i saw my expect
information from the debate that
everything completed
yeah and we see that
[Music]
just
fix
three
tones with the latest price so currently
the
amim constants previous orders
and it should
post new orders
around the
latest
market price so
i hope we'll see a new the book
with the orders around three yeah we
have
uh
the best
buy order
is
price 2.5 the base
uh sell the enterprise 3.5
uh we have uh with a
step of 0.5 we have
a new order book
so i'll update my my yeah
yeah
i have four tokens used to be one i
bought
four boost
three
boost tokens
so basically here we see a demonstration
of trading with a mm and
at the moment
the
am own
provides liquidity
uh to the
mm pool but basically we also um
a liquidity depot will be available soon
so any liquidity provider
can
will be able to contribute uh
[Music]
to provide liquidity to the pool to own
some
and share rewards from trading on flex
anyone can actually launch their own
pool as well they can launch your own
pool and uh and get a subscribe based
communication service and create a
different logic mmm or you know imma
which you control with your money with
your liquidity with your providers and
on top of we will provide some
contracts like template court contracts
on top of the
amm and on top of flex which are which
will be related to
like
templates for launching your own
liquidity pools and
governance tokens on top of this deep
liquidity pools and so on and so forth
but that's next stage
okay yeah i think thank you guys
basically um it's all that i was
planning to show
as demonstration i don't know media do
you want to say anything about
governance talking for flex
oh well as i said there will be
governance talking for flex and we're
working on that
right now
and there but there will be also like a
old template model for
governance tokens that you can launch
with your token because there is a logic
which already
includes in flex which are wrapper
logic so you can basically wrap any
token you wanted to the flex tip 3 token
tip 3 talking to the flex tip 3 token
and you know
trade it on there but also we'll provide
you with some templates of how to
launching your your like governance
tokens on flex and uh and all things
around that
okay okay guys we are running
off time a bit thank you very much let's
see thank you so much for presentation
so let's maybe decay five minutes for
questions
and uh
if there will be too many so we'll just
move them to the offline part
and uh yeah so any questions guys please
yes no please
yeah um
maybe it was already said i'm sorry
uh but
how can you okay so for example i
swapped some tokens on uh
flex um
how can i if i want to send them
manually
to someone else um how do i get them
into how do i control the deep free
tokens manually
aside from using the exchange you you
you there is a there is like a tip 3
token debot which you can use to control
your tokens
that's not a problem but you have to
remember that once you're trading this
the wallet
is you're surrendering the control to
the exchange
so like the tippery token wallet that
you have on the exchange is controlled
by the order book
so therefore
um well
one of the contract price contract of
the order book i would say this one so
you cannot really do anything while
you're trading but of course you can
withdraw tokens once they are on their
wallet
once you're not trading meaning
and
just to make sure you can only uh buy
and sell four tons right you can't no
between three two you can
yes you can here you go we have for
example uh
pairs of the
uh
different kinds of pairs
yeah you can you can you can trade
between
three and tone and between g3 and t3
any more questions
yeah
alexander please
i know i finished
hello
guys uh
uh can you explain a little bit more
about this
solution with uh installation
um
this devote interface with sdk
i mean
what's interesting
this is is this mean that
for example on my pc and windows i
um download and
ins
did installation through except for exit
file for example and after that
um
i can
use um
any browser yes
and it will work directly through the
bot with blockchain and it's not need
something more like
browser extension etc etc exactly you
only need a browser with wasm
that's all
um
what's about future if we
will use the linux macintosh or ipod
even for mobile
it doesn't matter but uh how you will
install its own ipad for example this
there is you just need a bundle it's not
an exact it's just a bundle that that
your browser opens and you can actually
down you will be able like if you want
you can download this bundle even from
blockchain
like you can place this bundle on the
blockchain you can open a wallet on your
like in in the browser some
wallet extension or whatever and just
download that bundle there are many ways
of how to distribute that bundle
no at least i see two ways
uh um
download and install like um
software with uh yes
yeah you can no you
you don't need a browser extension for
example on ipad i'm not sure what i
catch how to use on ipod yes i mean it's
ios for example it doesn't matter as
long as the safari browser is okay
supporting
you just open that bundle in safari
browser and that's all you can open it
up from the local
like machine right
okay
thank you of course there are like the
bundling itself we didn't do uh of
course but uh but it will be like you
you you will be you can for example pack
everything together you can make a like
an ios application which would include
the bundle in the browser altogether and
you just open that application it will
open the browser and
end open the bundle for example you can
do many things
as long as like you you there's like
hundreds of way how to distribute this
bundle
um to your machine
okay without the need for any kind of
web server
good idea
okay guys let's move on alexander
is every single year for you
yeah
uh yeah we have one more hand so we have
time for one one more question and let's
move on elena please
yeah hi everyone we have question from
heart criteria from the contest
uh what uh guys what does what uh
mechanisms uh for maintaining liquidity
order book users in the system you have
that's what that was the half of
presentation it's imm
that's the mechanism of the liquidity
providing
automated market maker is the liquidity
pool
so you kind of can put liquidity into
market maker right now it supports like
you need to put both both ends of the
liquidity like of the
pair
in the future you can make
different logics on top of that it's
completely flexible
pardon my
no pun intended you wanted to say this
definitely
but this is exactly the amm that we just
that you just see on your screen is the
the order book that you just saw how
it's uh
re-rearranged itself it's this is the
liquidity providing mechanism
okay and what about maintaining users
like because as i remember it was the
part of the idea of having this third
stage like
maintaining users
like staking like farming like these
mechanisms there are no staking or
farming mechanisms in in in that
solution right now so that was that that
isn't the part of the
of this uh solution currently as i said
there will be like
we will work on that but the next stage
right now there are no governance tokens
or like liquidity things but you can you
know you can connect liquidity providers
can uh
share the profit of the automated magic
model
trades on flex and
uh earn some profit on spreads and
it's just shipped to liquidity providers
like it's like in any any
exchange real exchange not liquidity
pool
you have
the flexibility of building
on top of one exchange you build myriads
of
different solutions and these solutions
can include you know whatever you want
liquidity farming
uh staking whatever governance whatever
you want really and anyone can do it on
the same pair
so you don't need to build it you don't
need to hardwire it like to your
particular liquidity pool which supports
particular pair you can create
solution for particular pair
and you can create many solutions
liquidity solutions liquidity pools
taking farming one one pair so you can
have one pair and have like 10
different uh farming mechanism on top of
this pair
or combination of pairs
or combination of liquidity
okay just just to be sure because it was
a hard criteria for this contest this is
why
we promoted the connector to that so you
can
you know connect your own
thing
but again if you want to deduct points
on that that's fine with us
okay guys so sorry to interrupt so we
really need to move on because uh we
have not so much time left so thank you
for questions and opinions
yeah if there are any other questions so
so please do not hesitate to ask
guys directly in the chat so and let's
move on
so actually uh we have uh guests here
who i will just explain a bit about the
decentralized launchpad
contest
just let me ping them
just to let them know that uh
i will invite them so i see a man right
here
yeah uh just before uh i will give a
word to ramon so
who represent one of the teams uh that
will also be
participating in this contest already so
they already know this
so um
and they will tell a bit about
their project
in future and we have also several other
teams who have already
uh
announced that they will participate in
this contest so uh
this is something new so nobody has seen
this already so for four guys from 40
foot so it's also a novelty so actually
uh what this contest uh
is about and how it will be structured
so traditionally we will start with the
architecture and design uh stage
and
one of the
new points here that were not
previously in our contest is a
requirement to
maximize the reusage of the already
existing solutions
so i even put this in the hot criteria
so uh because uh actually
this is something that we need to really
motivate because we have already created
a really really
well developed ecosystem and we want uh
each new contest to be relying on those
solutions that have previously been
developed
uh motivating
on its own so uh the developers of those
solutions to maintain them and
get
some demand for these services and
whatever
uh yeah so actually what the launch pad
is about if you don't know so actually
this is a decentralized way of launching
a new projects with crowdfunding
uh however as you may know so when at
the
era of icos there were quite a lot of uh
scammy projects that
actually didn't
uh
really deliver and they just took the
money of investors and went away so this
is not the case that we will tolerate
here actually and this is why
we uh
put here some requirements for
the control of the liquidity uh
through the vesting and through the
consensus of investors uh for
uh releasing the next trench of the
vesting to to the project and the
ability also to uh withdraw the funds if
the project didn't uh
achieve uh the kp the next milestone kpi
and the investors uh at least will get a
part of the money back
uh
also what is in this uh contest is
actually about uh
mainly the architecture of how the
system will will be built and we also
insist that the system should be purely
on chain
so meaning that uh all the interfaces
and off-chain parts should be
supplementary and do not affect the
core functionality of the launch pad um
and
they can help they can add some
convenience but if we take out all the
off-chain parts and all the interfaces
uh you should be able to uh
really do everything you need with this
launchpad only through
i don't know a ton of cli calls
yeah and also uh there should be a draft
of uh a platform roadmap because what we
learned from the decks uh is that
actually many things can change and
different teams sees the development of
such platforms uh in a different way
and this is good actually because we can
collect some feedback so we can collect
some information and improve the
implementation contest and make it more
universal
to let
more people come and join the contest
and of course it should be purely
decentralized so including censorship
resistance distributed management
i have some kind of dao in mind but
maybe the team can propose some
different ways
of
decentralizedly
managing
this project uh so uh i will post the
link to this document together with uh
with the forum uh publication to the
chat right after the call so everyone
can
have a look on the content description
and participate in discussion for sure
so uh
i personally believe that we will be
able to do this by monday and
launch this contest on monday already to
not just put this aside for a long time
so but if there are some uh critical uh
[Music]
disagreements between the community so
it may take a bit longer but
i
really uh
ask you to do everything for us to
launch this contest next week
uh yeah so uh and now uh roman who is
representing the 40-foot
project so will tell us a bit more about
uh about themselves and uh maybe also
say a few words about what they are
doing actually and why they decided to
to go for free time with the project so
roman please you can share
yes uh thank you woody's love
hi guys
i try to share with you some slides
from my presentation i think it will
help me to structure the skull
can you see it
yes yes we can
great
so
i want to start with a couple of words
about
my background because it's important
since 2006
we involved in multiple projects around
digital banking solutions
so we launched in 2006
the company which calls mfm
it's a big
aggregator of business traffic from
banks pension funds
[Music]
insurance companies
now it's
they aggregate more than 2 billion sms
per month they're working in russia and
other countries
so the next project was ida mobile where
we focus on developing white label
digital banks
our first client in 2011 was think of
bank
we did develop
ios and android
mobile bank for this
bank and after that uni credits as a
general concrete bank more than 25
future dell banks are working on our
white label solutions
uh
later we launched our own
new bank which
calls instabank
and after three and a half
years of operations i moved from
traditional finance to
crypto so
since 2017
i'm working on project which calls
trasta rasta.com
this is a solution which combines
benefits of
different cryptocurrencies with
traditional payment infrastructure think
about trustwork
crypto debit card
definitely you know crypto.com wirex
paying so
the same service you can
get her with trustra and
the idea of launchpad
came to me
when we see the huge
demand of
listing different kind of tokens and to
provide them
crypto to fiat gateway and
later
wait a second
yes
so
and currently we face with booming of
personal investments and
defy markets and also we inspire of
a story of
axa infinity and mobox
currently we see that
several
similar
projects well-funded projects are
starting on this way and
we think what we can do
for it and
as ladies love said
current
currently everyone uh thinking about
[Music]
launch pads and tokenization as a
fundraising mechanism but
we focus on tokenization of existing
assets like in-game currencies
and
[Music]
our value proposition
divided for
two directions the first one
we can help
different projects to
be funded through
tokenization but
the main idea of 40-foot launchpad is to
provide trucking as a service for game
dev industry
and
our i think unique value proposition is
uh trustra and swipe looks so
like
these two projects uh the first one i
founded in 2017 and uh now trustra
operates in european economic area in 31
european countries we have more than uh
120 000
users
and swipe looks this is a project
which i
invested in
this is a b2b solution like
mercurio in the coin maybe you know it
so this is equipped to fiat gateway
for merchants
and
i think that we can use these two
products these two assets to
provide unique value proposition for our
projects so to start working with 40
food they automatically
have
the option to be listed in these two
cryptochild gateways
uh also the idea
for
promoting and
for marketing is to develop our own
social mining platform which we try to
acquire influencers and pay them in
tokens
in our project tokens which we are going
to launch
as i mentioned before we have two
directions
the first one
we are going to help to fundraise
[Music]
money
to
the new projects and in
this case we are going to
have uh like very typical monetization
like participation in
pre-sale
stage and
most of our competitors work in the same
way like dow maker so they don't charge
new projects
for consulting or
development so they
get some
liquidity on initial stage and
sell it after the
on the stage where
the token sale stage
so the same with us uh in this way we
are going to uh
make money on it and
but the uh main idea is to
recognize existing uh in-game currencies
and
this idea is much uh
interesting for us because in this case
we will get
pure uh
utility token nobody will say that this
is security so this is pure utility
token which
can be distributed free of charge
inside the game like uh
in game currency
and in this
option we are
going to
make money on commission on transaction
commission
we already have the first
like portfolio project which calls
investmaster this is a mobile first
game for crypt
for like
for people who are going to become an
investor so you have two options here so
you can choose
different kind of
shares or different kind of crypto
assets we provide real
market prices in this app and
we make
battles between two different person or
between
you and community so you can
develop your own investment portfolio
and stop a period of time like one hour
one week or one month
and
after this period of time
you will see who
make
more
percentage
money on
portfolio projects and
who make more so
so this is a way how to to define the
winner
and uh this game
is going to be launched from the
beginning of november
this year and this is the
first project where we're going to use
our mechanic of tokenization
in game currency
uh also
we have a lot of a lot of
big
projects where we know
founders or decision makers this is the
list of companies
where we have direct connect with the
brain
and
[Music]
this is the way how we're going to
develop our go to market strategy
so currently
we are in a custom development phase and
we try to receive feedback
and this feedback is really very
positive
as i mentioned before uh the idea is to
provide trucking as a service for
game dev companies
so currently based on our
customer development phase we can say
that these companies they extremely
focus on their existing business they
extremely focus on holding their
existing needs and
they also heard about axa infinity they
also
understand the potential of such a big
opportunity as a play to earn model
but they don't have enough time and
resources to understand better what does
it mean and how it will work
so our idea to
provide this token as a service model to
gain depth and
save their time and
help them to launch it
much faster and much easier
uh
good thing that
we have had a motion company so good
emotion that you
this is a big
outsourcing company in kiev and my wife
she's a co-founder of promotion
it means
that we can instantly
get
best developers in our projects and we
can
have unlimited
development resources so codemotion
it's top
rated upwork
developer so you can check they have
very big volumes
in ukraine and give their number
two or number three
i guess
and they also i i'm talking about upwork
the platform and
also they have very good reputation
there and
this uh
estimation
for
developing and launching mvp
for launchpad and social mining platform
so our idea is to receive
this amount of money as a grant from
blockchain
from freetown and
i think that in a couple of months
we couldn't be live
uh so we have two co-founders uh
uh dmitry vysovsky uh he's
working as the cto in this project and
uh
he's quite a famous guy because
currently
uh he made an exit from his uh
company profit era profiter this is a
big
like
data
analysis
company for
retailers and
fmcg market
he made a very good exit last year
and
he has strong experiencing
artificial with artificial intelligence
his data mining and
his data science
as i
mentioned before i'm a fintech
entrepreneur
i have
good track records
and
also
most not most but all previous projects
since 2006 was uh work from uh with
digital banking or theme tech sphere
uh
also uh andrea bramov
is also on this
call
uh he uh join us as a product owner and
currently
uh he helps us to
develop a
40-foot platform and
i think
andre could help me to answer your
questions
yes thank you guys yeah yeah maybe just
just comment so uh
really as a team of romance
has come to defy lines initially so uh
with a discussion about the potential
grant so we recommend them to
participate you know a
launch pad contest that we were
preparing at that time
so uh
and i really believe that it's a good
synergy between uh
between the teams
uh yeah so if you have any questions so
please raise your hands
guys we will be able to answer for sure
yes alexander
please alexander you're mute
ah sorry hello roman
um
thank you for your presentation um
i have a question i met only one time
worth entity in your presentation
for my opinion
game dev
and cryptocurrency in gaming
maybe it's equal or even more
possibility an opportunity to use entity
tokens uh through game on game
multiverse and maybe on this
second way
as usually
currency like uh
d3 or erc20 i mean
uh
fundable tokens
uh why and
what do you think in the future about
entity
cross gaming
crown fighter launch finding
i do understand my question yes a good
question
yes yes andrew may ask you to help me
yeah sure
hey everyone
regarding the nft tokens we
totally understand its potential at the
moment we are at the start of our path
of
building
uh the launch pad and currently we are
very excited with the play to earn boom
which as you may know
is currently happening
so
at the start i believe we will start
with the crowdfunding functions
but um
but nft marketplace and
nft integration to in-game
processes will be
definitely present in our roadmap
but it won't be i believe it won't be
the first step we need to take
okay thank you and for now can you give
some example for example one game
existing game and you
uh talk with them about use your
launchpad uh
for what reason for example they have in
gaming currency and you
said them that okay
uh let's it will be cryptocurrency and
you start use uh
this cryptocurrency how
uh in-game cards or what a launch pad
for what reason
yeah yeah you are absolutely right i
can't give you the exact uh exact titles
but our partner dmitry who is absent on
this call unfortunately
uh at the moment
he is
held in the customer development with
the
big and middle game game dev studios
like playwrights comma games and so on
and so on
and the use case
is the exact you've mentioned so they
have their own currency they have
their game launched and
uh
bringing some audience and we propose
them to tokenize their in-game currency
and make it digital asset
so big companies they are waiting for
good examples good use cases
to follow
and
currently we focus on
small
projects like
investmaster
who wants to
launch the game
with existing talking
definitely
playrix will wait for a while
we'll check
how it works
and
i think that we already have
success stories like ax infinity
who do it
and
it's a matter of time when we
see maybe next year the boom of
transformation from uh
existing in-game currency to tokenized
game currency
also
maybe
you checked the
last news about apple so they
have to
[Music]
after the
decision of the core
they have to allowed
uh
projects with cryptocurrencies
to use crypto
in in
the
in-app
crypto
what's the biggest challenge
you see in
this
idea
i see at least two challenges it's just
about gaming monetization and how we
will do after that they stay
cryptocurrency use cryptocurrency for me
it's a little bit harder
uh to do monetization for game and sex
the second challenge it's
uh payment for transaction for guess
if when we use inside of game uh
cryptocurrency
uh on all blockchain it's pay for gas or
the fees
what challenge did you see in this
business for me it's big to challenge at
least
uh in fact
roman do you mind if i answer the
question yes sure
go ahead okay
uh
so the challenges
you've mentioned they are already
sold by a couple of games
that already utilize platoon model for
instance qinzi
arena
and
a couple of others that are being
launched right now
so
uh
these are no big deals at least as we
see it now we may be wrong
you know
um
the biggest challenge i see but it's
from the business perspective not from
the technical one
the biggest challenge is to
you know find the first
uh
game from the
big game game industry
who
who would like to
tokenize its game
and after that it will be much easier to
find
projects to who would like to work this
way
yes exactly but we have one
already yeah thank you for your answer
thank you
i have a question uh
so you want to bring the in-game
currency outside of a game
to
crypto infrastructure but
who would buy it and for what reason
you basically you know if it's an
in-game currency it's used by gamers
inside the game when you bring it out
what's the purpose
i mean it doesn't have any use case
outside of the game
what would be the purpose for for people
to buy it at all i of course
a lot of players would want to sell it
you know to
to basically get uh you know fiat
currency for it but who would buy it
it's about monetization
we already seen a lot of use cases where
in-game assets try to
solve in the real world for real money
without any tokens
and
i think
it's a question of amount of liquidity
in this game so
think about
like airplane
miles
like a airflow miles
so you can use this uh
um
mile to upgrade your
ticket but also you can
book a hotel or use it in a different
way the so this is the question of time
and uh the amount of liquidity in game
liquidity
but what would be what would be the use
case with air miles
you know you have a party that accepts
these miles uh in exchange for uh
discount for a ticket
uh what what kind of use case do you see
for uh
let's be very specific like uh
what kind of use case do you see
[Music]
you you you can uh see war gaming uh
industry and uh
you can
buy different kind of uh
in-game assets uh in real world
the same mechanics so
why
do you need to
spend time to
develop your profile
in a game when you can buy it
and
this is the case
another
sorry roman another case is
that we want to make the games
uh
current i don't know classic mobile
games
do not allow you to
earn money
while a play-to-own model
allows
gamers to earn money to earn crypto and
withdraw it
so it's
uh
the the question you ask it's the basic
demand question
so if the gamers
will be able to earn on crypto they will
they definitely want to buy more of it
and
uh one more import important notice is
that
current in-game assets
or in-game currency the games have
do not have to be converted one to one
ratio to
the creator
to the token they will launch with us
so it should not be one-to-one ratio and
it doesn't mean that
the demand will be zero
and the demand
always come from the new players in
every area in the industry but if you if
you want to convert
existing game
strategy to play to earn strategy it's
one thing
but but
this is like different business but if
you just if you just tokenize uh a
in-game currency
that doesn't create
because this the play play
foreign model uh it's it's very simple
to understand how it works
and why it works but uh
what you are doing is a little bit
different
i think i think you you kind of missing
that some parts to your strategy
in my humble opinion
of course i believe we are not since uh
the thing we propose it's a joint task
between the game and our launch part
so we give the payment infrastructure
and tokenization
procedure
and they will have to develop in-game
mechanics so we won't develop in game
mechanics play to earn
mechanics
for them
this is
their business and this is their
obligation to do this
our obligation is to launch the token
and
provide liquidity and give them the
payment infrastructure
so it's not
the one it's not one business it's two
businesses and they are separate
but providing liquidity would be would
be a challenge
it looks
the way it looks to me right now
i believe we can discuss it in chat
later on yeah yeah absolutely yeah
because we are already out of schedule
so
yeah
sorry
one last remark please please i will
share with you some examples of how it
is already done
uh in some gay play to own games so
it will be easier to understand
yes better to use existing use cases the
based on
the results of our customer development
phase we see that
it's quite understandable and
i guess
game companies they're waiting for such
a solution
because it's quite simple and the token
is a service it's
[Music]
what exactly we can offer them
okay
yes thank you guys uh let me just uh let
one last question so from azor and uh we
already need to rope up actually
yeah
it's too interesting to discuss so uh
guys don't want to let you go
yeah it's a very interesting topic
really um just one quick question for
you guys um andrei drummond how many
hours a week do you play games
[Music]
honestly i'm not playing games
i do financial services and
i'm staying on like
payment
and
if you had to
crypto exchange
yes yeah thank you very much no more
questions or rahman is doing business
and i'm playing games
so
he's paid to play games yes
yeah yeah i
i have two colleagues who are
very experienced in this area
so we divide our expertise for two parts
andrew
yeah platoon really catched me so i play
a couple of
the games and do it rather regularly
okay thank you thank you guys so uh
on this uh
good question so i have to wrap up our
discussion so thank you guys really for
coming to us and
uh we had so few time to discuss and it
was one of the most interesting uh
meetings in my personal opinion
so uh yeah so if you guys have some
other questions to ramana and andrew so
please feel free to ask in the default
chat so they are there so and just ping
them and ask your questions and uh by
the way uh what i wanted to say is that
you see how differently you can
approach the launchpad
question that's why i deliberately
wanted to see them at our default call
because the guys are building the
launchpad specifically for the gaming
projects
and
you could think about
all different applications of different
launchpads for different industries even
for real products uh maybe create kind
of kickstarter for real products on the
free tone network so it will be also
really really some something fascinating
uh yeah so
i thank you everyone for coming and i'm
really sad to wrap up this meeting but
we have to do this so and see you next
week at the same time
in the default chat and our weekly
device call
so i wish you a pleasant weekend and
say goodbye
bye bye
thank you guys thank you for inviting us
bye
