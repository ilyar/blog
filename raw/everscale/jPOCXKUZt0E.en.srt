so uh just to make a long story short so
 

245
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,350
so uh just to make a long story short so
uh i will not read out the whole

246
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
uh i will not read out the whole
 

247
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,550
uh i will not read out the whole
document so uh it will be shared right

248
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
document so uh it will be shared right
 

249
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,150
document so uh it will be shared right
after that if i call

250
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
after that if i call
 

251
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,670
after that if i call
um

252
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
um
 

253
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,069
um
there are some conditions actually uh

254
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
there are some conditions actually uh
 

255
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,430
there are some conditions actually uh
for for a project to appear in the

256
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,440
for for a project to appear in the
 

257
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,829
for for a project to appear in the
official list

258
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:38,839
official list
 

259
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,230
official list
uh we the least will be limited so there

260
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
uh we the least will be limited so there
 

261
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,269
uh we the least will be limited so there
will be

262
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:43,279
will be
 

263
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,030
will be
no more than uh 50 uh projects at at

264
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
no more than uh 50 uh projects at at
 

265
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,110
no more than uh 50 uh projects at at
that time so this is pretty pretty

266
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,120
that time so this is pretty pretty
 

267
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,590
that time so this is pretty pretty
similar to what uni swap does

268
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600
similar to what uni swap does
 

269
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,990
similar to what uni swap does
and we are gradually moving towards uh

270
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
and we are gradually moving towards uh
 

271
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,749
and we are gradually moving towards uh
having a fully scalable dow photon swap

272
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:57,759
having a fully scalable dow photon swap
 

273
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,670
having a fully scalable dow photon swap
that will uh later uh take decisions on

274
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
that will uh later uh take decisions on
 

275
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,310
that will uh later uh take decisions on
which project to write list which one uh

276
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
which project to write list which one uh
 

277
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,189
which project to write list which one uh
not

278
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
not
 

279
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,670
not
uh so uh that means that the room is

280
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
uh so uh that means that the room is
 

281
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,310
uh so uh that means that the room is
limited actually in this list and uh

282
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
limited actually in this list and uh
 

283
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,550
limited actually in this list and uh
you will need to comply with certain

okay i think that's the kind of probably

1002
00:30:58,549 --> 00:30:58,559
okay i think that's the kind of probably

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,630
right so we create a locker contract
burn our contract that burner contract

1008
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:06,640
burn our contract that burner contract
 

1009
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,110
burn our contract that burner contract
and and we publish the code should be

1010
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,120
and and we publish the code should be
 

1011
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,990
and and we publish the code should be
really simple everyone could see that

1012
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,000
really simple everyone could see that
 

1013
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,350
really simple everyone could see that
and we deploy this code

1014
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:15,360
and we deploy this code
 

1015
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,350

you can
i don't know play with it with the code

1022
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:23,679
i don't know play with it with the code
 

1023
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,190
i don't know play with it with the code
to make a hash like i don't know nicer

1027
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,630

yeah because i will ask the question i

1028
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:32,640
yeah because i will ask the question i
 

1029
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,149
yeah because i will ask the question i
will answer the question why not just

1030
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:34,159
will answer the question why not just
 

1031
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,950
will answer the question why not just
simply to send it to zeros well because

it will be much harder to prove

1046
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:51,200
it will be much harder to prove
 

1047
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,870
it will be much harder to prove
that this is impossible because like you

but you know um
 

1061
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,110
but you know um
yeah here

1062
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,120
yeah here
 

1063
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,950
yeah here
this one is much clearer because there

1064
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:08,960
this one is much clearer because there
 

1065
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,110
this one is much clearer because there
here's the code read the code

1066

here's the code read the code
 

1067
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,110
here's the code read the code
that that's that's the address that's

1068
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,120
that that's that's the address that's
 

1069

our
of our project by coinmarketcap so that

1172
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:07,279
of our project by coinmarketcap so that
 

1173
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,869
of our project by coinmarketcap so that
was a challenge

1174
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:08,879
was a challenge
 

1175
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,589
was a challenge
uh so yeah the answer is uh uh until the

1176
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:11,599
uh so yeah the answer is uh uh until the
 

1177
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,750
uh so yeah the answer is uh uh until the
end of next year

1178
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:13,760
end of next year
 

1179

free free tone um
that actually

1186
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:20,639
that actually
 

1187
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,750
that actually
really depends uh on

1188
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:23,760
really depends uh on
 

1189
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,710
really depends uh on
uh on the project itself so on how they

1190
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:26,720
uh on the project itself so on how they
 

1191
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,230
uh on the project itself so on how they
perceive the network

1192
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:28,240
perceive the network
 

1193
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,950
perceive the network
but typically when we uh are doing the

1194
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:30,960
but typically when we uh are doing the
 

1195
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,190

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,069

about the uh hot

1198
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:38,079
about the uh hot
 

1199
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,270
about the uh hot
hot features of friton named like this

1200

hot features of friton named like this
 

1201
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,990
hot features of friton named like this
so i mean the speed and low gas fees and

1202
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:44,000
so i mean the speed and low gas fees and
 

1203
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,829
so i mean the speed and low gas fees and
also scalability

1204
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:45,839
also scalability
 

1205
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,270
also scalability
and all other things that we put in

1206
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:49,280

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,630
of the bridge but it's
a document that concentrates on how the

1374
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:06,640
a document that concentrates on how the
 

1375
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,630
a document that concentrates on how the
breach works and and why

1376
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:08,640
breach works and and why
 

1377
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,750
breach works and and why
uh

1378
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:09,760
uh
 

1379
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,109
uh
it it will be success successful and uh

1380
00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:13,119
it it will be success successful and uh
 

1381
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,829
it it will be success successful and uh
it also contains some uh

1382
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:15,839
it also contains some uh
 

1383
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,990
it also contains some uh
highlights on how the economical system

1384
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,000
highlights on how the economical system
 

1385
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,950
highlights on how the economical system
works so

1386
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:18,960
works so
 

1387
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,829
works so
i think that stephan shared with you

1388
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:21,839
i think that stephan shared with you
 

1389
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,510
i think that stephan shared with you
uh almost

1390
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:23,520
uh almost
 

1391
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,150
uh almost
everything uh that is that is crucial

1392
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,160
everything uh that is that is crucial
 

1393
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,550
everything uh that is that is crucial
and some things are coming so i'll just

1394
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:28,560
and some things are coming so i'll just
 

1395
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,470
and some things are coming so i'll just
keep them secret for now because

1396
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:30,480
keep them secret for now because
 

1397
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,910
keep them secret for now because
uh they will

1398
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:31,920
uh they will
 

1399
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,109
uh they will
just

1400
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:33,119
just
 

1401
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:33,990
just
be

1402
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,000
be
 

1403
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,870
be
something that no one has done before so

1404
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:36,880
something that no one has done before so
 

1405
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,230
something that no one has done before so
and

1406
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:38,240
and
 

1407
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,990
and
they think maybe successful maybe not

1408
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,000
they think maybe successful maybe not
 

1409
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,630
they think maybe successful maybe not
but at least we believe that it will be

1410
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:42,640
but at least we believe that it will be
 

1411
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,030
but at least we believe that it will be
a really good solution as it can be used

1412
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,040
a really good solution as it can be used
 

1413
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,390
a really good solution as it can be used
uh by other projects

1414
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:48,400
uh by other projects
 

1415
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,030
uh by other projects
uh in the year's perspective what would

1416
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,040
uh in the year's perspective what would
 

1417
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,510
uh in the year's perspective what would
be more profitable uh bridge taking of

1418
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:53,520
be more profitable uh bridge taking of
 

1419
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,349
be more profitable uh bridge taking of
farming and bridge pairs so we're not

1420
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:55,359
farming and bridge pairs so we're not
 

1421
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,990
farming and bridge pairs so we're not
giving investment advice sorry guys

1422
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,000
giving investment advice sorry guys
 

1423
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,710

we cannot recommend you anything so just

1424
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:00,720
we cannot recommend you anything so just
 

1425
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,230
we cannot recommend you anything so just

1427
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,230
uh educate
in terms of financials and

1428
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:04,240
in terms of financials and
 

1429

yeah we cannot and will not
 

1435
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,550
yeah we cannot and will not

uh affect your
your decision in terms of investments

1440
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:17,760
your decision in terms of investments
 

1441
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,790
your decision in terms of investments
uh explain what kind of stupid mechanics

1442
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:20,800
uh explain what kind of stupid mechanics
 

1443
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,910
uh explain what kind of stupid mechanics
tip three is why it turns out that each

1444
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:23,920
tip three is why it turns out that each
 

1445
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,310
tip three is why it turns out that each
project has has its own tip three how it

1446
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:26,320
project has has its own tip three how it
 

1447
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,349
project has has its own tip three how it
works

1448
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:27,359
works
 

1449
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,069
works
isn't this a problem well uh

1450
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:30,079
isn't this a problem well uh
 

1451
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,190
isn't this a problem well uh
to say uh and comment on that yeah

1452
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200
to say uh and comment on that yeah
 

1453
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,310
to say uh and comment on that yeah
i i will give you

1454
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,320
i i will give you
 

1455
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,190
i i will give you
sure

1456
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,200
sure
 

1457
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,589
sure
so uh actually uh

1458
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:37,599
so uh actually uh
 

1459
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,990
so uh actually uh
we are being born currently so we are

1460
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,000
we are being born currently so we are
 

1461
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,670
we are being born currently so we are
not the project that has a solid

1462
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:41,680
not the project that has a solid
 

1463
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,990
not the project that has a solid
background already and thousands of

1464
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,000
background already and thousands of
 

1465
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,950
background already and thousands of
projects launched and whatever so uh no

1466
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:46,960
projects launched and whatever so uh no
 

1467
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,470
projects launched and whatever so uh no
one says that

1468
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:48,480
one says that
 

1469
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,470
one says that
this or that implementation of tip three

1470
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:50,480
this or that implementation of tip three
 

1471
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,270
this or that implementation of tip three
is

1472
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:51,280
is
 

1473
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,470
is
the most rightful one

1474
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:54,480
the most rightful one
 

1475
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,430
the most rightful one
each one implementation has some

1476
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:57,440
each one implementation has some
 

1477
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,150
each one implementation has some
rationale behind it so uh

1478
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:00,160
rationale behind it so uh
 

1479
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,870
rationale behind it so uh
in roxas for example so uh our

1480
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:02,880
in roxas for example so uh our
 

1481
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,349
in roxas for example so uh our
implementation of t3

1482
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:05,359
implementation of t3
 

1483
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,829
implementation of t3
was mainly

1484
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:08,839

 

1485
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,069

born together with the breach so and the

1486
00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:12,079
born together with the breach so and the
 

1487
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,470
born together with the breach so and the
requirements of the breach to function

1488
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:14,480
requirements of the breach to function
 

1489
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,390
requirements of the breach to function
and consequently when we were building

1490
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:16,400
and consequently when we were building
 

1491
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,950
and consequently when we were building
town swap as well uh so we

1492
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:18,960
town swap as well uh so we
 

1493
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,630
town swap as well uh so we
added some extra features to to

1494
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:22,640
added some extra features to to
 

1495
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,270
added some extra features to to
to the standard like gas management or

1496
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:27,280
to the standard like gas management or
 

1497
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,829
to the standard like gas management or
wallet deployment in the process of

1498
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:29,839
wallet deployment in the process of
 

1499
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,390

talking transfer

1500
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:32,400
talking transfer
 

1501
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,390
talking transfer
just because

1502
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:34,400
just because
 

1503
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,190
just because
we made thousands and tens of thousands

1504
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:37,200
we made thousands and tens of thousands
 

1505
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,150
we made thousands and tens of thousands
of different tests and we

1506
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,160
of different tests and we
 

1507
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,630
of different tests and we
personally met uh certain problems with

1508
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:42,640
personally met uh certain problems with
 

1509
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,510
personally met uh certain problems with
using just euro vanilla uh tip three

1510
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:45,520
using just euro vanilla uh tip three
 

1511
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,349
using just euro vanilla uh tip three
specifications that was proposed by

1512
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:47,359
specifications that was proposed by
 

1513
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,309
specifications that was proposed by
media so uh that doesn't mean that uh

1514
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:50,319
media so uh that doesn't mean that uh
 

1515
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,349
media so uh that doesn't mean that uh
other implementations are good or bad

1516
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:53,359
other implementations are good or bad
 

1517
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,150
other implementations are good or bad
so uh they are just using different

1518
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:56,160
so uh they are just using different
 

1519
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,950
so uh they are just using different
products and uh one day probably so we

1520
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:58,960
products and uh one day probably so we
 

1521
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,750
products and uh one day probably so we
will just try to unify them but until

1522
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:01,760
will just try to unify them but until
 

1523
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,990
will just try to unify them but until
then we won't

1524
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,000

 

1525
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,470

please just remember this is a this is a

1526
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:10,480
please just remember this is a this is a
 

1527
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,309
please just remember this is a this is a
distributed programming paradigm in

1528
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:12,319
distributed programming paradigm in
 

1529
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,710
distributed programming paradigm in
which yeah the whole point of tip three

1530
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:14,720
which yeah the whole point of tip three
 

1531
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,390
which yeah the whole point of tip three
is that it's a distributed token it

1532
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:16,400
is that it's a distributed token it
 

1533
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,150
is that it's a distributed token it
doesn't have a hash map

1534
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,160
doesn't have a hash map
 

1535
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,470
doesn't have a hash map
of the owners and that means that the

1536
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:20,480
of the owners and that means that the
 

1537
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,670
of the owners and that means that the
contract is very tiny and they should be

1538
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:23,680
contract is very tiny and they should be
 

1539
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,710
contract is very tiny and they should be
tiny

1540
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:24,720
tiny
 

1541
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,150

a lot of additional features on top of

1546
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:31,440
a lot of additional features on top of
 

1547
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,790
a lot of additional features on top of
the the tip3 contract itself and these

1548
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:34,800
the the tip3 contract itself and these
 

1549
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,069
the the tip3 contract itself and these

they

1552
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:37,119
they
 

1553
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,589
they
require separate interfaces right so

1554
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:39,599
require separate interfaces right so
 

1555
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,670
require separate interfaces right so
what you would do in ethereum you would

1556
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:41,680
what you would do in ethereum you would
 

1557
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,470
what you would do in ethereum you would
create like an a hash map and then just

1558
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:44,480
create like an a hash map and then just
 

1559
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,550
create like an a hash map and then just
add all the interfaces you would

1560
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:46,560
add all the interfaces you would
 

1561
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,950
add all the interfaces you would

possibly need to that this is impossible
 

1563
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,349
possibly need to that this is impossible
to do because in that

1564
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:51,359
to do because in that
 

1565
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,150
to do because in that
what that will create a monstrous uh tip

1566
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:54,160
what that will create a monstrous uh tip
 

1567
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,150
what that will create a monstrous uh tip

you want to deploy this contract fast
and not create any funky mechanism of

1586
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,040
and not create any funky mechanism of
 

1587
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,710
and not create any funky mechanism of

deploying and then setting the code and
 

1589
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,309

00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:18,319
then adding to that
 

1591
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,390
then adding to that
which is a nightmare by itself you just

1592
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:20,400
which is a nightmare by itself you just
 

1593
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,710
which is a nightmare by itself you just
don't do that in the point is that we

1594
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:22,720
don't do that in the point is that we
 

1595
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,670
don't do that in the point is that we
don't need a unified standard

1596
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:25,680
don't need a unified standard
 

1597
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,190
don't need a unified standard
because

1598
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:27,200
because
 

1599
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,670
because
because there is no problem in having

1600
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:29,680
because there is no problem in having
 

1601
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,190

creating you you create a tip three

1602
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:31,200
creating you you create a tip three
 

1603
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,950
creating you you create a tip three
token for your project for example in

flex in breach it was one thing that

1606
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:35,359
flex in breach it was one thing that
 

1607
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,990
flex in breach it was one thing that
proxies needed to add like in interfaces

1608
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,000
proxies needed to add like in interfaces
 

1609
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,589
proxies needed to add like in interfaces
and then flex is completely other thing

1610
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:39,599
and then flex is completely other thing
 

1611
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,829
and then flex is completely other thing
that we needed to add and we we choose

1612
00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:41,839
that we needed to add and we we choose
 

1613
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,349
that we needed to add and we we choose
to add that and drop some other

1614
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:43,359
to add that and drop some other
 

1615
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,510
to add that and drop some other
interfaces so it will be tiny contract

1616
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:45,520
interfaces so it will be tiny contract
 

1617
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,950
interfaces so it will be tiny contract
in the gas payment for that will be

1618
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:46,960
in the gas payment for that will be
 

1619
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,790
in the gas payment for that will be
small and the deployment will be in one

1620
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:48,800
small and the deployment will be in one
 

1621
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,870
small and the deployment will be in one
message and so on and so forth the same

1622
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:50,880
message and so on and so forth the same
 

1623
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,270
message and so on and so forth the same
thing goes for every project that you

1624
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:53,280
thing goes for every project that you
 

1625
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,990
thing goes for every project that you
you want to use tip three

1626
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,000
you want to use tip three
 

1627
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,270
you want to use tip three
so

1628
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:57,280
so
 

1629
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,150
so
tip 3 is not a standard in this

1630
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:00,160
tip 3 is not a standard in this
 

1631
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,589
tip 3 is not a standard in this
normal like in the ethereum kind of way

1632
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:03,599
normal like in the ethereum kind of way
 

1633
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,309
normal like in the ethereum kind of way
it is a it is a way to program and you

1634
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:06,319
it is a it is a way to program and you
 

1635
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,230
it is a it is a way to program and you
can add interfaces and you need to

1636
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:08,240
can add interfaces and you need to
 

1637
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,230
can add interfaces and you need to
describe these interfaces in the tip 3

1638
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:10,240
describe these interfaces in the tip 3
 

1639
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,670
describe these interfaces in the tip 3
documentation

1640
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:11,680
documentation
 

1641
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,349
documentation
but you don't need to actually have all

1642
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:13,359
but you don't need to actually have all
 

1643
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,309
but you don't need to actually have all
the

1644
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:14,319
the
 

1645
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,390
the
tokens to have the same interface so how

1646
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:16,400
tokens to have the same interface so how
 

1647
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,230
tokens to have the same interface so how
do they talk to each other well it's

1648
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:18,240
do they talk to each other well it's
 

1649
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,309
do they talk to each other well it's
very simple through wrappers and it's

1650
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:20,319
very simple through wrappers and it's
 

1651
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,470
very simple through wrappers and it's
really simple to do

1652
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:22,480
really simple to do
 

1653
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,550
really simple to do
and it's there is no problem to take one

1654
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:26,560
and it's there is no problem to take one
 

1655
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,109
and it's there is no problem to take one
token and one in the bridge talking and

1656
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:29,119
token and one in the bridge talking and
 

1657
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,589
token and one in the bridge talking and
make it if and make it tradable on flex

1658
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:31,599
make it if and make it tradable on flex
 

1659
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,430
make it if and make it tradable on flex
and of course we

1660
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:33,440
and of course we
 

1661
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,030
and of course we
we already have that contract written so

1662
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:35,040
we already have that contract written so
 

1663
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,870
we already have that contract written so
we will demonstrate it when the flex

1664
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:36,880
we will demonstrate it when the flex
 

1665
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,670
we will demonstrate it when the flex
will go out it will trade

1666
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:39,680
will go out it will trade
 

1667
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,870
will go out it will trade
tokens which which you post on swap or

1668
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:42,880
tokens which which you post on swap or
 

1669
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,270
tokens which which you post on swap or
in breach no problem

1670
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:45,280
in breach no problem
 

1671
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,190
in breach no problem
because when you want to do that you

1672
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:47,200
because when you want to do that you
 

1673
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,950
because when you want to do that you
just send one message to the contract it

1674
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:48,960
just send one message to the contract it
 

1675
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,790
just send one message to the contract it
will wrap one talk and give you another

1676
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:50,800
will wrap one talk and give you another
 

1677
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,790
will wrap one talk and give you another
deploy the pair that's it

1678
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:52,800
deploy the pair that's it
 

1679
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,510
deploy the pair that's it
because the gas fees are so small in

1680
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:55,520
because the gas fees are so small in
 

1681
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,470
because the gas fees are so small in
freetown there is simply no difference

1682
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:58,480
freetown there is simply no difference
 

1683
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,910
freetown there is simply no difference
and it would be it's actually

1684
00:43:59,910 --> 00:43:59,920
and it would be it's actually
 

1685
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,750
and it would be it's actually
economically more feasible to do is

1686
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:01,760
economically more feasible to do is
 

1687
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,670
economically more feasible to do is
through the wrapper if you collect and

1688
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:03,680
through the wrapper if you collect and
 

1689
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,670
through the wrapper if you collect and
you combine all the fees

1690
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:05,680
you combine all the fees
 

1691
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,750
you combine all the fees
then the fees that your huge hashmap

1692
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:07,760
then the fees that your huge hashmap
 

1693
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,349
then the fees that your huge hashmap
with all that were hashmap all the

1694
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:09,359
with all that were hashmap all the
 

1695
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,950
with all that were hashmap all the
contract with all the interfaces would

1696
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:10,960
contract with all the interfaces would
 

1697
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,829
contract with all the interfaces would
pay because for every interface you pay

1698
00:44:13,829 --> 00:44:13,839
pay because for every interface you pay
 

1699
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,829
pay because for every interface you pay
right because you store them

1700
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:15,839
right because you store them
 

1701
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,349
right because you store them
right so

1702
00:44:17,349 --> 00:44:17,359
right so
 

1703
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,630
right so
so if you combine all these fees

1704
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:18,640
so if you combine all these fees
 

1705

the so from every perspective you look
 

1711
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,430
the so from every perspective you look
at this in the sharded architecture like

1712
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:27,440
at this in the sharded architecture like
 

1713
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,550
at this in the sharded architecture like
friton if you wanted to scale infinitely

want to be specific now for our project

1764
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:32,480
want to be specific now for our project
 

1765
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,829
want to be specific now for our project
which is a tango

1766
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:33,839
which is a tango
 

1767
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,870
which is a tango
and we're trying to issue the our

1768
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:36,880
and we're trying to issue the our
 

1769
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,150
and we're trying to issue the our
in-game token

and the thing says according to media
then we basically can just write a

1774
00:45:42,069 --> 00:45:42,079
then we basically can just write a
 

1775
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,069
then we basically can just write a
contract based on

1776
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:44,079
contract based on
 

1777
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,230
contract based on
the existing tip three

1778
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:46,240
the existing tip three
 

1779
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,630
the existing tip three
uh standards right and when the flex is

uh standards right and when the flex is
 

1781
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,589
uh standards right and when the flex is
ready then we can basically just write a

1782
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:51,599
ready then we can basically just write a
 

1783
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,589
ready then we can basically just write a
wrapper on top of it

1784
00:45:53,589 --> 00:45:53,599
wrapper on top of it
 

1785
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,750
wrapper on top of it
yeah exactly exactly

1786
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:55,760
yeah exactly exactly
 

1787
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,270
yeah exactly exactly
if i'm the strong media already has the

1788
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:57,280
if i'm the strong media already has the
 

1789
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,309
if i'm the strong media already has the
rubber from

1790
