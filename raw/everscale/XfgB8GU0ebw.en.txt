hello guys
hi guys
hi everyone
hello everyone
okay traditional let's wait for a minute
okay let's start so welcome everyone in
our 39th weekly governance call of the
defy group for the return
so we have not so many news to discuss
today but yet they are very very
important
so let's start uh
from the contest update so uh we have
launched a number of uh good contests
recently so uh some of you may know
about this so there is a famous uh
defy.gov.3.org
interface where you can find all the
contests if you didn't didn't know
actually
we have uh one contest that had to be
prolonged due to very low juris
efficiency so it was a self-sovereign
identity framework
uh and i'm really really disappointed
with it because
it was
announced far in advance and there are
only four works that were submitted to
this contest uh so
yeah uh i i really really disappointed
about jurors
they didn't pay uh enough attention to
this and we didn't collect the quorum
for this
now the contest is prolonged for a few
more days to to give a chance to vote to
those who
ignored it uh
at the beginning so i hope that they
will do their duty
next
is the distributed validator oracle
contest uh that i don't see any
submission yet so i only received the
announcement from liven
that he would like to participate but he
needs some extra time
and personally
i'm i'm really surprised because at
least i'm i was sure that tom labs team
will also participate with a not
implementation
but
this morning i discovered they will not
participate so uh that's very weird for
me
uh
well um it's i can comment i mean we
obviously didn't have time to do that
okay we are
completely overloaded
uh right now
with the rust contrast
with everything
right okay
yeah
this this actually raises the discussion
again about how many contests device
upgrades actually can host
simultaneously because you remember that
initially we
were
delay in some contests to let different
teams to participate and
now i feel that we should go back to
this practice because otherwise there
are too many events and too few commands
to a few teams who can participate in
these contests
and
maybe it's not good for
such a complex area as sd5 to host
several a big contest simultaneously
uh
or need more teams
yes and
i i personally in a constant search for
such teams
however so
it's not not easy actually to find ones
so we are in the discussion for example
with several lending protocols from from
ethereum
to invite them for
participation in the lending contest or
even
simply discuss the transfer of these
solutions to the free tone natively
and
yeah so we have reached such agreement
only with stable coin protocols for the
moment but it's the beginning
yet it's not the the war of one one
warrior you know so each of us should
should
try to attract more more teams here
because uh
it will benefit from it
as a whole please don't don't hesitate
there are
enough uh topics enough contests to to
participate for all of us and uh if you
have someone who you believe
is capable enough to deliver certain
results
so please invite them here
we are always welcome
so speaking about the validator oracle
contest
i think we have no other choice than to
prolong this uh or postpone it for some
time um
we will be able to participate uh only
after us cup finishes which is one month
so okay like if you
postpone it if you consider postponing
that then you know
something like almost sounds good
actually uh uh oracle implementation was
uh crucial for the stablecoin contest uh
and also for the lending cost contest uh
lending implementation that's why i
didn't uh actually post something uh for
the draft of the linux
protocol because there is absolutely no
sense doing this now and um
yeah so let's discuss uh actually for
if we should delay this contest and uh
for what period of time so i i heard two
opinions now so one from ivan
who have requested a couple more weeks
another one from italy now so that it
should be delayed until august
uh
yeah
let me speak some something yes please
yes i propose continue oracle contests
for
one maybe more months because we need
a
good robust oracle for ecosystem from
frontal website
but
about stablecoin and etc i think we can
launch it and
people who will who will create solution
can use chain link
for speed because a lot of different
protocols uh
we're using channeling
oracles and
and i think we can use to because uh
blockchain
[Music]
is who has any issues
okay your internet sucks
sorry
switch the video off please because i
don't hear half of your words
yeah
okay in this case uh
the question is uh how we should connect
to chain link so uh will be something
some kind of adapter to chain link from
ethereum site
or will be the off chain uh
parser
of chain part that will fit the data
from from ethereum directly to
freetown sites so what do you think
i mean finally i see you
come on turn me on your camera
i don't hear you all muted
i'm a bit shy
or worries
i'm not the beautiful the most beautiful
man on the earth too you know so no no
no reason for shine
okay so in this case uh let's prolong
the oracle contest until the uh
until august
in this case i hope
there will be enough time for everyone
to participate
um
yeah so let's continue to the contest
update uh
for
st town uh tip3 implementation there are
25 days left and
there is one shitty submission already
there so let's uh
remember our famous friend who did this
in other contests
uh also uh we have launched the new
selection for jury uh 1.3 so please uh
also help me destroying distribution of
this news to across freetown and outside
of it because we need some competent
jurors
who are willing to
dedicate their time for assessing the
works that's submitted to the device of
governance and what's more important
there is there is currently
the proposal uh about the
amendment to the procedural remarks uh
which increases actually the reward for
jurors uh
to nine percent and for those
specifically for those jurors who will
be assessing all submissions in each
contest they will enjoy also one
additional percent of the price fund
that will be distributed amongst our
jurors so i hope this will help us to to
motivate
people more
and also the
southern force
stages of ethereum bridge combined
so it will be ending
by end of august so hopefully we will be
able to finish all the parts as well so
and
yeah so that's pretty about the contest
update
uh for stablecoin uh contests if i
remember it well uh
alexander so he's not with us today
because he has some internet connection
problems and uh vladimir uh
also he's not with us today so they
already have a good draft of the contest
so uh
in this case i will draft
i will post it for voting uh hopefully
today uh or maybe tomorrow so uh
and also
we will start this contest from from
monday because
we have already as you may have heard a
couple of agreements uh from uh
defy lines part with two stable coins
which are frags and stasis
so
which agreed uh to migrate
or raise a fork of the solution on
friton but it will take also some time
and uh having also some native uh native
stable coins is also is also interesting
and crucial for the free tone consistent
development
uh okay so that's it for contest updates
uh let's move to the discussion of the
polka dots that has stalled for a while
so guys are you here yes yes vladislav
we are here yes please please uh tell us
a bit more some updates about the
the destiny of the polkadot bridge so
what's going on
sure everyone good time of the day um
yes we came a long way in the
development process of the bridge and
the basic functionality in our opinion
is done in britain
it's about time to think about the
product and
it was all about it from the beginning
all the way uh we would like to take now
a short pause to do the necessary
research of the current state of the
polkadot ecosystem
and
we thought about the product in general
all the way um we came up with certain
criteria of the
product
it has to attract new users
into free tone community that
consequently will add the liquidity or
earn opportunity to current users
main reason um okay
yeah so
actually why yes why why and what and
what's happening now uh the main reason
uh why we do not have uh
uh a ready product at the moment let me
explain a little bit about this the main
reason is polka dot ecosystem
uh it did not have the ability to add
products into it up until uh
last week's
just now in the polka dot ecosystem
parachain auction we launched
on the canary network kusama at present
four slots were taken by the products
and
no one knew in advance no one knew what
those products will be
and that's the reason why we simply did
not have the opportunity uh before to
come up with a great product in advance
but yes
we have few ideas
but ideas are not enough we are looking
into power chain abilities
and uses interest from the polkadot side
because it's not only
it's not only about the idea it's also
about people's interests and it would be
great to have a product that would be
interesting on both sides to polka dot
users and of course the return users
uh and because we need to do this
research uh in a product we ask for this
short pose if it's possible
at the moment we estimate this pose as
about one month this will allow us to
come up with a valuable proposal to
flirt on community
if
anyone has a good idea in a community of
such product and it is technically
possible it's doable on the polka dot
network
uh
feel free to share it with everyone on
the telegram channel so we can discuss
the opportunities
that's where we are standing at the
moment
i'm sure
anyone that have questions or maybe some
yeah i actually heard that there were
actually two
power chains actually auctioned one is
karura
from pronounced right another one is uh
beam
and
if i understand it correctly so they
differ in the implementation of the
protein itself um but maybe you can
explain a bit more uh so
what's um
what's the difficulty uh from your
standpoint of integrating uh
your
polka dot uh endpoint to one of these
power chains so is it more about the
readiness of the ecosystem of these
power chains at first sight or maybe
there are some technical difficulties so
uh
yeah just give give some some advice
well it's actually from the both sides a
little bit from each one uh the polka
dot what what we are actually doing and
why we were waiting the first of all of
course we need to see where the people's
interests will go because now there are
four products four slots been taking
that's the latest news sort of
and uh
polkadot doesn't in the beginning the
technical problem or technical issue i
would say the polkadot doesn't have the
smart contracts by design itself
uh there is an ability to uh become a
power chain of course but uh because of
the high rivalry the parachain spots
cost too much uh we're talking about 32
33 million dollars
that's why we have decided to wait for
the generic products to be launched and
will give us the necessary ability to
build our products
uh based on generic ones
so
okay
okay yes
that's a piece from one side that we
uh cannot move on this uh this contest
because
of course having a working
end user product to the polka dots
would
be really great for the
media coverage and for the promoting
free tonic system but i agree that
there is no sense in doing the bridge to
nowhere so
we actually are doing bridges to help
liquidity flows and user flows
and if there is there is nothing on the
other side so
no sense to connect to the
dark hole thankfully thankfully it is
now so there is a possibility now
thankfully we have finished the basic
development by this time so it is i
think the timing is sort of not perfect
but very close to we're talking about
delay of one month which is it's not
great
uh but uh sometimes that happens
at the moment we have everything that
takes uh for us to come up with a great
product
i mean we have a few ideas but
talking about them now i think it's
pointless because while we're doing this
research i'm sure we come up with a few
more ideas that will be more relative to
the situation and the situation right
now is sort of very very hot on a polka
dot side
okay
okay guys do you have some questions to
to the winter's team
[Music]
like i
like maybe saying it the first time but
i have kind of dropped off architecture
of bitcoin bridge and it's relatively
easy yeah it's
it's kind of
the same as in ethereum relay old old
old contract so it's just based on
miracle proofs right
and
um
would you participate
in such a contest if it would be
proposed or do you have kind of capacity
um
can can i clarify the question are you
talking about will we come up with the
idea or will we participate in the next
stage
uh uh
are you are you still talking about
polkadot or is it no no no no no no no
it isn't bitcoin
um i'm sure
at the moment we are not planning to
participate in anything else but the
polka dot at this moment at this page
but uh i'm not so sure but brooks's team
might be interested in that in the
future i'm not sure
brock's team is a silver bullet for
everything i know
but i'm not sure if we have capacity
actually for the moment
at the moment we do not have the
necessary capacity to pull up uh the
both contracts i mean to pull up this
polka dot
side it would be great for us to finish
that off and you know do the great
product that will be interesting to have
two of those products at the same time
um yeah okay yeah you will fail both
right you will fail
yeah okay and uh
yeah same same regarding kind of broke
system capacity yeah i understand it
really well
but anyways
a draft
is already here with all the specs in
the descriptions kind of maybe a bit
unfinished but community helped me
polish it
when it
comes time so yeah just wanted to let
you know when kind of guys you're ready
just ping me and i'll kind of shoot and
we can move like to bitcoin because
bitcoin kind of it's really interesting
to lock
as collateral kind of
or not or not maybe i i don't know
vladislav doesn't make sense to bridge
with bitcoin
yes i think that uh the bridge to
bitcoin the native bridge is
the available one actually because
uh
as you can see and now uh there is
an opportunity to operate with robbed
btc on free tone but to do this you
first need to get this rob btc from
it's actually double bridging double
branching yeah yeah i mean direct bridge
which is of course is of course
important one but uh again um
as i told the last time so the main
problem is not to build the bridge
itself
is to find first of all people who will
build the bridge the reputable guys who
can uh who will be able to operate it
and maintain the due security
of funds
and uh the second part is of course
liquidity as you say but uh it will
follow if you have
well done solution audited by reputable
companies so
someone like opens up in ethereum i
don't know the names for bitcoin
unfortunately
well it's bitcoin core community
probably yeah
i just wanted to clarify kind of it
in this design i may be
again mistake but in
this design which i kind of came up with
it's it it really it doesn't require
kind of infrastructure because
um
you can write smart contracts on bitcoin
actually it's it's kind of tricky but
this one
they call scripts yeah yeah
and this script which is which i'm
thinking about is kind of
it's not really so hard so it just
locked lock funds and and the
the other side of the bridge contains on
chain code which will generate kind of
by by
byte code which will unlock it uh after
uh like to make back backwards swap so
um kind of
you need only to like securely store
private keys and relay
trunk proof
for transactions to build
the kind of connector
and wrapped wrap like btc here and there
so
do you have someone uh
from bitcoin core community so who who
can maybe come to our discussion here
and
uh with who we can discuss with the
possibility of writing such bridges
there is a email
from
from roger from roger where to my email
i can
put it in copy
but
it will not suit i ignore ignoring this
change
okay he's asking
from you some bitcoins here
to send to nigeria right absolutely a
nigerian prince yeah
okay so we have kind of alexandra which
have like photographs with reputable
people maybe he knows someone from
bitcoin
it's just kind of matter of shooting
it's a pr maybe so kind of it's another
kind of task not development related but
kind of business development so maybe
kind of i just wanted to launch a
discussion because like the solution i'm
close to the solution i can maybe share
it privately or publicly
after after maybe some time because i'm
now busy kind of so
kind of it's possible and it's it's not
really so hard to maintain the interest
trial will relay infrastructure and like
keeping no validators private keys
kind of it's a
i don't know what the reputation you
need to have you you put a stake and you
kind of take responsibility for it
and
yeah but i mean
uh all the bridges so they actually pass
pretty much the same stages so and down
part uh which uh
really operates this in the sterilized
fashion without the necessity to
refer to validator's
reputation
actually
is the one of the last points so first
you need to create the basic layer
learn how to transfer information from
one blockchain to another
and uh it's it's not that easy um
i would agree that
it it's a very easy so although we have
some uh some tool sets already developed
so we have at least two bridges uh with
two different concepts which are in some
fashion similar to each other and uh
differ depending on the other side
what's blockchain on the other side um
but mainly this is uh
this staging is done for a reason
and uh
if you want some capital to inflow from
from bitcoin uh through the bridge so
you must
assure this capital uh or capital owners
that this is safe first of all and this
is not not an easy part because uh we
have a lot of discussions with different
funds and uh
yeah it's it's always a very very tricky
tricky question so you need to prove
is it
tricky in technical terms like you need
to
like show a specification provide the
proof that uh absolutely yeah so big big
funds they they require it they have
their own
security guys who inspect
all this
audit results and
they want to look at the source code
and so on so forth to be sure that if
they would like to transfer i don't know
10 million bucks through the bridge so
it will be safe
yeah so and it will be interesting to
jump in the process but but maybe like a
little bit later i agree yeah
what i would do actually is try to
bring here some some representatives of
the bitcoin community um maybe from even
robbed vtc or nbtc
projects uh who can maybe
tell us a bit more about how they
operate the bridges or what difficulty
experience
and so on and so forth and maybe uh
it is it will be a good move to
ask them
to to
to build the bridge to the freetown site
as well well because they already have
the bitcoin apart development they will
build they will build another like half
custody how half we see to any kind kind
of solution because the currently
probability is is kind of like
partially centralized
yeah i know all the drawbacks of of the
random tc model that most of the nodes
are controlled by the same company
and so on and so forth but uh
still
i think that it's better to start from
something that's already proven uh
on the market
and then to to do everything from
scratch
because uh
reinventing the wheel is not always that
was the best approach
well
i i i expect
yeah comments on that like if you if
your will is in there isn't that
like horsepower and
then you invented the car you better
change the wheel i mean
i mean that at least the bitcoin part uh
that they did
is a nice one
i don't mean
yeah i don't mean that maybe you
understand
sorry maybe you technically understand
it but tvm kind of
storage model is based kind of on the on
three kind of data structure which
consists of like proofs
right and
like you can build native native bitcoin
transaction layout from inside tvm back
and forth
right
just need to know layout of bitcoin
transaction and and build the same thing
right inside tvm and parse that
like you that came from relay
right
not really
i don't think so
yeah because you you well you will need
you will need
um
like
all the
first of all you will need all the
cryptography second of all you basically
will need to create to like you will
need to write a lite client
to bitcoin as a smart contract
well yes uh sh 8 25
whatever it is natively on tvm and on
bitcoin both like it like we don't have
to keep shock we don't have so we can
like repeat it on ethereum but we have
like sha
we have hashing yeah but that's just
part of that right and medical proofs we
have them they are based basically on
passion
yeah i'm not sure like
if you can i'm not sure i'm not sure you
can
build the light client of ethereum on
using
uh bitcoin using
um
if you receive like if you receive well
first of all
first of all you will need to parse the
script right which is you will need to
emulate
the like the fourth
script language a little a little like
the interpretator i mean spv like build
built in spv
well again again you will need to parse
the script anyway whatever yes yes of
course so you will need to emulate the
script of the smart contract then then
you will need um
to
have a proof
right that the outputs that have been
sent to you are like the correct outputs
this is merkel prophet speaking on
how to like check the markup yes you
will need to check numerical proof
exactly like ethereum does that oh yeah
like bitcoin does that so yes
well if you you can do all that
but i'm not sure i'm not sure it's that
trivial like the fact that we have yeah
yeah it's based a lot of questions but
trees
uh that was really really interesting
thank you ivan
uh okay
okay
uh
yes thank you guys from winter steam uh
so we are waiting for for your research
then if you if it takes you
less than a month so just give give me a
sign and
please please
make a report on one of the whole calls
uh okay so uh
last but not least so we have
the dex stage two contest
ended as well
and
it seems to be legit
which is very good so it's a good quorum
is collected and
congrats uh
sway dev team so with the first place so
we will arrange the payout session uh i
think on monday uh when uh alexander
will come back
and we'll have some good internet
connection
um yeah and uh also uh guys from three
dev team uh asked me to discuss uh the
next stage of the dex contest so uh
please
yeah
hi everyone yeah thank you for con
congratulations of the team we were very
happy about that and we congratulate
other participants as well and thank you
for judging
yeah and uh for now we decided to
to start the
to start the work with the
document with the draft for the third
stage of dex implementation
and according to the documents which
were
in this first and second
parts
the third stage is complex automated
market maker mechanics mechanics
additional necessary improvements like
ue uix governance voting and or killed
in mechanics etc
yeah for
but uh we're not we started to work on
the document but we're not
quite sure what
what was meant to be complex automated
market makers mechanics
and
um
we we tried to
talk about it with vladimir maslikov
because he took
part
in
creating the first and second documents
and
we're not sure that
we can do this with our project
or or maybe anybody has like opinions
what what can be on in in this stage
uh because for us
we see
like more
efficient a way to use a third stage to
make the products
more popular profitable and more
interesting for future users
uh well that's what we wanted to discuss
uh because
uh also we have different kinds of
architectures
like
we what we have is different from what
flex has for example and we we wanted to
to talk to hear other opinions about uh
how other participants and how judges uh
here uh see the next
stage of the next the last stage of
dex implementation for sure it should be
about
interface
but what about the
the other parts because
we can offer what we see but maybe
somebody has any other opinions and uh
wants to announce it
okay thank you elena mita i think
the main thing is here is the question
to you so what will be the next stage
for the flex
for the flex well um we have we have
basically finished
um
we
so
like
the amm is there the complex mechanics i
don't know what it is but but
well our amm i think is is quite
quite fitting
towards that like is it to the complex
mechanics because you can create as many
amms you as you want you can launch them
with your different you know governance
tokens connected to flex and and like
you would with normal order book kind of
exchanges so you can totally emulate the
whole work of the financial market uh as
it is today without
being stuck with the one amm which is
the same as basically the the exchange
so um
so that's about the mm i don't know what
else to add uh here
yeah again i have no connect i don't
know i i wasn't participating in the
contest formulation so i have no idea
what what it really means yeah i think
that's it's it's not about um we should
not stick to the
preliminary warnings that were in the
previous stages because it was not clear
absolutely where this contest will go
and uh what will appear uh
after it's finished
so as maybe i will try to reformulate
the question so um
if for um
so
uh
now we have uh some working solutions
yeah so uh they are not ideal of course
but they uh they acquire quite decent
ones and uh
uh for the third stage
besides some interface improvements and
whatever so uh
we have two different models so the amm
based uh
exchanges and all the book based
exchange uh so what will be the uh
possible next stage for both types of
observers
well i think we need to i like it
doesn't matter uh in terms of like
amendments or not a mm because
both solutions provide at the end both
solutions provide some user experience
and they should include the automatic
market maker so and both of them are
providing that
now
we for example in terms of interfaces
you should be careful because we are not
going to make a
standalone web interface because it goes
against our ideology because it sucks
instead
it sucks because it sucks it literally
and because because it's centralized
because it's centralized and because
it's censored and because it's
controlled so
um
we will provide uh there is already a
graphs that added to surf browser hey
there
edit edit edit to serve browser so um
we will create an interface a totally
debug interface based based interface
for flex and there will be no other
interface
but if anyone would like to you know
build it they can do that of course it's
an open source so an open open
interface
other than that
i don't i don't have any comments like
basically so basically you're saying if
broxas wants to build ship please go
right
um anyone who wants to build anything
 or good please go i mean it's not
or good please go i mean it's not
i'm not i'm not giving i'm you know
web free that should be so um
wait let me finish so so that about the
interfaces now i think that we need to
find finalize all the solutions towards
some kind of you know
more or less
complete
user experience which will would should
include
like the governance tokens or
possibilities of governance tokens or
some example of how you can create the
governance tokens
um for for like to be like to have a
business model that could be sustainable
that kind of solutions all of them
yeah you need to present um
[Music]
wrappers if you need them like that
anyone can list what they can list and
these rules and these rules should be
discussed discussed meaning that somehow
the project should incorporate this
rules as a final solution right if i
want to add the token how should i do
that what the rules are for each
platform and uh and the you know
whatever
how to do that and be able to do that
um if the solution is saying that you
can do that of course like i don't know
but somehow the tokens should be listed
on this exchange so that should be part
of the solution correct
um
then in terms of interfaces again it
shouldn't shouldn't define the interface
it should just say what kind of
usability it should have so for example
should it support like should the
interface in general support some kind
of you know open view for example or
stuff like that i don't know a
kind of experience or not
and so on and so forth but but not to be
precisely defined as you know you have
to have a web server with this form
which you can you know enter
stuff like that because that's silly
and um
apart from that
what else so rappers
uh rules for listings
um
maybe some examples of rap talking
spectral already like party wrap tokens
which are tradable there for example
taking the brox token and
adding that to the exchange as part of
the solution and the india and the rules
and creation of the amms or or whatever
governance tokens for your platform i
think that's it no no more i mean i
i don't know maybe i'm missing something
okay
so generally dao model uh implemented on
the next stage
and everything around user experience
basically and
user experience and talking token owner
experience so things like that okay okay
thank you michael azor please
okay hear me now yep
okay yeah so
i guess for
well more complex mechanics that would
probably include some something like
limit orders and uh
something like
well slippage settings and different
settings to allow for
a different
like market circumstances uh
to you
to to allow
the decks and users uh stay
well um
stay
like
agile uh
regardless of the circumstances on the
market like pairs
so i guess more uh more power to the
users to
to allow them to
uh
to choose different settings and to uh
to perform um
operations with oh with more
different parameters i guess that's
that's more about
what
can be done in this
part of this contest i also wanted to uh
to
make a note of the uh i'm not sure about
the
the prizes for this uh
this stage but i'm pretty sure that uh
well
that the
probably should be increased because of
the of the
well
of the amount of work that it takes to
create
like a solution like this because well
if we just compare to
well the prices for
the complex solution like this to
well to other prices and other sub
governances that
are
oh come on come on come on please stop
it we do not compare prices with other
sub governances
uh i mean
yeah it's just
it just takes uh well a lot of effort
and the
there's uh there's well fluctuations and
price of town and well it takes a lot of
time
come on
this is this is not a full-time job so
uh please stop uh considering contests
like this so actually contests uh are
here to
motivate you create a better product and
not to
serve it you know as a main source of
income
uh actually uh the main uh
main source of income for those who are
developing such solutions and we talked
about this many many times is that you
should operate your solution
and
get
incomes from there so either by selling
your governance tokens or getting some
transaction fees or whatever uh economic
model you you would like to implement in
your solution
but uh
the defies of governance allocate some
budgets to help you build these
solutions not to you know
guarantee the coverage of your of your
costs
this is not not about the contest model
it's all this is not a grant system or
something like this
and uh
speaking about the amount of work uh
so there are some good points uh that
you told and meter told so that need to
be you know some digested and uh
converted into the proposal for the
third stage of the contest maybe it will
be split into two stages if it if there
is a big number of features to be
implemented on the stage for example
they know uh
the next stage is about dao model and
then about the user interfaces user
interaction and so on so on so forth uh
it we
really try to be fair here to when we
are estimating the
cost of the
rewards for for price places but it's
not about you know covering your costs
sorry yes
let me show you some for from my side
yeah but about it uh grants uh uh i i
totally agree grants her that contest
it's about uh
uh subsidized and about involving new
team but
we are here not for contests uh we
i think it's time it's time for business
uh look look to bridge and uh look to
uh ton swap we launched transform
without any contests
and
we created breach and believe me we
spent to breach
much more much more money as before than
we get from tokens
and
and you you can create same story you
can launch down your own tokens uh
uh race round and saturday
yeah so this is uh let's start with the
business let's start with absolutely
totally totally agree like totally agree
okay
thank you and um
small announced from my site in
i think in few weeks uh
two maybe three bit projects uh we'll
we'll go to
to friton
we have tokens we have economy
and
we have we have a lot of liquidity
and uh
and and uh we did it all without
without contest oh of course it's it's
of course it's it's it's it's it's a
company and uh powerful company and uh
we can spend easy money for it uh and uh
developer team
have no
uh with this power but uh but it's about
it's about business uh a lot of a lot of
money from individuals a lot of talking
sales and etc
and let's start doing in photon
yeah and again if if you have some uh
some issues with understanding on how
you can uh benefit from your solutions
and how you can
create a stable uh education flow to to
nourish your business so
there's a lot of people here in this
group who you can consult with and ask
questions so please
don't don't close to yourself we have
very very
small community now so and
it's not no reason to fight with each
other but rather to help each other to
grow
and
only such in such a way we can
make all the free tone become a big big
project and we all will benefit from
this this is exactly how dao
should like absolutely
like originate from like just from
community
yeah definitely definitely okay thank
you guys for for your opinions uh it's
it's not easy to hear something that you
uh i do not agree with but
sometimes it happens so please please
take
it and just move on
uh
okay so that's it for my site uh
no more updates so if you have some
other topics to discuss please raise
your hand
yes i'm sorry
um yeah regarding the the
stage 2 contest i just wanted to thank
all the jurors for their
reviews and their comments
although we didn't really receive any
any questions about the
solution we provided but we were more
than happy to answer any questions if
there's any
like
questions on how to
maybe test or
like details of the implementation so
i guess we'll try to guess
well we'll try to understand which
comments came from from which jurors and
maybe
we'll
provide some
or at least try to
uh to comment on the
uh
something that they provided about the
architecture and stuff like that but
yeah i just wanted to thank everyone for
uh for
details for detailed comments about that
and some valuable feedback
yes
thank you yeah this is by the way uh the
right point so the life doesn't end
after the voting finished
so uh if you have some questions to
development teams so
don't hesitate to go and talk to them
because uh
for developers this is also a really
good motivation to continue the work
when they see the interest from from the
community and they will be more than
happy to answer your questions and help
you
yeah alina please
uh yeah i i only wanted to say that
we we got
the idea of third stage so i think
before the next thursday we'll publish
the draft of the document in there yes
thank you so much
yeah and probably we can tag uh
participants who took part in the second
stage so they can add their views to the
documents so we can discuss it on the
next call yeah yeah please do and and
i'm really grateful to you for taking
the lead on this because
