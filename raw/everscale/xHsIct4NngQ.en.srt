left the defy sub governance so we
 

231
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,870

governance anymore
 

327
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,910
governance anymore
and uh we have deployed a new one uh

328
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
and uh we have deployed a new one uh
 

329
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,269
and uh we have deployed a new one uh
with six

330
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
with six
 

331
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,910
with six

remaining governance members
and uh change the signature scheme to

334
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,000
and uh change the signature scheme to
 

335
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,710
and uh change the signature scheme to
four out of six so just to speed up all

336
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720
four out of six so just to speed up all
 

337
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,990
four out of six so just to speed up all
the payouts to uh

00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
ah so in short the reason is the initial
 

343
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,430
ah so in short the reason is the initial
member list

344
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:11,440

 

345

and maybe of some project three five we

604
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:08,319
and maybe of some project three five we
 

605
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,390
and maybe of some project three five we
will change condition uh we have a lot

606

will change condition uh we have a lot
 

607
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,189
will change condition uh we have a lot
of projects within this negotiation now

608
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:13,199
of projects within this negotiation now
 

609
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,829
of projects within this negotiation now
and we'll watch how it will work

610

there's already a solution like that or
 

1019
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,430
there's already a solution like that or
maybe it's easier to include the open

1020

maybe it's easier to include the open
 

1021
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,350
maybe it's easier to include the open
source uh

1022

what it was meant to be uh is making
 

1165

effective uh use of the
 

1167
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,430
effective uh use of the
of the uh

1168
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,440

in this one we have
 

1213
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,830
in this one we have
hard criteria and soft criteria which

1214
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:35,840
hard criteria and soft criteria which
 

1215
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,230
hard criteria and soft criteria which
could be probably easily translated into

1216
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:38,240
could be probably easily translated into
 

1217
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,269
could be probably easily translated into
it sort of like a standardized system to

1218
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:41,279
it sort of like a standardized system to
 

1219
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,549
it sort of like a standardized system to
to

1220
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:42,559

to
maybe

1224
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:44,960
maybe

objectively
 

1235
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,190
objectively
judge every solution and to have like a

judge every solution and to have like a
 

1237
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,310
judge every solution and to have like a
set of scores that can be then

1238
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:02,320
set of scores that can be then
 

1239
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,909
set of scores that can be then
translated into

1240
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:03,919
translated into
 

1241
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,230
translated into
a single score that we have in the

1242
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:06,240
a single score that we have in the
 

1243
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,389
a single score that we have in the
governance right now so

1244
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:08,399
governance right now so
 

1245
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,470
governance right now so
what do you guys think if

1246
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:10,480
what do you guys think if
 

1247
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,230
what do you guys think if
should should we

1248
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,240
should should we
 

1249
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,669
should should we
think about

1250
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:13,679
think about
 

1251
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,269
think about
um well

1252
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:15,279
um well
 

1253
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,269
um well
maybe standardizing the

1254
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,279
maybe standardizing the
 

1255
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,630
maybe standardizing the
the evaluation process or is it okay as

1256
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:20,640
the evaluation process or is it okay as
 

1257
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,630
the evaluation process or is it okay as
it is right now

1258
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:22,640
it is right now
 

1259
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,549
it is right now
good idea

1260

personal sub subjective points from
jurors

1288
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,320
jurors
 

1289
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,549
jurors

any problems with the
 

1293
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,909
any problems with the
scores we have now but if jurors have

1294
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:05,919
scores we have now but if jurors have
 

1295
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,269
scores we have now but if jurors have
some troubles with the valuation

1296
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:09,279
some troubles with the valuation
 

1297
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,870
some troubles with the valuation
probably yes i don't think it's a

1298
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:10,880
probably yes i don't think it's a
 

1299
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,110
probably yes i don't think it's a
problem for us

1300
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,120
problem for us
 

1301
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,990
problem for us
i

1302
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:14,000
i
 

1303
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,310
i
yeah alexey i think had some more

1304
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,320
yeah alexey i think had some more
 

1305
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:23,350
yeah alexey i think had some more
comments on that

1306
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:23,360

 

1307
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,470

yeah it's a good idea because it's

1308
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:26,480
yeah it's a good idea because it's
 

1309
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,990
yeah it's a good idea because it's
it's one of the

1310
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,000
it's one of the
 

1311
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,110
it's one of the
way to

1312
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,120
way to
 

1313
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,590
way to
make more clear

1314
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:31,600
make more clear
 

1315
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,350
make more clear
assessments of the

1316
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:33,360
assessments of the
 

1317
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,630
assessments of the
different submissions and it will be

1318
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:36,640
different submissions and it will be
 

1319
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,950
different submissions and it will be
it will give a more

1320
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:38,960
it will give a more
 

1321
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,350
it will give a more
like understanding for participants

1322
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,360
like understanding for participants
 

1323
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,430
like understanding for participants
while they get such

1324
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:43,440
while they get such
 

1325
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,269
while they get such
marks and

1326
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:45,279
marks and
 

1327
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,070
marks and
make whole process more clear and

1328
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,080
make whole process more clear and
 

1329
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,430
make whole process more clear and
transparent

1330
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:49,440
transparent
 

1331
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,630
transparent
so i completely support this

1332
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:52,640
so i completely support this
 

1333
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,230
so i completely support this
uh it's

1334
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:54,240
uh it's
 

1335
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,950
uh it's
on one side it's it's a good approach uh

1336
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:56,960
on one side it's it's a good approach uh
 

1337
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,909
on one side it's it's a good approach uh
actually to make kind of uh recommended

1338
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:01,919
actually to make kind of uh recommended
 

1339
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,310
actually to make kind of uh recommended
assessment framework yeah so what what

1340
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,320
assessment framework yeah so what what
 

1341
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,310
assessment framework yeah so what what
jurors should look like which should

1342
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:06,320
jurors should look like which should
 

1343
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,430
jurors should look like which should
look at

1344
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,440
look at
 

1345
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,669
look at
when checking the solution

1346
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:09,679
when checking the solution
 

1347
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,070
when checking the solution
but on the other side uh i don't think

1348
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,080
but on the other side uh i don't think
 

1349
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,590
but on the other side uh i don't think
that including this in the contest

1350
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:13,600
that including this in the contest
 

1351
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,230
that including this in the contest
criteria is is a good idea actually

1352
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,240
criteria is is a good idea actually
 

1353
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,110
criteria is is a good idea actually
because

1354
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,120
because
 

1355
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,470
because
uh

1356
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:18,480
uh
 

1357
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,070
uh
in this way you can you are removing the

1358
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,080
in this way you can you are removing the
 

1359
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,310
in this way you can you are removing the
um

1360
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:24,320
um
 

1361
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,990
um
how to put it

1362
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,000
how to put it
 

1363
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,350
how to put it
the

1364
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:33,360

 

1365
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,310

not subjective uh i mean that

1366
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,320
not subjective uh i mean that
 

1367
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,789
not subjective uh i mean that
some judges uh can use their own

1368
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:38,799
some judges uh can use their own
 

1369
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,509
some judges uh can use their own
criteria system to assess this or that

1370
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:41,519
criteria system to assess this or that
 

1371
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,990
criteria system to assess this or that
work uh and uh

1372
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,000
work uh and uh
 

1373
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,669
work uh and uh
if they can explain uh why they uh

1374
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:47,679
if they can explain uh why they uh
 

1375
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,509
if they can explain uh why they uh
put this mark

1376
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:49,519
put this mark
 

1377
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,990
put this mark
so uh what's the reason to impose uh

1378
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,000
so uh what's the reason to impose uh
 

1379
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,909
so uh what's the reason to impose uh
some some different system to them

1380
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:53,919
some some different system to them
 

1381
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,430
some some different system to them
because uh this was in the very heart of

1382
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:57,440
because uh this was in the very heart of
 

1383
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,350
because uh this was in the very heart of
return actually to to let judges

1384

no no no remember it is just a function

1396
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:16,159
no no no remember it is just a function
 

1397
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,870
no no no remember it is just a function
it's a function when we get the entrance

1398
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:18,880
it's a function when we get the entrance
 

1399
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,990
it's a function when we get the entrance
for a

1400
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,000
for a
 

1401
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,110
for a
contest description and submission and

1402
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,120
contest description and submission and
 

1403
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,350
contest description and submission and
the result of this function is the mark

1404
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:25,360
the result of this function is the mark
 

1405
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,590
the result of this function is the mark
or what you call this exactly and this

1406
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:27,600
or what you call this exactly and this
 

1407
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,190
or what you call this exactly and this
function should be

1408
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,200
function should be
 

1409
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,509
function should be
repeatable and should be

1410
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:31,519
repeatable and should be
 

1411
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,070
repeatable and should be
reproducible so

1412
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,080

judge from their standpoint
 

1447
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,750
judge from their standpoint
so programmers judge from the technical

1448
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:13,760
so programmers judge from the technical
 

1449
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,829
so programmers judge from the technical
standpoint and economists judge from the

1450

standpoint and economists judge from the
 

1451
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,909

alex sorry you can recommend certain
approaches but yeah it's always up to

1460
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,200
approaches but yeah it's always up to
 

1461
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,790
approaches but yeah it's always up to
jurors uh

1462
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:30,800
jurors uh
 

1463
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,750
jurors uh
to decide on the final score so and you

1464
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:33,760
to decide on the final score so and you
 

1465
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,710
to decide on the final score so and you
cannot uh prohibit this or insist uh

1466
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:36,720
cannot uh prohibit this or insist uh
 

1467
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,069
cannot uh prohibit this or insist uh
this is that approach as ultimately uh

1468
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:40,079
this is that approach as ultimately uh
 

1469
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,270
this is that approach as ultimately uh
and truth

1470
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:41,280
and truth
 

1471
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,109
and truth
truth one

1472
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:43,119
truth one
 

1473
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,389
truth one
so uh

1474
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:46,399

 

1475
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,109

otherwise we will get uh

00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,200
contests when they tried to impose such
 

1487
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,270
contests when they tried to impose such
system and in the end it just masked the

is uh
that's why we should have a balanced

1536
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:01,520
that's why we should have a balanced
 

1537
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,750
that's why we should have a balanced
jury actually so we should have some

00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:41,520
rules and indication of how to judge but
 

1753
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,870
rules and indication of how to judge but
we have

1754
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:42,880
we have
 

1755
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,589
we have
very complex uh contests and there are

1756
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:45,599
very complex uh contests and there are
 

1757
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,990
very complex uh contests and there are
many uh hard criterias and soft

1758
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,000
many uh hard criterias and soft
 

1759
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,510
many uh hard criterias and soft
criterias uh inside the contest proposal

1760
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:51,520
criterias uh inside the contest proposal
 

1761
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,710
criterias uh inside the contest proposal
and that criterias are uh

1762
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:54,720
and that criterias are uh
 

1763
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,150
and that criterias are uh
already uh indicators of uh how to

1764
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,160
already uh indicators of uh how to
 

1765
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,230
already uh indicators of uh how to
measure how to judge

1766
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:00,240
measure how to judge
 

1767
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,270
measure how to judge
um not not how but what what to do what

1768
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:03,280
um not not how but what what to do what
 

1769
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,349
um not not how but what what to do what
okay okay there are two different topics

1770
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:05,359
okay okay there are two different topics
 

1771
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,550
okay okay there are two different topics
again uh what to judge right you're

1772
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:08,560
again uh what to judge right you're
 

1773
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,910
again uh what to judge right you're
right but uh every point uh

1774
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:11,920
right but uh every point uh
 

1775
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,349
right but uh every point uh
from the contest proposal uh should

1776
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:15,359
from the contest proposal uh should
 

1777
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,950
from the contest proposal uh should
should be taken into account i think we

1778
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:18,960
should be taken into account i think we
 

1779
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,990
should be taken into account i think we
understand this

1780
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,000

 

1781
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,589

or everybody understands this so

1782
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:25,599
or everybody understands this so
 

1783
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,950
or everybody understands this so
as i

1784
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:26,960
as i
 

1785
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,150
as i
understand the proposed schema is just a

1786
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,160
understand the proposed schema is just a
 

1787
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,750
understand the proposed schema is just a
formalization

1788
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:31,760
formalization
 

1789
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,109
formalization
of

1790
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:33,119
of
 

1791
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,950
of
the scoring not not a measure to

1792
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:36,960
the scoring not not a measure to
 

1793
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,309
the scoring not not a measure to
a point

1794
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:38,319
a point
 

1795
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,470
a point
to judge to

1796
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:40,480
to judge to
 

1797
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,349
to judge to
make his decision somehow it's just a

1798
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:43,359
make his decision somehow it's just a
 

1799
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,990
make his decision somehow it's just a
formalization to make the

1800
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:46,000
formalization to make the
 

1801
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,109
formalization to make the
uh

1802
00:41:47,109 --> 00:41:47,119
uh
 

1803
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,710
uh
judging clearer clear and and the votes

1804
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:50,720
judging clearer clear and and the votes
 

1805
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,430
judging clearer clear and and the votes
will be made more transparent will will

1806
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:53,440
will be made more transparent will will
 

1807
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,109
will be made more transparent will will
be more transparent

1808
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:55,119
be more transparent
 

1809
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,309
be more transparent
it's like

1810
00:41:56,309 --> 00:41:56,319
it's like
 

1811
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,630
it's like
a scoring a card

1812
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:58,640
a scoring a card
 

1813
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,589
a scoring a card
which

1814
00:41:59,589 --> 00:41:59,599
which
 

1815
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,270
which
used in many many places uh

1816
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:03,280
used in many many places uh
 

1817
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,670
used in many many places uh
many many years

1818
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:05,680
many many years
 

1819
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,309
many many years
the issue the issue here is that

1820
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:08,319
the issue the issue here is that
 

1821
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,470
the issue the issue here is that
you uh intentionally frame uh and limit

1822
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:12,480
you uh intentionally frame uh and limit
 

1823
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,990
you uh intentionally frame uh and limit
the extent to which jurors can judge

1824
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:16,000
the extent to which jurors can judge
 

1825
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,829
the extent to which jurors can judge
and areas i know

1826
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:17,839
and areas i know
 

1827
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,990
and areas i know
exactly so so

1828
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:20,000
exactly so so
 

1829
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,390
exactly so so
that's why i'm against this because you

1830
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:22,400
that's why i'm against this because you
 

1831
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,270
that's why i'm against this because you
directly uh indicate that you should

1832
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:25,280
directly uh indicate that you should
 

1833
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,349
directly uh indicate that you should
should have this area this area and this

1834
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:27,359
should have this area this area and this
 

1835
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,430
should have this area this area and this
area and you should put scores like this

1836
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:29,440
area and you should put scores like this
 

1837
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,990
area and you should put scores like this
so uh this

1838
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,000
so uh this
 

1839
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,190
so uh this
just

1840
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:33,200
just
 

1841
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,910
just
seems very good but in fact what it does

1842
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:35,920
seems very good but in fact what it does
 

1843
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,870
seems very good but in fact what it does
it

1844
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:36,880
it
 

1845
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,069
it
restricts

1846
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:38,079
restricts
 

1847
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,829
restricts

00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:44,800
if they for example see that for example
 

1855

in overall this work deserves the first
place but

1891
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,990
i i'm just thinking about uh the
formalization of the criterias written

1892
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,000
formalization of the criterias written
 

1893
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,390
formalization of the criterias written
in the contest proposal but if you think

1894
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:34,400
in the contest proposal but if you think
 

1895
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,750
in the contest proposal but if you think
that uh

1896
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:35,760
that uh
 

1897
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,430
that uh
every judge

1898
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:37,440
every judge
 

1899
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,950
every judge
can

1900
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:38,960
can
 

1901
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,550
can
bring some

1902
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:40,560
bring some
 

1903
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,870
bring some
some his own opinion and that opinion uh

1904
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:44,880
some his own opinion and that opinion uh
 

1905
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,670
some his own opinion and that opinion uh
should have an ability to prevail over

1906
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:47,680
should have an ability to prevail over
 

1907
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,390
should have an ability to prevail over
the technical requirements i understand

1908
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:50,400
the technical requirements i understand
 

1909
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,510
the technical requirements i understand
you but

1910
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:51,520
you but
 

1911
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,950
you but
not exactly they they uh look there are

1912
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:54,960
not exactly they they uh look there are
 

1913
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,589
not exactly they they uh look there are
hard criteria that should be met uh by

1914
00:43:57,589 --> 00:43:57,599
hard criteria that should be met uh by
 

1915
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:58,950
hard criteria that should be met uh by
the contest

1916
00:43:58,950 --> 00:43:58,960
the contest
 

1917
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,910
the contest
but how to interpret the level to which

1918
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:01,920
but how to interpret the level to which
 

1919
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,150
but how to interpret the level to which
this criteria met it should be up to a

1920
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,160
this criteria met it should be up to a
 

1921
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,270
this criteria met it should be up to a
juror

1922
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:05,280
juror
 

1923
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,390
juror
because

1924
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:06,400
because
 

1925
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,790
because
if it's written uh in hot criteria that

1926
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:08,800
if it's written uh in hot criteria that
 

1927
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,630
if it's written uh in hot criteria that
you should put a smiling face on the

1928
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:10,640
you should put a smiling face on the
 

1929
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,589
you should put a smiling face on the
page

1930

page
 

1931
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,150
page
you can just take the first shitty

1932
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:14,160
you can just take the first shitty
 

1933
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,150
you can just take the first shitty
smiley uh from the internet and put it

1934
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:16,160
smiley uh from the internet and put it
 

1935
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,550
smiley uh from the internet and put it
there or draw it by your hand and make

1936
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:18,560
there or draw it by your hand and make
 

1937
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,750
there or draw it by your hand and make
it organically

1938
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:19,760
it organically
 

1939
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,150
it organically
integrated into the page uh

1940
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:22,160
integrated into the page uh
 

1941
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,750
integrated into the page uh
both of them are technically met's

1942
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:23,760
both of them are technically met's
 

1943
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,510
both of them are technically met's
requirements

1944
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:25,520
requirements
 

1945
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,349
requirements
and uh if you directly indicate that uh

1946
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:29,359
and uh if you directly indicate that uh
 

1947
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,190
and uh if you directly indicate that uh
you should indicate

1948
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:31,200
you should indicate
 

1949
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,230
you should indicate
binary uh for example that it's met or

1950
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:34,240
binary uh for example that it's met or
 

1951
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,710
binary uh for example that it's met or
not yeah so it's it's not like not

1952
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:36,720
not yeah so it's it's not like not
 

1953
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,230
not yeah so it's it's not like not
working like this

1954
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:38,240
working like this
 

1955
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,150
working like this
and believe me there are hundreds of

1956
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:40,160
and believe me there are hundreds of
 

1957
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,950
and believe me there are hundreds of
different criteria uh in a juror's mind

1958
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:42,960
different criteria uh in a juror's mind
 

1959
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,710
different criteria uh in a juror's mind
when he's assessing this work he's

1960
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:44,720
when he's assessing this work he's
 

1961
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,829
when he's assessing this work he's
comparing

1962
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:45,839
comparing
 

1963
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,990
comparing
different solutions with each other and

1964
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:48,000
different solutions with each other and
 

1965
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,870
different solutions with each other and
uh

1966
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:48,880
uh
 

1967
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,069
uh
that's why i'm saying it's it's not

1968
00:44:50,069 --> 00:44:50,079
that's why i'm saying it's it's not
 

1969
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,069
that's why i'm saying it's it's not
prohibited to recommend

1970
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:52,079
prohibited to recommend
 

1971
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,030
prohibited to recommend
some approaches and i believe that over

1972
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:55,040
some approaches and i believe that over
 

1973
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,710
some approaches and i believe that over
the time so we will get some kind of uh

1974
00:44:58,710 --> 00:44:58,720
the time so we will get some kind of uh
 

1975
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,550
the time so we will get some kind of uh
good good practice

1976
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:00,560
good good practice
 

1977
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,510
good good practice
yes i think yes i think that we can

1978
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:03,520
yes i think yes i think that we can
 

1979
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,030
yes i think yes i think that we can
somehow join two approaches because

1980
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:07,040
somehow join two approaches because
 

1981
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,069
somehow join two approaches because
um

1982
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:08,079
um
 

1983
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,910
um
the proposed approach

1984
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:09,920
the proposed approach
 

1985
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,109
the proposed approach
makes much more transparency to

1986
00:45:13,109 --> 00:45:13,119
makes much more transparency to
 

1987
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,670
makes much more transparency to
some of them absolutely for the tremor

1988
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:15,680
some of them absolutely for the tremor
 

1989
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,230
some of them absolutely for the tremor
transmissive don't get me wrong okay i'm

1990
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:18,240
transmissive don't get me wrong okay i'm
 

1991
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,870
transmissive don't get me wrong okay i'm
just against the uh tight in the hands

1992
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:20,880
just against the uh tight in the hands
 

1993
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,349
just against the uh tight in the hands
of each uh

1994
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:23,359
of each uh
 

1995

make uh we should
 

2001
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,750
make uh we should
uh leave the ability for for judges to

2002
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:33,760
uh leave the ability for for judges to
 

2003
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,950
uh leave the ability for for judges to
uh make their own decision and

uh if they think for example that

2012
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:44,960
uh if they think for example that
 

2013
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,829
uh if they think for example that
some solution will not work in the real

2014
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:47,839
some solution will not work in the real
 

2015
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,829
some solution will not work in the real
life i understand absolutely

2016
00:45:49,829 --> 00:45:49,839
life i understand absolutely
 

2017
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,790
life i understand absolutely
and we i think that we should postpone

2018
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:52,800
and we i think that we should postpone
 

2019
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,190
and we i think that we should postpone
this very complex question to the next

2020
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:55,200
this very complex question to the next
 

2021
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,550
this very complex question to the next
meeting or so

2022
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:56,560
meeting or so
 

2023
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,109
meeting or so
and uh think about how we can

2024
00:45:59,109 --> 00:45:59,119
and uh think about how we can
 

2025
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,430
and uh think about how we can
really improve and make a step forward

2026
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:01,440
really improve and make a step forward
 

2027
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,030
really improve and make a step forward
in fact

2028
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,040

00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,069
by you guys but yeah i i think that we
can we can easily combine two approaches

2044
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:18,079
can we can easily combine two approaches
 

2045
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,670
can we can easily combine two approaches
to leave

2046
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:19,680
to leave
 

2047
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,790
to leave
um

2048
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:20,800
um
 

2049
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,109
um
some space for interpretation for each

2050
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:23,119
some space for interpretation for each
 

2051
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,670
some space for interpretation for each
other individually and also give them a

2052
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:25,680
other individually and also give them a
 

2053
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,190
other individually and also give them a
framework and

2054
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:27,200
framework and
 

2055
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,750
framework and
also the reason i wanted to to propose

2056
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:29,760
also the reason i wanted to to propose
 

2057
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,950
also the reason i wanted to to propose
this is that i i've seen that it was

2058
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:32,960
this is that i i've seen that it was
 

2059
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,829

really hard for judges because of many
different uh contests that were

different uh contests that were
 

2063
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,069
different uh contests that were
overlapping and they really had very

2064
00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:40,079
overlapping and they really had very
 

2065
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,309
overlapping and they really had very
small amount of time well very little

2066
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:42,319
small amount of time well very little
 

2067
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,349
small amount of time well very little
time to

2068
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:43,359
time to
 

2069
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,069
time to
to

2070
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:44,079
to
 

2071
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,829
to
assess everything and

2072
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:45,839
assess everything and
 

2073
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,390
assess everything and
uh the solutions are really complex so

2074
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:48,400
uh the solutions are really complex so
 

2075
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,630
uh the solutions are really complex so
if they're there's some sort of like a

2076
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:50,640
if they're there's some sort of like a
 

2077
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,630
if they're there's some sort of like a
framework that allows them to

2078
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:52,640
framework that allows them to
 

2079
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,470
framework that allows them to
uh to

2080
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:54,480
uh to
 

2081
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,230
uh to
get basic uh understanding uh of

2082
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:58,240
get basic uh understanding uh of
 

2083
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,190
get basic uh understanding uh of
the heart criteria and of how hard and

2084
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:01,200
the heart criteria and of how hard and
 

2085
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,910
the heart criteria and of how hard and
soft criteria are met and then also add

2086
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:03,920
soft criteria are met and then also add
 

2087
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,950
soft criteria are met and then also add
some

2088
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:04,960
some
 

2089

some
 

2091
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,470
some
subjective opinion from them maybe it

2092
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:08,480
subjective opinion from them maybe it
 

2093
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,710
subjective opinion from them maybe it
will be easier and faster for them and

2094
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:10,720
will be easier and faster for them and
 

2095
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,270
will be easier and faster for them and
uh less complex for them to

2096
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:13,280
uh less complex for them to
 

2097
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,670
uh less complex for them to
and less overwhelming for them to you

how to and where to look let's say

2368
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:17,040
how to and where to look let's say
 

2369
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,710
how to and where to look let's say
because because we know it on the

2370
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:18,720
because because we know it on the
 

2371
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,150
because because we know it on the
application level and we know it's on

2372
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:20,160
application level and we know it's on
 

2373
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,270
application level and we know it's on
the let's say ssi level and the

2374
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:23,280
the let's say ssi level and the
 

2375
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,910
the let's say ssi level and the
but we need to go deeply on the level of

2376
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:25,920
but we need to go deeply on the level of
 

2377
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,829
but we need to go deeply on the level of
the core level of the working with the

activities
 

2753
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,510
activities
with the the standard implementation

2754
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:53,520
with the the standard implementation
 

2755
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,030
with the the standard implementation
with european it should be very

2756
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:55,040
with european it should be very
 

2757
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,670

of the european union and probably we

2760
01:00:00,069 --> 01:00:00,079
of the european union and probably we
 

2761
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,549
of the european union and probably we
can find some use case or prototyping

2762
01:00:02,549 --> 01:00:02,559
can find some use case or prototyping
 

2763
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,349
can find some use case or prototyping
there i just wanted to say that uh this

2764

for sure you should blockchain agnostic

2872
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:09,359
for sure you should blockchain agnostic
 

2873
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,829
for sure you should blockchain agnostic
i mean that that stuff of uh end user

2874
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:11,839
i mean that that stuff of uh end user
 

2875
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:14,309
i mean that that stuff of uh end user
portal and so on but another one good

portal and so on but another one good
 

2877
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:15,829
portal and so on but another one good
use case

2878
01:02:15,829 --> 01:02:15,839
use case
 

2879
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:16,630
use case
so

2880
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:16,640

later in the prototyping in august or

2890
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:29,200
later in the prototyping in august or
 

2891
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,510
later in the prototyping in august or
something and now it's the phase to

2892
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:31,520
something and now it's the phase to
