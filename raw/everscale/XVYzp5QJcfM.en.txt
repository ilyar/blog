in everscale as well as the usual work
chains for data processing there is a
type of chain called a drive chain drive
chains are a type of decentralized
storage device in the everscale network
at its core a drive chain is a work
chain that is optimized so that it can
store large amounts of data
drive chains have special smart
contracts located on them
in order to store a file on a drive
chain you need to deploy a file index
smart contract which is similar to the
index used on unix or linux this file
index contains a certain information
allows you to store and extract files as
well as pay for the storage
so what are the use cases well anyone
can store anything on drive chains an
example of a perfect fit for them is
media storage for nfts
also some of the first consumers of
drive chains will be other work chains
that are archiving old states
so taking a closer look at how drive
chains work everything starts with a
dedicated scalable number of validators
that store the associated data
all the validators are selected using
the delecta smart contract the
validators commit to providing space of
a certain size that meets the system's
requirements on their disks and also
commit to transferring this data within
a certain period of time
validators receive this data as a result
of synchronization if the applicant does
not meet any of these system
requirements they cannot become a
validator
the data is stored in an encrypted
format none of the validators are able
to decrypt the data and read it all
files are stored with multiple copies to
ensure high reliability speed and of
course availability
to make sure that the validators
actually fulfill the stated conditions
the following things take place
random sampling of fragments of stored
files in which small chunks of
information are queried
deterministically
disk occupancy checks by writing quasi
random bits to the disk to fill the
decledge storage space and further
replacing these with client files if
there is a request
and data transfer checks with final
confirmation of receipt from the
customer
if files are unavailable
damaged or are not being transferred
without any notice then the validator
stake is reduced when a certain number
of situations like this occur the
validators who are responsible are
eventually subject to slashing in this
way a transparent and reliable system is
built up where nobody is interested in
not storing not transferring or lying
about the data
