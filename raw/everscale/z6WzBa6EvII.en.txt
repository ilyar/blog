show must go on no matter what god how
many spectators do we have
or maybe like five right now but we'll
probably get with us or without us there
are already a lot of questions mitchell
will have yeah history will record
anything
yeah and then you could share it
so let's start welcome to the identixx
ama just a few months ago in march the
identixx team received a grant from
everscale to create quests for
onboarding new users to web3 projects so
today we're here to catch up with the
team and see what they've been up to
and remember you can always drop a
question anytime in youtube or the
community chat just tag it with uh
identics and we'll find it
so welcome daniel and alex the identics
guys the co-founders uh would you like
to introduce yourselves and tell us what
you've been working on
yeah thanks joe
uh yeah my name is alex uh
i'm a co-founder of identicspace and i'm
responsible for
operations in our projects in our
project and uh we're working closely on
uh as a product owner and working
closely with daniel
on product matters uh
so uh
basically i am like
in web 3 i am since 2016 pretty long
time
uh worked like several projects before
it then
i was a bit unhappy with the crypto
winter that happened in 2019 and decided
to quit but i decided to come back again
in 2020
uh when i uh firstly uh
dive d dug deep uh into the technology
of self-sovereign identity and then
me and uh my partners stephanie was
immediately
joined on the basis of uh working in the
field of self self-sovereign
but after that our product transformed
is in something which is we called
identics
so and i would like to pass the word to
daniel
um what was the question a few words
about myself yes
okay
uh so i'm danielle i'm product manager
of identity space uh i'm working since
the very beginning of this project
we met for the first time with alex in
january 2022
when i was looking for another project
to
work for
before i was
working
as a project
manager at uh
scalpex
crypto futures
exchange and before that uh
alpha bank one of the biggest banks in
russia where i was responsible for
looking
for some
interesting projects
for
bank within crypto and blockchain sphere
so i'm
pretty long
in this space maybe since
2016 or so
and i was uh
one of the
project managers of the waves platforms
so
i was responsible for many things and
was involved in many things from the
beginning of building
wallets exchanges and
gateways and so on so on and here i
found the project of my dream where i
can help people learn things because uh
by my profession i have a diploma of a
teacher
a teacher french and english
so
[Music]
if you need some french
teachers just tell me
maybe i can give you some lessons
for free
and um
well and that's the project identical
space it's a place where people uh
normal people know me uh
simple mortals as we call it them can
learn what web3 encrypt and blockchain
is and we give them simple quests simple
tasks to fulfill and get some small
fraction of
real cryptos to be rewarded
well that's it okay great thank you very
much uh before we dive into the
community questions uh would you like to
give maybe an overview or an update on
identix space or what you guys been
working on
uh
yeah as i said like uh the product like
itself has has been transformed like for
like for the last year uh a couple of
times
uh firstly we started on working on a
south sudan identity system but very
soon we found out that
self-serving identity itself uh is not
necessary unfortunately because people
don't understand like what's uh the
meaning of uh owning their own
credentials and owning the
uh like access to any uh other
informational system and they didn't
people basically do not see a very a
very specific value of uh this
functionality uh therefore we decided uh
to just to develop
this idea
and to grow uh in the creation of
request platform so basically
uh we decided uh that
the best way to learn people how to use
self-certain identity instruments and
self-sovereign identity tools
is to
give them some incentives of using this
tool and we decided that the web3 on
board and quest platform is the best
incentive for them because uh firstly
they create a wallet that's of huge
importance then they make certain
transactions and then they receive
certain achievements in the form of
off-chain verifiable credentials for
on-chain credentials such as nfts and
all this topic uh just emerged like
since may 2022 when retaliating
published his paper on soulbound token
basically uh this concept just it bit a
bit different from our uh like
basic idea that we started with but um
it's like it still supports our basic
principles and uh recently on uh
brochures elysium hackathon uh we
decided to implement all about token uh
but in fact uh this soul bound token
just is a part of uh functionality of
identity space that we are going to
implement in september 2022. so
basically that's our journey from
identity project to a web 3 onboarding
quest platform because we think that uh
learning by doing is the best way for
people to educate them how to use web3
and to give them the opportunity to
uh get some utility value and to enjoy
the using of self-serving identity
instruments
very good great overview um i think we
should just dive into the community
questions now and the first one you've
already kind of touched upon the first
one is why identics what does it mean
this is about the identity you were just
talking about so maybe if you want to
jump into why
well uh
there is no like very like a specific or
very secret story about it we were
thinking of okay we need some kind of
naming uh later we will change it maybe
in one or two months we just need some
something to indeed identify ourselves
to start like texting our partners and
participating in some competitions
especially in their scale ecosystem
uh therefore we decided to call
ourselves uh in the way that will
demonstrate that uh we are focused on
uh the website identity and
decentralized reputation somehow
therefore like we decided to use like
uh
basic uh latin root uh
identity idento uh and like
at this prefix ix
uh so uh basically and we started to
google this name and found out that
there are one or two companies that like
work like since
uh like
early 80s uh but in a bit different
different field and decided to capture
this name as soon as possible
okay it's always interesting to kind of
dive behind what's behind the name and
the brand identity and how teams kind of
come about it
okay so next question is why did you
choose every scale blockchain
yeah uh this is pretty interesting
question because
uh
our team before we started to work on a
product we decided to participate uh in
the first
stage of uh ever scale self-serving
identity framework we uh wrote a
theoretical paper that took uh the first
place and we got like the first award we
wrote a paper on 100 pages with the
theoretical
uh like
background of social identity and with
some practical implementations of it and
what can be done with certain identity
instruments uh in the
ever scale ecosystem and after that we
decided okay if we are really good in
writing papers in every scale maybe
let's do something and another scale and
we decided to make a small team and
this like poor team that joined in
writing uh this paper like was uh
courting for uh the future uh project
identities uh so
therefore like every scale ecosystem was
something that uh united us to work uh
on this project on a permanent basis
because all of us had like other
activities and uh in fact we abandoned
almost all of them and focused on it
therefore like every scale it is
something that was uh with us from the
start
and i i i can say some good words about
like scalability and reliability and etc
that's quite obvious i think because
like uh
like we really believe in something that
this community does here uh especially
in the field of uh
like region because like the protocol
itself is pretty reliable it is cheap it
is fast and uh though this the work that
is done by uh
ecosystem participants in the field of
bridging
is really something promising for us
because we believe that our identifiers
our soul
tokens uh can uh be associated with
nfts across the whole
website ecosystem in other networks
therefore uh every scale is kind of an
enter for us in our infrastructure
is this research document that you made
is this something public or is it um yes
yes yes yes
yes it's a power it was a pub public
competition and as far as remember more
than 15 teams participated in it yeah it
may be found on every scale forum oh
okay yeah
somewhere we should press the link
somewhere
just google just uh
search
uh ssi framework okay and they will get
a response okay great
okay so uh where's your team located
where are you guys
uh we had an international team uh
basically like my
our decency is uh
is from eastern europe mostly uh
but we are located in various countries
most of our team is located in uh
montenegro uh
currently me and daniel we are in
montenegro now
so
and our main office is in montenegro as
well
very cool how many guys are on your team
do you have any uh
stats on growth or
how your team has evolved over time
we have 20
full-time specialists right now uh
from time to time we
just attract some
outsourcing specialists to all stuff
some people like therefore like
this number uh
varies from time to time but basically
there is about like
19 22 uh people who work on our product
on our regular basis
very cool do you have a marketing lead
or anybody on a marketing team or a
marketing roadmap
daniel i'll pass the over to you
that's my question you told me yeah okay
uh yeah we do have uh some marketing
leaders it's me and alex
we are both kind of responsible for
marketing but you know this is the stage
where we still experimenting and uh
trying to get
the right idea in the right place for
the right audience and the this idea of
giving rewards for simple tasks is so
tempting for a lot of people uh that are
not our audience at all uh i mean these
are bounty hunters and not those crypto
newbies that we want to attract so we
have to follow
the trends but at the same time find
some unique niches and unique solutions
to attract the audience the audience we
want
to
teach and to to to inform
so that's why
our marketing team is uh
well
is still forming
uh because we are discerning our
audience and our user profile and trying
to fight with those who are not uh who
are different
or not
our
our target users
uh as for the
next question do we have a marketing
plan
uh we
as as i told already uh we are
experimenting uh and we have uh from
months to month marketing plans and
we're testing some marketing channels as
you know uh web 3 is equals crypto so we
uh
we are like tobacco and alcohol uh
producers we are banned from
usual uh uh advertising channels and uh
uh
usual ways to
give people information so we have to
invent some things or use a native
crypto native ads platform like uh
everybody uses like
like coinzilla like a bit media and some
other cpa networks and of course social
social media and influence
strangely uh we
recently understood that
although we have our end users as
most important users but well they do
not pay us
we are
we're getting paid by the web 3 projects
and by the
so it's it's more a b2b mo b2b business
model so we are developing a marketing
plan
targeted to uh
to marketing teams and founders of web3
projects and crypto and blockchain
projects and this is to be developed and
this is to be researched
as well
and the next question do you have a
roadmap yes we do but it is not public
yet
uh
what is
public is that we are preparing and
developing a big big a very big update
of the whole platform the whole system
because we understood that we made some
some uh
ux mistake uh i i would call it uh
we thought that people like to play
games
and
to play quests
but
we found out that people like to
learn and
to get paid for easy tasks
and
this is game-like experience we
programmed for in the first version
uh prohibited people uh
uh
passengers uh those who pass by to try
because
our product
[Music]
requires many
time and many efforts to be
to be
invest
to go through all the quests
because we prohibit people to for
example to go through the fifth
quest
of everscale uh related farming unless
they go all four quests beforehand
and it doesn't help them to learn
difficult things and it doesn't help us
to unload as many people as we can land
from
advertising channels
so we decided to
we call it unbound quests we will show
every quest and make possible to go
through any quest for any user
without those difficult paths
programmed beforehand where you can
choose your way
now
within a month or so we will
show the upgraded version of identics
quest
which will be more
like
media about
web3 and blockchain and every bit of a
con of content every article will
describe something in a form of guide or
destruction and will and there will be a
special mod modulo block
that
a user can interact with and get
rewarded or get
somehow uh
somehow
uh
rewarded
do you think you guys will be sharing a
project roadmap within a month or so yes
yes we will definitely do that
uh usually they do this to help
investors understand what will be um
what will be developed within a certain
period of time but
we do not have talking yet so we have
only founders to be
responsible to
so
we didn't think that uh roadmap is
something very uh
desired by the by by by all end users
usually they desire get more quests to
to to go through not roadmap
oh it could be really intriguing
treatment though because if you have a
roadmap that you know shows that you
have something
exciting coming up you know they'll be
more inclined to hold tokens and
earn as much as possible
so i think
that's how yeah yeah that's sort of
happening just uh the only thing that we
should understand here is that roadmap
is necessary when you have
a kind of sustainable product when you
understand like okay here is our product
we released it and we are like moving on
the next stage and then on the other
stage etc etc
so uh
when we realized like in may when we
released our like the first version of
our product we understood that
some things uh like in the core nature
of the product where like we're wrong
and we admitted a lot of mistakes and
decided okay like this doesn't work and
this doesn't work let's like fix our
mixtapes and
we totally changed the platform and we
are planning to release it to release it
in august at the beginning of august and
to make it live
and then we will receive like first
feedback from our audience uh and we
will understand how it works
uh
so basically then obviously we will make
very like some kind of a concrete road
map to develop
but we don't do it uh like purposely
because we want to receive a like
primary feedback from
uh our audience and test certain
hypotheses but uh i may promise like
that uh obviously we are going to
implement
uh
the functionality of uh
like
public verifiable credentials and the
keys or
tokens we may call it in different ways
that's something that we are going to do
anyway
and
obviously we will focus on the mobile
version of the platform because
currently it is
on the desktop but we understand that uh
at least half of our potential users uh
try to test our product from the mobile
devices and uh it is not something that
we are ready for now because like for in
in case of mobile ux and moving uh
across various applications it's a bit
more difficult
to create a product uh like webster
mobile product rather than desktop
therefore we decided to make to be
desktop first and then
mobile uh second
makes sense makes sense okay let's move
on to the next question someone wants to
know if you have an audit and if you can
show it
well basically uh
we are not like a
decentralized finance product and we
don't have a great set of smart
contracts to
uh to demonstrate and we don't
we don't even need to demonstrate some
logics because
uh
basically we are the product that
describes other products
in fact uh the only web3 functionality
that we have here is the identity model
and everything that we do in this field
we publish uh we participated in the
next uh competitions on the subservient
identity framework in stages two three
and four and you may find our code
in
this competition materials it's open
source no problem you may use it
um
and like this part is obviously opened
uh we didn't do any audit like uh
by private companies but it is public uh
anyone can come and
give us feedback on the job that we did
and additionally uh it was a condition
of this uh grant that we discussed in
the beginning of this call
we published our functionality which
tracks down web3 transactions
i think we don't hear you alex look
sorry for that
uh yeah
where did you lost me
uh you you just changed to
okay yeah i'm just
i'll tell about the last part yeah uh
because like
one of the condition of the grant that
we discussed at the beginning of the
call is that
we are going to publish uh
the code that tracks down
uh web3 activity of our clients because
our end users in fact because uh we are
not just a media platform that tells
okay go
to metamask download bullet and that's
it
we always want to know whether a person
completed the quest
uh if he goes to flat cube to make a
swap we connect to like flat cube and
track down his wallet and see what's
going on because we want to understand
that something is happening here and uh
we also published our module that uh is
responsible for tracking uh web3
activity on uh the issue where the
person completed some kind of reactivity
but
like whether he committed this to
activity or not
uh this is all that this functionality
is
uh public as well
uh but we didn't do any
uh audit because basically we don't need
it because like most of our
functionality is uh proprietary software
and it's closed therefore there is no
need for it
makes sense okay thank you for sharing
that
so next question who partnered with
identics do you have any partners yet
and do you have plans to explore other
partnerships with
industry leaders
yeah uh
like at the beginning uh our focus uh
was uh on a polygon ecosystem and on the
everscale ecosystem and we partnered
with both of them
and we obviously got some benefits from
the rescue ecosystem as well currently
we are working with some b2b clients uh
in every scale ecosystem and in some
others and
i'm not really sure i didn't sign any
ndas but i'm not really sure whether i
am eligible to disclose this
negotiations but yeah there are some
players from the rescue ecosystem that
we are communicating right now and some
others from other ecosystems obviously
our product will not be focused only on
every scale products but
like every scale products like
they are something that we are very
welcome to partner with because we
already have tracking functionality for
every scale and we are familiar
with how
this blockchain works therefore uh it is
much more suitable for us to create
quests in uh every scale ecosystem that
than in other other blockchains okay
very interesting
there's a good question for you guys
here um do you have a referral system
well uh not now uh at this moment uh
like we don't have a referral system
itself but uh we are working on it and i
think that after the second uh version
of our platform will be published we
will definitely implement it and uh i
was thinking myself about like the form
how this referral system can be done and
i think that there is a very
uh very good and native use case uh in
the field of web three
is to make a doubt
like if you uh want to use uh like a
referral system just make your down
bring your friends and make a doubt and
compete like the the biggest the bigger
dollar you will have like the more
benefits you will get so basically we
want to create some uh web 3 native
incentivization for our users and our
referral his system might be kind of a
quest
for
our end users
if we are talking obviously about b2c
referral system because in terms of b2b
it's uh of course it's a bit different
and we are we are very welcome uh every
any partners who
uh
like are struggling with uh marketing
and all this stuff
we are
very happy to make uh quest uh for you
or your friends or your partners uh
which will explain them how to use your
service
and in fact like uh like the core idea
of our product uh
it is something that was not mentioned
at the beginning of our session uh for
now is that
uh our main goal in future is to create
a profile for decentralized reputation
for end user
what it means for businesses it means
that uh let's imagine that uh you are
struggling with marketing you are
spending lots of money in google ads or
spending a lot of money on airdrops and
only
like
airdrop hunters are coming and getting
your money and you don't get a proper
uh effect that you expected
in fact our users after they passed like
10 20 30 40 quests
they we we call them power users that's
the users that
who are experienced who at least know
how to use certain web 3 services and
they're interested in various services
and it is uh provable that they have uh
wallets at least in like two three four
five uh blockchain ecosystems that means
that for example you may create like
uh quests for your bridge or for swap or
for something more complicated so these
users is not just something that you may
get from
google ads they have
their own decentralized reputation that
may be proven by demonstrating their
soul bound tokens that is of huge
importance so basically we create a
system of
uh we call it inverting marketing
where
uh if you want to get these users to
come to them basically you come to
identics
and make a quest
and that's how you get the attention of
these users and that's how you may give
them some discounts bonuses or access to
some uh other benefits and that's how
you may like attract their attention so
basically uh
we obviously we have educational
platform for our end users
uh but for our clients for businesses
uh we are like
like the source of very good power users
and very good leads
that's our passion in the market
very interesting these users can be
excellent ambassadors as well
sure
businesses
yes
cool
last question guys if i want to suggest
an idea for your service who should i
contact
well uh i'm always guys are here
yes yeah uh daniel and me uh
the people who are available 24 7
especially me uh my calendar is
unlimited for any time zone the name day
of the week therefore i will be happy to
contact to anybody who is
end user to receive a feedback or
potential partner or
infrastructure partner
very welcome
does uh identics have a community chat
like a telegram group or anything people
might want to join
yes we do we have telegram chat and we
have discord server
uh where we have kind of activity there
okay let's share those links
okay guys i don't have any more
questions that's it so identicspace
thank you very much alex thank you very
much daniel for your time and
information
i'm sure community appreciates all this
information
thanks from their questions
