uh
said that uh at a current condition with

said that uh at a current condition with
 

407
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,550
said that uh at a current condition with
a low load from on the network it is

408
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
a low load from on the network it is
 

409
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,990
a low load from on the network it is
important that

410
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
important that
 

411
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,790
important that
uh

412
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
uh
 

413
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,350
uh
smart contract change when we have like

414
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
smart contract change when we have like
 

415
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,870
smart contract change when we have like
chain of uh executions they uh if they

416
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
chain of uh executions they uh if they
 

417
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,829
chain of uh executions they uh if they
pack in one block in one sharp then uh

418
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
pack in one block in one sharp then uh
 

419
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,070
pack in one block in one sharp then uh
it moves much faster than

420
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
it moves much faster than
 

421
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,910
it moves much faster than
when when uh those uh that chain of four

422
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
when when uh those uh that chain of four
 

423
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,389
when when uh those uh that chain of four
contact executions is spread between

424
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
contact executions is spread between
 

425
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,910
contact executions is spread between
different charts

426
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:09,920
different charts
 

427
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,630
different charts
so they asked to do it because

428
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
so they asked to do it because
 

429
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,870
so they asked to do it because
it will show

430
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
it will show
 

431
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,150
it will show
much

432
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
much
 

433
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,350
much
better

434
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
better
 

435
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,150
better
latency for users and this will help to

436
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
latency for users and this will help to
 

437
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,670
latency for users and this will help to
promote every scale

438
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
promote every scale
 

439
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,430
promote every scale
so there were some

440
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
so there were some
 

441
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,750
so there were some
discussions technical concerns about it

review
so each

656
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
so each
 

657
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,509
so each
we have

658
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:01,519
we have
 

659
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,030
we have
four teams inside the favorites

660
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,040
four teams inside the favorites
 

661
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,269
four teams inside the favorites
and actually

662
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:07,279
and actually
 

663
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,829
and actually
i think at some point they

664

i think at some point they
 

665
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,790
i think at some point they
should come on

666
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:12,800

 

667
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,030

creation is very easy too
i will

1258
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,360
i will
 

1259
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,470
i will
choose one of the images

1260
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:10,480
choose one of the images
 

1261
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,430
choose one of the images
we have wonderful cropper

1262
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:13,440
we have wonderful cropper
 

1263
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,789
we have wonderful cropper
why it's wonderful because

1264
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:16,799
why it's wonderful because
 

1265
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,390
why it's wonderful because
you can see it's a square

1266
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:20,400

 

1267
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,110

that means that all the images on the

1268
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,120
that means that all the images on the
 

1269
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,669
that means that all the images on the
marketplace will be the equal size and

1270
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:25,679
marketplace will be the equal size and
 

1271
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,430
marketplace will be the equal size and
it will

1272
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:27,440
it will
 

1273
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,750
it will
it looks great

1274
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:29,760
it looks great
 

1275
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,549
it looks great
so

1276
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:30,559
so
 

1277
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,909
so
let's

1278
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:33,919

 

1279
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,230

something like this

1280
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:36,240
something like this
 

1281
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,430
something like this
we can choose the category let it be

1282
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:39,440
we can choose the category let it be
 

1283
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,190
we can choose the category let it be
masks

1284
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,200
masks
 

1285
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,549
masks
something like this

1286
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:42,559
something like this
 

1287
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,029
something like this
we can create collection i have created

1288
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:45,039
we can create collection i have created
 

1289
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,990
we can create collection i have created
some of them and then we press just

1290
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,000
some of them and then we press just
 

1291
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,070
some of them and then we press just
click it

1292
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,080
click it
 

1293
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,350
click it
it will

1294
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:51,360
it will
 

1295
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,510
it will
ask to

1296
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:53,520
ask to
 

1297
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,789
ask to
send some funds for meeting

1298
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:56,799
send some funds for meeting
 

1299
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:05,350
send some funds for meeting
let's do it

1300
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:05,360

 

1301
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,510

and the process of meeting of meeting is

1302
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:09,520
and the process of meeting of meeting is
 

1303
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:16,630
and the process of meeting of meeting is
start

1304
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:16,640

 

1305
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:24,630

we need to wait as always for some times

1306
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:24,640

 

1307
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:31,430

to meet energy

1308
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:31,440

 

1309
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,430

while we are waiting

1310
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:33,440
while we are waiting
 

1311
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,549
while we are waiting
next i will show you that we also have

1312
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:36,559
next i will show you that we also have
 

1313
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,630
next i will show you that we also have
auction logic on our marketplace and

1314
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:40,640
auction logic on our marketplace and
 

1315
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,710
auction logic on our marketplace and
buying logic 2. i will show it later

1316
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:44,720
buying logic 2. i will show it later
 

1317
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,350
buying logic 2. i will show it later
let's give us some time to meet

1318
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,360
let's give us some time to meet
 

1319
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,190
let's give us some time to meet
after meeting it will be automated

1320
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,200
after meeting it will be automated
 

1321
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,750
after meeting it will be automated
automatically to automatically reload

1322
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:51,760
automatically to automatically reload
 

1323
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,389
automatically to automatically reload
the page

1324
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:54,399

 

1325
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,070

so let's wait

1326
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,080
so let's wait
 

1327
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,909
so let's wait
um

1328
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:57,919
um
 

1329
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,350
um
so we start some of the data we store in

1330
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:01,360
so we start some of the data we store in
 

1331
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,710
so we start some of the data we store in
ipfs uh we choose uh

1332
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:04,720
ipfs uh we choose uh
 

1333
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,590
ipfs uh we choose uh
by the way i like the idea to store

1334
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:07,600
by the way i like the idea to store
 

1335
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,430
by the way i like the idea to store
everything in chunks

1336
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:09,440
everything in chunks
 

1337
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,710
everything in chunks
but in economically it's not very easy

1338
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:12,720
but in economically it's not very easy
 

1339
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,110
but in economically it's not very easy
to calculate because images are

1340
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,120
to calculate because images are
 

1341
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,549
to calculate because images are
different and so on that's why uh

1342
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:18,559
different and so on that's why uh
 

1343
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,350
different and so on that's why uh
somehow it's not very easy to calculate

1344
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360
somehow it's not very easy to calculate
 

1345
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,389
somehow it's not very easy to calculate
the final uh inverse which we will need

1346
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:24,399
the final uh inverse which we will need
 

1347
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,870
the final uh inverse which we will need
to store the image forever that's why

1348
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:26,880
to store the image forever that's why
 

1349
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,269
to store the image forever that's why
ipfs is much

1350
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:29,279
ipfs is much
 

1351
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,430
ipfs is much
better very end

1352
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:31,440
better very end
 

1353
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,789
better very end
so let's wait

1354
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:32,799
so let's wait
 

1355
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:33,750
so let's wait
for

1356
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:33,760
for
 

1357
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:46,630
for
meeting

1358
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:46,640

 

1359
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,230

just

1360
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:48,240
just
 

1361
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,350
just
uh

1362
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:49,360
uh
 

1363
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,430
uh
it's pretty fast i mean

1364
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:51,440
it's pretty fast i mean
 

1365
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,750
it's pretty fast i mean
we just need to wait for

1366
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:53,760
we just need to wait for
 

1367
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,990
we just need to wait for
transaction in every scale

1368
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,000
transaction in every scale
 

1369
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,750
transaction in every scale
and for the

1370
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:57,760
and for the
 

1371
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,830
and for the
loading all our data on ipfs

1372
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:01,840
loading all our data on ipfs
 

1373
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,909
loading all our data on ipfs
so

1374
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:03,919
so

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,389
so
i can see that we successfully

pretty search system where we can for
example

1538
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:47,760
