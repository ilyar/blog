system they can join testing and they

94
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
system they can join testing and they
 

95
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,750

99
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,390

see how it works

100
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
see how it works
 

101
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,710
see how it works
uh this is the first

102
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
uh this is the first
 

103
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,470
uh this is the first
actually this is the first phase of uh

104
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
actually this is the first phase of uh
 

105
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,309
actually this is the first phase of uh
releasing of smft

106
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319

109
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,550
consensus
so there will be more updates but i

110
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
so there will be more updates but i
 

111
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,070
so there will be more updates but i
think this is

112
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,080
think this is
 

113
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,910
think this is
probably most important at the moment

114
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
probably most important at the moment
 

115
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,030
probably most important at the moment
because

116
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
because
 

117
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,990
because
uh

it is a big
 

125
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,190
it is a big
chunk of code to be honest

126
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
chunk of code to be honest
 

127
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,550
chunk of code to be honest
so the same story happened with ramp

128
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
so the same story happened with ramp
 

129
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,270

also was
 

133
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,430
also was
released in public so ramp

134
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
released in public so ramp
 

135
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,949

137
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,670

ram software is

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
ram software is
 

139
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,949
ram software is
almost

140
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
almost
 

141
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,509
almost
uh ready for production i hope so

142
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
uh ready for production i hope so
 

143
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,430
uh ready for production i hope so
because it was interest for quite a

144
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,440
because it was interest for quite a
 

145
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,190
because it was interest for quite a
number of months

146
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
number of months
 

147
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,789
number of months
uh coming to network called rfld

148
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
uh coming to network called rfld
 

149
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:31,509
uh coming to network called rfld
uh

150
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
uh
 

151
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,229
uh
now validators they have plans to

152
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
now validators they have plans to
 

153
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,430
now validators they have plans to
launch

154
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440
launch
 

155
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,789
launch
the

156
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,799
the
 

157
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,390
the
rfld network

158
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
rfld network
 

159
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,550
rfld network
with ram and do

160
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
with ram and do
 

161
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,789
with ram and do
community testing

162
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
community testing
 

163
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,110
community testing
so will be interesting to see how to

164
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
so will be interesting to see how to
 

165
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,589
so will be interesting to see how to
work because before that one leverage

166
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
work because before that one leverage
 

167
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,630
work because before that one leverage
made uh test for ramp

168
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
made uh test for ramp
 

169
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,229
made uh test for ramp
uh protocol

170
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
uh protocol
 

171
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,070
uh protocol
so those are two major

172
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
so those are two major
 

173
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,949
so those are two major
advances in in development and now they

174
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
advances in in development and now they
 

175
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,309
advances in in development and now they
are open for everyone

176
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,319
are open for everyone
 

177
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,789
are open for everyone
so now you see that everex

178
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
so now you see that everex
 

179
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,949
so now you see that everex
who was doing

180
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
who was doing
 

181
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,789
who was doing
stuff during that

182
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
stuff during that
 

183
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,869
stuff during that
year

184
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
year
 

185

you probably don't know
multi-signature contract was written

220
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280
multi-signature contract was written
 

221
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,950
multi-signature contract was written
before even the launch of network

222
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
before even the launch of network
 

223
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,830
before even the launch of network
and this is a great contract i think

224
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840
and this is a great contract i think
 

225
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,990
and this is a great contract i think
because as far as as now due to phone

226
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
because as far as as now due to phone
 

227
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,710
because as far as as now due to phone
modification there were no any problems

now
 

235
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,629
now
since compiler

236
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
since compiler
 

237
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,070

since that time
 

245
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,350
since that time
uh the code was which was written more

246
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
uh the code was which was written more
 

247
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,510
uh the code was which was written more
than two years

248
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
than two years
 

249
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,070
than two years
i don't know two and a half years ago it

250

uh just
 

259
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,230
uh just
in the input update there are some

260
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
in the input update there are some
 

261
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,029
in the input update there are some
additional

262
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039

 

263
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,590

features will be added to

264
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
features will be added to
 

265
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,749
features will be added to
multi-signature contract

266
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759

 

267
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,350

for example they will be protection from

268
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
for example they will be protection from
 

269
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,950
for example they will be protection from

270
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
replay
 

271
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,990
replay
uh

272
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
uh
 

273
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,550
uh
we which means the message to much

274
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
we which means the message to much
 

275
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,430
we which means the message to much
signature

276
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440

 

277
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,270

should include signature of the

278
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
should include signature of the

281
00:05:59,039 --> 00:05:59,909
addressee
so

282
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
so
 

283
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,150
so
they will not be possible to replay the

284
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
they will not be possible to replay the
 

285
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,710
they will not be possible to replay the
message for one contract

286
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:04,720
message for one contract
 

287
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,469
message for one contract
for another contact with exactly the

288
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
for another contact with exactly the
 

289
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,870
for another contact with exactly the
same custodians

290
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
same custodians
 

291
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,150
same custodians
which is again not the back of the

292
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
which is again not the back of the
 

293
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,230
which is again not the back of the
contract it's a logical uh

294
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240

 

295
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,590

uh

296
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
uh
 

297
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,390
uh
logical issue which was not envisaged uh

298
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
logical issue which was not envisaged uh
 

299
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,670
logical issue which was not envisaged uh
when it was designed in first place

300
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
when it was designed in first place
 

301
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,550
when it was designed in first place
uh

302
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
uh
 

303
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,150
uh
yeah so that got it for the test

304
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
yeah so that got it for the test
 

305
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,230
yeah so that got it for the test
and hopefully
