so i would like to tell you a bit about
our project if somebody doesn't know it
just join us or watching us on youtube
and then i will tell you about our
talking sale a bit and then we are open
for your questions
uh so if i can share my screen that
would be amazing
yeah for sure you can
share
yeah
uh
so
uh i'm very happy to tell you if you
don't know yet that we launched our
project last week on friday 18th of
march
and our project name is everland.app
we had a different name a day ago but we
faced a problem that it's
quite hard to pronounce for some time
and for somebody so we decided to
rebrand it
and
now we are everland.app
and on the screen you can see our
website and we were working on the
project for
around six months and we are very proud
of this project and we made it for ever
scale community
and uh our project is uh the fight
platform uh it's a landing protocol i
will make a very short presentation on
what you can do here
uh you go to our website and here you
first you what you have to do is connect
your wallet now two
wallets are available it's ever wallet
and our own everscale wallet so i would
like to use this one
uh so uh you connect your wallet and
after that the system offer you offers
you to create account
we need a bit more time to do that
sorry for delay
okay now i can uh i connected my wallet
and i can create an account
you have to have 10 errors on your
account but most of them comes back
to your
created account
yeah uh here on the main screen you can
see
uh total values which we now have total
supply and total borrowed for now it's 5
000 at a usd team and uh here you can
see a main tablet with the
main info uh usdt and weber now we
support two currencies cryptocurrencies
and here you can see percentage
here
yep
account is creating
how do you like our loader we love it so
much
yeah here you can see the main tablet
with the main info which share relevant
for now
uh
supply ap bureau
supply balance available uh balance and
debt
uh these numbers they're changeable and
they depend on total values and market
uh situation
so uh here you can see if you put uh if
you supply usd uh you will earn a
3.05 percent and if you borrow usdt you
have to pay a 9.92 percentage uh so here
we have our account uh here we have all
the info about the account and let's
supply some webers
i hear uh here on my wallet i already
have some
uh but if you don't have a weaver
whether you can
wrap our ever
currency
on the special website we will
definitely add the
bottom which can lead here
uh but for now i have whatever here and
i can supply like 40
so uh this is how you get uh collateral
for
future borrowings
and here we have transaction accept
and it's loading
still waiting
probably we should add some music for a
while
okay
uh yeah and by the way what is important
to notice for now uh
before i forgot uh that here on the
website for now the rapper
website for now you can connect every
wallet
according to this button but uh we made
a really great update for our wallet
uh thanks to which you can use our
wallet here for that you have to go to
extensions and
turn off ever wallet for a while not
deleting it but turn it off
and since that moment as you can see in
the
settings
you can
enable ever wallet emulation
so here when you press connect every
wallet
you will get our ever skill wallet in
case if you don't want to switch
and to transfer
average between two accounts
just quite usable info
so here we have uh now we have
[Music]
now we have to see
our supply
okay while loading i will start telling
you our main input that at the same time
when we started and launched our product
our project on this friday we also
launched talking sale of our project uh
this uh we're really happy to do this at
the same time because
we offering tokens not from project will
which will be created but already ready
to use project which is already working
and
uh
like we
we will be very grateful for support and
i will show you more about our talking
sale
in a while
and for now as you can see uh supplied
balance is shown and available balance
issue and you can withdraw it or i can
borrow
some usdt as you can hear let's see from
here the tablet is also
renewed
waiting waiting
just a bit more time
well here you can see your borrow limits
and i will do
borrow one usd team for now
if
while we're waiting i really hope you
already joined
our telegram channel and medium and
twitter we post very relevant info there
uh per request sent okay
yeah we can for now
check out our website
and here in the end you can see all the
needed links
okay okay let's see
okay let's do this again
yeah uh some troubles may appear like
problems with your network or anything
else uh feel free to
text into our telegram channel uh we are
there like all the time and we respond
as soon as possible
[Music]
here let's try again
oh no it's just loading
okay
uh when it will be loaded you will see
uh updated uh account status and you
will see updated info about markets
uh
that's pretty easy about our
platform and very important thing what
what happens after that uh
the
time uh to which you borrow uh currency
uh it's not limited so you can
give it back as soon as you want
and uh you shouldn't forget that you
have to pay for a
percent for using a currency
and it is also very important that you
will see your risk rate here when you
borrow
currencies
because
we have this thing as health of the user
and
if the house oh great now we can see
this uh the data uploaded great
uh
as you can see from
sorry i just wanted to all tablets to be
uploaded
uh
yeah so when if a user pays that and
pays percentage everything is great he
just takes his collateral and use it as
as he wishes
but
if
the user doesn't pay debt and his risk
uh gets up to 100 percentage than
liquidators
other users
uh if they see that they can liquidate
his um
debt they have to pay his debt back and
they get
[Music]
debt
according to
for example if users uh has a debt an
amount 50 usdt
uh then
a liquidator has to pay this 50 usd back
and you will get
plus eight percent for doing that
so that's pretty it i guess about the
platform for now um
we just started and what we have for now
um as i said feel free to ask any
questions uh
and now i'd like to tell you a bit more
about our token
uh here you can find on our website you
can find um
token information
uh
our total token supply will be 10
million land uh the land is the name of
very token
and here is you can see in for about
what is ever i'm sorry i wouldn't um
change the name here yet but we'll do
this definitely today everland to
pronounce it easier uh here's the scheme
how how everland works and here you can
see
distribution of land tokens which will
be
done so now we have third sale it's 5.5
percentage from the whole total token
supply
and
we have and
it's
550 000 land tokens uh you can see on
the main page button by talking violin
tokens
and you will be redirected to our
ever scale
launchpad platform
and we are very happy to be very first
project on this platform we even project
zero
and here you can see all the relevant
info
uh total sales for now and participants
and we were so happy today to share that
we already
uh
went through the point of the middle of
soft cup here you can see all the info
you need
soft cup hard cup now when you deposit
uh adverse uh you don't get particular
amount of tokens uh but the tokens will
be distributed after
the talking land at the token sale is
over
uh our soft cup is 1.5 million average
and hardcup is
2.75 millions everest i here you can see
info about testing when it will be paid
to you your tokens back and also some
info about the project and again
all the needed links
so
uh
what's the point about the talking
we like our project to be
pure as down
so the community can decide its future
and can decide its current um
uh
[Music]
how to say the word i mean
in english
decide mechanics and decide on various
[Music]
various ways how it will be developed
so
um here you can again find all the info
i'm sorry uh i also would like to say
that now we go through a verification
process held by every scale community
it's very long process to be honest and
we launched before it's actually ended
uh we're on in contact with the guys who
do who do this and uh
this is why we now have limits for
different operations and so it will be
safe for the platform and for the users
when um
formal verification will be over
uh we
maybe will have to change something a
bit or
we hope that not so uh
guys from formula formal verificators
they ask us who decide on maine
[Music]
excuse me
who decided main indicators of course
and we said that this is why we do our
talking land because the community will
be
uh the one who decides uh the
level of different indicators for the
project for the platform so the token
holders who will be the most interested
in the success of the platform
will decide like its fate
so
we will be very grateful for your
questions we will be grateful for your
support everything pretty
easy for now and as i said twice already
feel free to ask any questions you have
and
yeah that's pretty easy for presentation
sorry for
maybe a long time it took a bit longer
than we planned
you can watch it on 2.6
uh thank you alina for your presentation
uh there was uh
two or maybe
three questions that i've seen in the
chats that the first question was uh
what the maximum time a user can
land the tokens yeah yeah as i said the
time is not limited
but you have to take into account that
uh
that the market's situation can be
changed so the
uh percentage you have to pay
can be changed and if you don't support
your collateral at some point you can be
your alone can be
too risky to stay on the platform so it
can be liquidated so you'd rather
have a big collateral and don't go with
your risk level too far away or
you can land it for as long as you want
and for as long as you pay percentage
thank you thank you
um so there's was uh
more question
uh regarding the dow talking that uh is
it
will be uh
available uh in the farming
or where we can see because a few
community members support uh in the chat
that they've seen on the flat cube uh
the farming pair
uh that they can farm uh can you tell
more about it
uh yes as i said we have a talking
page which you can see on the main page
you can go here and from here you can
see how the funds will be used that our
star sale is just 5.5 percentage and
yeah we have a huge percentage for
farming and other reserve fund and
community sale so yeah we
really do plan to farming and to be
honest flat cube
is
meant to be the first platform we plan
to list on
i can't tell you more about farming for
now because we have to wait before uh
token sale and and
then it will be decided but yeah we do
really plan to do farming
thank you thank you
uh and maybe can you
disclose more about the future plans
that you are going
to do after
after successful uh
soft hard cap
uh yes sure about the tokens um
people have to be aware that it will be
lockup period and it will be investing
after that so you don't get your tokens
right after sale will be ended
uh please
please be aware be aware of that so we
don't create any conflicts here please
check all the information and ask all
the questions you
um
you have
uh before going into the project and of
course we plan to do more currencies to
support to prevent more users to the
platform because uh the main uh reason
is we do really believe that this
project is amazing for every scale uh
ecosystem and uh
we know that we did it uh on our own
without any grants or any
uh
other ways uh like it was done before
and we do really believe in this project
and we won't eat
the total supply go nuts total borrowed
go nuts and all still be very safe and
all the users get
a lot of uh you know gain from it
they
can use their
[Music]
resources
as they want uh with the
biggest value for them
uh just the questions that i've got uh
in the personal messages
uh
if there are some uh mem uh tokens
who are who wants to be listed on the
everland app what they should do
to list the next token which will be
listed on our
platform yeah
how how to list
your own token on your platform
uh for now uh we
support only these two tokens as i said
before uh verification will be
ended before more users come to the
platform so we can be sure that
it's safe
and
[Music]
that it's safe for users
and after that
as i said
uh dao
decide the way how tokens will be landed
to the platform
[Music]
thank you uh so there's no more question
from uh
prepared for a question and the
community questions that they've got
now so let's check uh now on youtube uh
maybe someone from zoom want to ask the
question
i see here yeah yeah maybe you have a
question
no worries we understand that we wrapped
into the community with our huge news
and huge project and we
uh
let everybody know as as much as we can
about it so we're pretty okay with
little amount of questions probably we
push through this week more and
everybody see this video on youtube and
if needed we're ready to held any other
armor or on our own platform uh we get
together our own community on telegram
and we
will be happy if it's needed to to have
another almond
so if there is no questions
for sure
yeah for sure i
we can invite you and your team uh to
our uh
i can say weekend uh voice chats
uh here you can answer the community
questions and they will probably ask you
more questions after this aiming yeah
yeah great sure and we plan to
uh
to help this to hold the speech on the
next tuesday weekly
every scale uh call and maybe if you see
this presentation it will not be needed
uh to be on the next one but still can
be very interesting questions and we
will be happy to tell you more
we were so
busy with creating the project so we
forgot a bit to promote ourselves long
ago
yeah so uh that's okay thank you very
much
yeah great great
so on this note i
want to wish uh everyone uh good luck
and uh thank you alina and uh sweet team
that you guys presented such wonderful
products in uh everscale ecosystem thank
