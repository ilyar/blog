okay
so
hi eugene
i'm sure meech is coming
so wait for a few more people
sam
hello hello
god
look like i've just got back from the
gym sorry guys
oh wait has everyone else struggled with
those zoom updates just is that why
we're a couple of minutes late
i haven't had an issue yet
i don't know okay as soon as i connected
it started trying to do all these wacky
updates oh that's so annoying maybe it's
just me again not knowing how to use my
mac yeah but i'm getting better guys so
just just in case anyone wanted an
update
that might be as soon as you get a new
computer it's just like all full-on
updates here and there
exactly yeah throw it away like forget
this
consider swapping hair like half of your
hair goes to you i think that would be
make both of us look a little bit nicer
i'm sure we can uh get a zoom filter
made up
you both look great
suits your personalities
so
i'll thank you
i still need to get me in uh updated mug
i'm still drinking out of the old brand
oh just realized
you got the friton mug right yeah it's
it is a funky design
i've got i've got hats t-shirts and
things and
i'm like god damn
i need to update that's why i see
when there was the ever point conference
i was like yes swag save something for
me give it to me
we'll see if you get it
don't know if you guys have like uh the
equivalent of car boot sales over where
you are but uh i think i'm going to have
to uh do one soon
like selling out of the trunk of your
car
yeah it's quite a big british
institution almost um sunday mornings
british people all across the land come
rain or shine will get up very very
early and they'll drive their cars to
patches of like little grass in a field
somewhere on mass
and that their boots will just be full
of stuff that really really needs to go
in the bin it's of no use but then
everyone else who's there selling will
eventually walk around and buy everyone
else's stuff i bet there are some
treasures to be found by the way alex
alex show us that shirt i've never seen
it before
looks good
that's one of the new designs of their
skill t-shirt i think there are a couple
of teams who did some merch for every
point
but this is part of it can you only get
it if you attended the event or is it
for sale because i think they'll be
trying to make it big so um yeah they'll
probably restore the
form of free free time shop glory
cool every skill looks like we have some
critical mask here
yep okay
well good day everybody and welcome to
weekly meet number 103 hooray
may has been a really crazy month so far
in a good way so we have a really great
agenda with some presentations from the
community and also a couple of recaps
from the parties the everscale two-year
parties that we had
anniversaries very cool
so the call might be a bit short which
is fine because of you know the recent
well-deserved partying around the world
so let's get to it
and we have richa who has joined us with
some
tech updates
i think there's something interesting to
be heard
yeah well not so much because actually
like as you know
it's not it's too early yeah
yeah because
like the announcement will be around
what nine o'clock
it's pacific time so about two more
hours
oh yeah first oh okay so first
announcements about yes about two hours
from now and the dockercon presentation
i think will be available in
three hours afterwards right
yes
so yeah so you all are welcome to kind
of go and
join and
download this presentation watch it on
demand
from dockercon materials
it's uh
like it's been completely crazy
uh
like we did this product that we're
going to announce
um
well you know it's gosh obviously
but i don't think you know anything else
um right so um
so yeah please
join we
made a very cool
presentation for docker fun it's about
12 minutes long with some
live technical demo there and
also
like about session we also invited some
some first users to
you know
talk about their experience so please
you know go go look at that and
well we will talk after that i'm sure
um i also i think we are going to
schedule some
ama session about that later on i'm sure
you will have tons of questions i mean
tons of questions
it's uh yeah it's very interesting both
the product and the
and the launch itself um
so
yeah so like
well welcome and enjoy cannot tell more
really i'm under embargo
for for now
so we'll switch to technical dates
the network now
um
well
obviously like we were consumed with
this with this launch
and um
you cannot do
you know so many things at once but
nevertheless there is a 24
version 24 upgrade of the network which
we are still waiting for majority of uh
validators to switch on didn't happen
yet
i'm calling everyone to please
you know do that uh and in order to do
that it's not a public release in a way
because i already explained why
um
well i can't repeat
because it's a security
threat that the network the
the node
uh stops for about
40 to one hour sometimes to fix the
um
the cells uh corrupted cells that's what
this update is partly doing
apart from all other things and
in order not to stall the network we
need this upgrade to
be really like gradual but not that
great
you know so like there is no there is no
good i don't know violence i think
but anyway there is a sergey turin
who has done
immense work on scripts
which are doing that automatically for
you if you use his scripts if you are
not please nevertheless just uh ask him
and he will give you all the changelog
information about the subreddit and will
give you the instructions on how to
upgrade the note
he he's coordinating this effort
uh you know and he's part of the
communities you know not uh representing
any team
so
you know please
do that there's still just 25 of the
notes upgraded up until now it's merely
not enough it's
it's um we need like
uh more than 80 percent
um so we're still waiting for this
upgrade to move further further with the
other upgrades that we need to do and
switch some capabilities on and stuff
like that
um
the sdk has released
a version of the sdk when the last
version of the sdk supports
ramp i mean maybe you saw that
in their change log
so um
the sdk
now is fully prepared
for the introduction of ram to the
network but of course we cannot
introduce ramp to the network before we
all move to the version 24
and beyond
so it's every step at the time
but we need your support on that we
cannot introduce anything new
right now we need to
move doesn't you know
please do
that's it i think from me thank you
okay thank you michael uh circling back
to dockercon 2022 just for a second in
case anybody didn't know about it it's a
free event completely free you just have
to register with an email address
it's focused on bringing the entire
community of docker developers
contributors and partners
all over the world together and it shows
them some new things that are happening
in the ecosystem
how to take advantage of innovations
and some special announcements hint
something that
everybody should not miss because this
is going to be
something really awesome um
and huge for everscale and everybody so
click the links go through watch it
support and
when the news hits we'll be sharing it
around so
stay tuned keep your eyes peeled
and so
uh on to presentations we have the
everpoint conference highlight
and with that we have roman who'd like
to share a few things we just finished
celebrating the everscale second
anniversary
at everpoint uh in bali which was
awesome it was a great event
a lot of engaging panel discussions and
there were networking events
people from all over came together to
celebrate the first event which seemed
to go just
perfectly
so roman if you're here if you want to
show your screen or some
photos videos highlights or anything
hola
i see him but i can't hear him
roman
roman can you hear us
let me ping him
if he's not ready then um i can move on
to
if we could use the mr
yep yeah i'll do the metaverse thing
let me move
you guys because i can't see my screen
okie dokie
so that is with data i'm going to show
some
screen captures
i took some screenshots during the event
for people who weren't able to
to come and visit
us right there
okay so real quick you see that
on may 7th on saturday we had the
metaverse party in mona which was
awesome it was really fun it was
different way to get together and we had
um
sparta cats we had surf flex uh newmies
and grand bazaar they were all
representing they all had their own vip
booths
let's see here oops frozen so when you
enter there's hostess you can grab a
beer it directs you to grand bazaar you
can pick up the headphones which and it
connects to some i think it was some
music from a party and a pizza that um
our dj set up
you see a lot of people came in i think
there was about 50 overall who came
through i'm not sure if dadar can have
like exact stats though because he owns
this space
um here's an example of the surf
surf vip booth which is really cool
and
uh the founders of everex were also
there um as interactive avatars so if
you go to them and click on them they're
like these easter eggs which we can
drive to
twitter accounts um basically anything
so this is something that
you find
interesting you could just ping one of
us and we'll set it up
this is one of the ways that we could
build out the space later on
and
this is a funny picture from
eugene's party in mexico he was
celebrating and you could see that they
were also in the
metavirus pretty cool
and um
yeah those are just some pictures
from that i think data also wants to
oops
froze
uh i think data also wants to share a
bit um
if i can unshare now
hold on okay got that
and also down the line we'll be working
on integrating everscale wallets with
mona so you can connect your ever wallet
instead of like a meta mask or something
like that
and buy
nfts directly which is really cool
um
yeah and that was that was the first
party
first ever scale party in a metaverse
and i think it went really well so hats
off to data for
basically everything
can you share anything
i just want to thank you for having me
and let me to
build this space and this is a great
experience for me also because it's it's
my second metaverse done for uh for
someone other than me and uh yeah i
think i i think i like it and i will
continue to build a metaverse for
anyone who
who want a who
can uh propose something more
interesting
i'm actually still in the metaverse
we got some problems i think with
synchronization uh like around i think
the last time he got some problems with
uh
with the synchronization of
images but now i think all must
working
as it
must
and
yeah if you if you have any idea what i
can do what the heck what feature i can
integrate like
the last time i thought it will it can
be interesting to ask the dj to change
the music actually i um i just shut out
the music but
there is uh there is one uh
that ron asked me to integrate so
this one will uh still forever uh until
we uh
we integrate another into it
yeah cool this is a really awesome space
and it's only going to get better we
could start exploring
um metaverse amas for example
presentations vip rooms and there are
portals that people
can
purchase from dadar and he can help you
build out your own vip room
so from the everest ever bar i think
that's the name now from the ever bar
yeah there's there's a room and you
could
you can claim that space build your own
vip room which is really awesome
there's no image here so uh there is uh
just a little space where you can invite
your uh your partners to talk about uh
business and uh
uh
some deals in the metaverse eh exactly
yeah
and yeah
uh eugene you've got a question i saw
your hand go
i think you're on mute or you have no
audio
i can't hear you
[Music]
you do sign language
while he sorts his audio out my
questions very quick dada um you
mentioned a load of examples do you
think uh the metaverse space might be
appropriate for a uh british style pub
quiz podcast hosting at some point
because i think that'd be a lot of fun
if you'd be up to helping me do that i i
think it can be a great idea still i
need to integrate more beers from
england
yes i'm sure i can help you find all the
beers we need but yeah
great stuff
i'm a big fan of uh
um i know it's a it's a irish beer so
it's not the same
um
what is name no guinness guinness yes a
big fan of good old guinness
yeah everyone loves a good guineas
excellent oh yeah i'll be in touch then
buddy
okay
so um
i heard from roman that he doesn't have
a good connection right now but if
anybody
uh eugene did you sort it out
no i didn't hear you maybe you could
type something type your question if you
want
but in in the meantime if um maybe alex
you were at you were at every point in
bali i can certainly say a few words
indeed uh
first of all the level of organization
was very high so thanks to the um to the
brooks's team and their partners who
who
obviously
made a phenomenal effort i mean it was
like absolutely world class in terms of
quality of organization entertainment
like i mean anything could
could end with the quality of
organization any top conference in the
world so it's not tier two it's like
real tier one
uh content i mean it was a first shot
there were four panels basically in a
few speeches
i thought it was pretty good you know
cbdc panel was good the indonesian
market panel was quite interesting that
was actually really interesting
um
so i think for the first time for the
first whole conference not organized by
professional
organizers it's
even the content was quite good
and then of course tons of networking i
mean people were
there were tons of crazy pictures you
know
talking
jumping into the swimming pool fireworks
it was really really hot i think we made
a lot of noise in asia
there were i would say half of the
audience about 100 people out of 200
were from asia which i think is very
good except south korea i don't think we
ever had uh
had
the focus and there were folks from the
philippines obviously with local folks
from japan
so i think
i think we did the big splash and uh
there were folks saying that when we're
now asian blockchain which i think is an
overstatement
it certainly helps to grow that
strategic uh
strategic market because if you look
about in indonesia for example you kind
of don't think about that but it's 270
million people with very good
penetration of crypto so uh i mean it's
like not not the us but but but it's
kind of you know it's kind of there in
terms of at least the market potential
and then you have of course all of the
other markets which are smaller
philippines is about half of the asian
crypto market
uh asean i should i should be more
specific market no not including
obviously china and india et cetera
um
and uh i think that's just a great start
i think we'll have to continue that
every year i'll probably consider next
year something like i know miami or
dubai some acknowledge someone some
acknowledge crypto hub
where and probably a little bit more
central to the world because
everybody loves bali but that's a bit
exotic of course although beautiful i
have to say yeah so when we just you
know keep running and keep going country
by country uh there are a lot of follow
ups there were tons of grant
applications like i sent i think
only myself wasn't like five links for
chop life or grunts and for sure
everybody else did the same so
yeah yeah we're certainly going to see
some increased traction we're unlucky a
little bit with the market you know
because um the market is pretty
rough in the last 72 hours but uh yeah
but um
but that's okay you know that's crypto
is very cyclical
so um i don't know if anybody wants to
say
more than that who was there but um
yeah i think on the scale of one two
five this is like five i mean it's
it's not even five minus it looked
awesome from the pictures and videos i
saw you mentioned that people were
jumping into the pool and i want to see
that i want to see if there's any
pictures of that i'm sure i saw pictures
of mermaids somewhere i saw this but
maybe like alex was wasted and he like
you know skinny dipped or something
i was
one of the few people who did not touch
mermaids or jumped into his head
i was
networking and bringing people into our
ecosystem
was having a couple of drinks along the
way but that was the second prayer it's
not not the first priority yeah yeah
well it sounds fantastic i hope that
there are recordings of the talks and
the presentations
yeah i'm sure they'll i know there'll be
films uh
i'm sure there are some sort of
a whole bunch of pictures and videos uh
available some of it was in our social
media so
i mean yeah it's again i would say
thanks to the brook system and their
partners locally they uh they have a
couple of local partners we did a
tremendous job so
yeah so it's a benchmark set next year
is going to the top whoever does it
all right
i'd definitely uh double up your vote
for portugal joe if
it's a good good crypto hub
yeah inexpensive too we make it next to
the salon or something
yeah yeah there's a lot of activity
there
yeah
yep that's kind of a short version but i
think um
i wouldn't spend more time on this
okay to execute all the questions that
was discussed
cool thank you very much alex for
filling us in
we'll move on to a presentation from the
community it's an awesome project to
share with you
um from the everdues labs the team
behind everdues
they are a recurring payments protocol
and a subscriptions marketplace and we
have sam here
one of the everdues core developers to
tell us more
welcome
hi all
hello
the first thing i want to
remember that ever use is a like last
method use we just renamed a few weeks
ago because when we were in a ibc show
in dubai we just got a lot of comments
is that something connected with
metaverse or not and
that's why we just decided to move to
revered use do not like mix that stuff
so
right now we are ever use one of the
projects who received a grant from
the file lines
and yeah it's uh
then during this meeting i will share
some updates with you
like our status our next steps will show
you a small very short demo
uh so let's get you started
um
first of all overuse yes is the
recurring payment protocol and
subscription marketplace so the first
thing is the protocol which um
using
it you can authorize the merchant to
pull funds from the crypto walls of
customers at regular intervals for some
services and goods so is it's a protocol
which are tries again merchant to pull
funds from customers wallets
and another entity is a subscription
marketplace um
it's a web 3 application built on top of
the protocol where you can
like register your service and accept
recurring payments
so it's a user interface to the protocol
and what is our status right now we just
finished the second milestone of our
grant program it's a smart contract
parts we published them on our public
github
so and we are waiting for a review from
like our partners
uh like from
it's not the
security audit it's a review first but
then we will go ahead the audi we also
improved our marketplace user interface
we added deposits from different
networks so we can deposit uh any
kind of assets from
different networks using octa's breach
to pay for
recurring payments
um we also finished our white paper and
economics so you can go to our website
and browse search for
for this
and also you will find there are some
instructions how to use a protocol how
to use a marketplace
and one more big announcements
announcement that we developed the
telegram membership board so if you have
a public private
not public if you have a private channel
or group you can use our bots to
subscribe to your content
so please welcome uh to summarize all
that updates we have a better version
running on mainnet right now
and if you have any business utilizing
recurring um like payment model
subscription model you're welcome to to
the
our marketplace our website
uh to
like check all of that i will show you a
short very short demo how to look like
right now there you can find the
information let me share the screen
please
probably you can
see it right now
yep
yep looks good ah okay cool
this is our website everyoneviews.com
here you will find
marketplace link link to the docs
there you will find the white paper
link here and all the information about
how the protocol works
overview and then you will find
how to use a marketplace as a service
provider so if you want to accept
recurring payments or for subscribers so
all the instructions are here they are
not
like too large they are very simple
instructions for telegram membership
both linked to the boat so and so on
please browse and
yeah enjoy it
probably
someone you find useful information here
another link is a contact to form to
contact our team with any question and
the most interesting part is the
marketplace
it's here i can
[Music]
click in
[Music]
and you will show
uh we will see here a few cases we
launched during the
anniversary party it's like our kit
private
channels
russian and english one
yeah it's our like first users they
already got the first feedback from
our kit team and so you can also go
ahead register your service and give us
a feedback using our contact form so
marketplace is a catalog of all the
services registered here you can
navigate to the service
push subscribe
and then
for example it's in telegram
use case you can put the telegram name
here and subscribe to the channel
receive the link and go ahead so any
kind of business can be registered in
the marketplace if just
the only one
like who i don't know it's not the
condition but to the requirement you if
you want to
get a recurring revenue so based on
subscription mode
the flow is very simple you just need to
go to the wallet tab deposit some gas
universe and deposit
some usd if you want to subscribe to
some um
to some service if you just want to
register a service you need to some gas
to do that
one more um announcement
right now here
we will add after exchange uh probably
in next two weeks and it will be only
one button to deposit funds like usdt
the iup and another stable coins and all
the fees will be exchanged automatically
so user will not be required uh do not
require to
deposit gas by himself so yeah and
that's our like milestone after that we
will go to the
like public audience right now it's an
announcement inside the community
because they know how to use a ever
wallet how to deposit gas and so on so
during this weeks we are going to test
all that stuff and then make a big
announcement of our marketplace to all
our channel and resources so if you have
a
some errors on the balance you can go to
service tab a click register button
and
complete this form like
found a category name
period in which you want to get payments
for price the period and the
currency to whatsapp payments after that
you will have been appearing in the
catalog here and your potential
subscribers will be
um
confined
they can subscribe to our service and um
yeah it's a
it's an instruction how it works so
also
then you create a service um you've got
the link this link you can put to your
um
like to your
underground to any of your public
resources
and um
and uh sorry forgot the password that
account
uh yeah and um
yeah and to just uh got some subscribers
from other uh kind of
like resources
yeah and our next steps again is to
complete all the auto exchange stuff
after that making the public
announcements uh launch your talking
sales also like private round and uh
round one ever start
and
[Music]
yeah so if you feel like your strategic
support can be useful and profitable
please also contact us on our forum
and the main call is
let's test it we are welcomed for
everyone just to create a service try to
subscribe uh put
any ideas contact us so
yeah it's some kind of finalization
stage between the public announcement
also
um
also you can test our robot
here
on average use for example this is my
subscription i can equal start
call show my active subscription and see
that okay i have our kit private blue
subscription
but my link is already generated
and i already joined this private
channel so
yeah we are like welcoming everyone to
test all of that and let me get your
feedback thank you so much
great thank you very much sam thanks for
sharing all that um everdues.com that's
that's really cool uh so yeah
everybody go to everdues.com test it out
try it out um
yeah and help make it
a really great product
does anybody have any questions
for sam i didn't have a question i just
wanted to say um i know you guys faced
uh some tough questions in the actual
community chat about the product and the
service and you know the whats and the
whys in the house and yeah just wanted
to uh say you know congratulations and
really really well done on you know
handling that really professionally and
stuff
so thank you thank you

network networks all the
subscriptions bots etc all works
probably fine
