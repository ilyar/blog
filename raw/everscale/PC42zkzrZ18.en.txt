so if you can please everybody uh
camera's on
share all our faces with the world
and we can begin
groovy
oh
okay there's youtube
all right
okay welcome everybody there's so much
to share with you today we have a great
lineup of presentations
and updates from the community about our
partnership with bsn and much more
broxas posted a last call to participate
in their elysium hackathon which kicks
off
this week on the 14th it's going to be
very exciting and there's no cost to
join there's a prize pool of 30k at
stake as well
um
also you can join in person or online
and as vlad pointed out last time that
you don't even have to be a developer to
join there's a competition for designers
as well
so
you have nothing to lose go check it out
and we'll drop the uh
okay
so okay i know that many of you have
been asking in the chats for some everex
updates some developer updates from
everex and i wanted to cover that
quickly and mentioned that we have been
really busy but for good reasons and
we'll have
a big update published on the 15th so
stay tuned
and additionally if you have not noticed
yet the everscale news channel in
telegram has now has the blue verified
check mark and this will help prevent
spreading any scammy or
spammy content which is great great news
everybody
so let's kick off the call and moving on
to the agenda we have the first speakers
who are crypto rat
they are a new grant winner from the
everscale defy alliance and they are
setting a new foundation
for a web 3ai layer and you can also
earn money by renting out your
computational power
so we have the core team here with us
today that's andre igor and dimitri who
will
i think do a quick presentation and
share with us some more information so
sure sure let me start
uh so i'll talk just a bit about our
project and give you a short uh
short primer to
prepare you for our future content so
first of all i want to talk about what
we are not instead of talking about what
we actually are
so the most important part is that we
are actually not a web-free project so
we are we're not focused on crypto and
we are not crypto experts ourselves so
we come from ai background and we did
like acid tone of air research of
development of machine learning models
in our lifetime
uh so we bring a
breath of fresh air into your ecosystem
by focusing on classic web 2 businesses
so we are building a software
for people who build and deploy ai apps
so basically we build
we are building a cloud platform
for data scientists so for people who
like trains those neural networks which
then i don't know apply masks for to use
snapchat images for example
uh and we sell our product to them for
regular fiat money
we provide them with the convenient
interfaces to deploy their models to the
cloud in a couple lines of code saving
them devops costs and hardware costs
and the only part where um
decentralization technologies come in
is our internal unit economics
so uh our clients don't need to know
 about crypto and they don't need to
about crypto and they don't need to
bother themselves with it
and we use crypto and we use
decentralized programming
to enable better economics for ourselves
so uh we could be completely survivable
even in that
web 2 working over traditional cloud
ranging hardware on traditional clouds
but we want to boost to boost our
earnings and boost our own economy
through exposing ourselves to cheaper
hardware which is located for example at
undervalued local cloud providers at
your own homes and so on
so
we really think that uh the key to
success
in utilizing the web free mechanics is
to expose yourself to conventional money
as much as possible
and to use them just as a tool
to get better
uh
better economics for ourselves so that's
what we do
so um i can dive in for a couple of
minutes into like any part of our
project that you find interesting so
please give me like some direction and
then i will give you
more ideas about what's to come
okay um anybody can chime in anytime
with questions uh but i have my first
question is are there any incentives for
the community to be involved or
interested or
what the community do here
well
the incentives for community are to earn
with us so if you have a like
really high-end hardware of uh like if
you're for example have like a really
small cloud of
of yourself or you have
a really powerful gaming or artist rig
at home
uh will provide you with the capability
to rent it out for to us to run our
computations and we will pay for that
right now our
unit economics allows us to pay
at least twice as much as you would earn
from mining that's uh that's the minimum
that we target
and we want to
give
like almost
10 x to our top tier members who will
provide us with long streaks of
uninterrupted uptime
okay
well that's interesting
uh
what kind of rewards are given out like
10 times what is it only in fiat will it
be in everest or can you we think that
uh since uh you're basically investing
your time into our ecosystem you invest
your gpu which you purchased for dollar
for us dollars into our ecosystem we
don't pay encrypt we pay well we pay we
deliver our usd payments in crypto
through stable coins but all our rewards
are paid out in us dollars so we are not
going to launch our own token anytime
soon and we don't don't don't think that
it's even needed at all
okay
um
does anybody have any questions for
andre here
i haven't seen any okay is there
anything else you would like to share
with us
well not really
we will definitely
publish our light paper which will
describe how our better version will
work in a couple of weeks
and we are aiming to launch a beta
where you
would be will be able to join
uh and earn money with us uh in
september somewhere in september okay
that's our target yeah that would be
nice to see a demo
like a dashboard uh see how it works
what the user would see
it will uh uh the demo will be deployed
as a cross-platform of windows or linux
app we should go which you will be able
to install it will be a nice and pretty
app mostly focused on
a younger audience of gamers
and that's it
okay
okay thank you for sharing if we have
any questions then i'll uh i'll let you
know
you know um
bring it to you guys okay
maybe maybe something will pop up soon
so okay moving on the agenda we have
identic space they were another grant
winner and they've recently released new
quests we've already done some initial
quests like installing a wallet
um
completing an exchange operation and
things like that but let's see what else
we can learn about and
benefit from
so
is the identics team here
i can't hear you i think you're on mute
hear me yes i mean
now
let me arrange my screens to see myself
in all of you
uh
it's a good to see
you all again thanks for having me here
the first time it wasn't much i guess i
showed you working prototype
on our stage server
and today i'll show you a fully
functional version of our product with
the
quests
[Music]
for on
products on average scale blockchain
and uh just to remind you what
identicspace is in the first place so
this is a project that offers a new
crypto naive users to learn crypto
technologies and web3 tools in a simple
educative gamified quest form
a user receives a task with estimation
how much time it will take to get
through it like usually it takes from 5
to 15 minutes
an idea on about the price or reward he
can get from uh
from this quest
uh he can watch a video where someone
gets through all the steps of the quest
and reads the steps
step-by-step guide or instructions with
screenshots and all the necessary links
and tools are there in the instruction
and all the user has to do is to repeat
what is written or shown
using the web3 tools mentioned in the
quest
and during the quest will help users
both from instruction with instructions
and never sleeping support
to understand terms and concepts and
tools installation configuration and
transaction and all this stuff
a simple short task
with a modest but real significant
reward and cryptocurrency and the
gamified approach to present complex
information this is the concept of learn
to earn that we promote in contrast to
platform where users learn to perform
similar monk actions uh not related to
education and the repetition of which
leads to an increase in balance but not
in their experience and knowledge so we
promote learning instead of playing and
our clients are wipe three companies
ordering or sponsoring quests for
learning and preparing power users
and uh our quest to educate new crypto
new users turning them into power users
not only with a set of personal data
social networks and behavioral models
but also with the setup rich web3
profiles with experience reputation of
knowing how to use web3 tools with high
level of loyalty as clients to project
contributing to the quest and this
experience is confirmed by web3
blockchain transactions to date we have
developed two quests let me share my
screen
[Music]
if i can do this
um
yeah desktop one desktop two
i guess
this one is good
yeah i think you can see my screen yeah
that looks good
yeah
[Music]
so we have developed two quest lines
with basic operations for training and
boarding into polygon and neverskate
blockchain
and my presentation
is dedicated to
everscale of course
so we start from the starting screen
with the big button
start the quest
and uh
then you go through and more on boarding
scenario where the users
who use your registers
and receives the idea digital identity
which is
a unique
uh
identification
that we
which is created using the fsk
blockchain so it is unique with the
signature on blockchain
and the wallet address and other
information including quest experience
rewards received behavior and so on are
subsequently linked to this dit
and during
the quest user receives tokens and send
tokens to
so now i'm registering to
a small capture needed to avoid
bots
since a while we had
we had have we have had this crowd of
bots
trying to
get our money
for free so we have to include some
measures
against them
so here we are on the menu screen where
you can see that there is a scale quest
line
with the five quests uh
yes uh with five quests
ready to be passed
beginning with our wallet installation
i'll show you the simple walkthrough
without registering and making the real
transactions on the blockchain because
user's actions are synchronized with the
blockchain transaction so to save time
we want to they wait for everything to
be in
registered in
in blockchain and verified by our
backend so here we see the instruction
with screenshots
and
once we are through this we get the
congratulations screen
with the instruction what's the next the
next step is connecting the wallet to
identicspace
it still asks me to do some additional
steps to
to get my social media accounts
we connect the wallet to identicspace
it says that i will get 100 experience
and plus
forever
token
[Music]
short introductory introductory screen
then we just connect our wallet to
identicspace platform to a track
transaction related to this to my uh
blockchain address have a wallet address
so we get through a simple signature
process
once we're there we can do more some
more complex tasks
with higher rewards
let's me
oh no i know
so we connect identic space everything
is okay we go back to the
quest page
and
go through the instruction and say next
and here we are
with connection congratulations and
promise to send forevers to my connected
blockchain address
and this is
not a reward by itself but this is a fee
needed to fulfill the next steps more
difficult ones so the truth
[Music]
that requires
money to uh
to make a transaction like swap
uh here you see we promised not only
ever talking but also some
one good talking this is a specifically
created
technical token to
teach user to swap
without giving the real value tokens so
we created a pair of two tokens wingo
and one go
that
used to
give this practical hands-on experience
of swapping and heading to liquidity
pools and
at the last step farming
lp tokens
so here one one more instruction
to
show users what to do to swap from one
go to wingo
and
we consider it is made on uh
on the
blockchain on the flat cube
platform
uh here we have to add the wingo token
to our wallet to see that we have it on
our balance
oh we go through it once again
and
here we are
finally we are the third part of the
quest and we can swap finally one token
to another
we open the usual flat cube
swapping interface
selected token
we search for one go
one go
i have one thousand and one go
usually we give it
um
and the window
so i swap 100 to
one go
and
i sign the transaction
i paid the transaction fee
yeah this is it
we are dependent on the blockchain
transaction oh no i forgot to put my
password here
sometimes it takes time
waiting for a transaction and never
scale blockchain usually it's a
lightning fast but sometimes we can't
even
create the id
waiting for transaction
great
result
and we can go back to
our
quest page
and
say next
go into the next
stage first congratulations and
some rewards and the next
stage of the
quest line
liquidity pools
here it might be
more difficult because the
quest is
more complex than simply swapping
user has you have to understand the the
the model of first of of liquidity pools
and we explain everything trying to
take some metaphors from the real time
not blockchain life
uh
explaining like it's like banking but
different same same but different
and then we begin some preparatory steps
like adding the pools adding liquidity
to rules adding tokens and finally uh
going through this uh
liquidity pool
adding tokens and getting a liquidity
pool token to further reform them on the
fifth stage of the quest line
so it might take some five
from five to ten minutes more
to show you
uh all other
remaining quests
so i want to save our time everything
works you can
try after the presentation by yourself
and get some cubes
as interest from my liquidity talking
farming
to date we have uh 10 quests uh in total
for polygon and uh everscale
uh more than 500 accounts users
went through every scale quest at least
one at least once
and more than 1700
transactions
on different
quests were
done by users
so not many but well the the model is
proved and the users are coming to our
quest
uh
trying to
this gamified experience of
learning the blockchain tools and
web3
ways of earning by learning
so that's it for the moment if you have
any questions i would be
i'd be happy to
answer if i can
uh
also we
submitted our code
the open part of the code
to github we can check it at
identicspace github i'll share this link
with you
well that's it
thank you awesome thank you
thank you very much daniel i do have a
question will you be implementing um a
functionality to
log into the platform without sharing
user data
this is where we began
we wanted to give them a possibility to
log in without sharing data
and
we got into troubles with it because web
3 registrations it exists but it is uh
full with
abuse from the part of some abusive
users and now we're trying to uh
trying to fight with them uh by
introducing some more
personal
approaches getting the personal data of
for of at least twitter account
and facebook account it might be not
your real account but it it it makes uh
the entrance to the uh
quest
more expensive
to take more time
to avoid abuse from uh from the
from the side of those abusive users
i understand so we are on the way to
experiment with this web 3
uh non-personal date registration but
well it
it is
it is full of bad guys still what about
logging in with a verified address
with a verified address like a very very
listed address
thinking about this
at the same time thinking about 2fa
registration
well there are some some
some good things and bad things about uh
either of uh options and who i tried to
weigh
everything you know
we are giving rewards to users without
getting kyc or whatever
really personal information so it's like
giving money for free
and
we have to
we have
to figure out how to uh
to make our money safe and to buy real
users not to buy but to teach real users
and not the bots or
some very
smart guys smart assets that want to
take out to take our money for just just
because it is there yeah
i understood are you guys doing any
marketing for this because i'm sure a
lot of people are you know googling
every day how to earn crypto get free
crypto and quests for crypto and things
like that
yes slowly but surely we were trying to
do some marketing and uh
every day there are some
up to 100 new users who are getting from
uh advertising
from
some advertising channels
uh there are some difficulties on for
advertising social media as you all know
and
[Music]
we're thinking about some
campaign uh
collaboration campaigns with influencers
but still we were in testing period we
didn't want to get 1000 users at the
same time and be just blocked by amount
of users so we're
slowly but surely going there
yeah
completely understandable yeah okay
that's a fantastic presentation great
project thank you very much for thank
you
thank you
uh so we're going to move on to
grand bazaar the team behind grand
bazaar has been quite busy these days
especially with the latest gleam
competition update of the tip four
standard and of course the new nft
merchants that look super cool so lucky
for us we have pablo smirnoff with us
today to bring us up to speed
hi pablo
hello everyone i hope everything is
correct and you can hear me
yeah
so that's great
uh first of all thank you for invitation
and today i'm gonna share
several important news from the gun
buzzer
the first one yeah it's about the
merchant nft collection and the second
one is uh
about the tip for nft standard
i will start with the merchants
um yeah
i'm gonna can you let me
the option to show you then you're still
sharing your screen yeah i would like to
share my screen
daniel
daniel you there
we need you to stop showing this yes yes
i'm there i'm trying to figure out how
it is okay stop chevron i figure out how
to pause the sharing but it doesn't want
me to
stop ah yeah here it is there you go got
it i did it thank you
so
actually you can see the screen right
yes all good oh that's great
yeah
our second bling glim competition was
finished and after
that all of the merchants were minted
out so the last merchant was minted at
sunday morning
and
at this time the floor price is about 40
hours
last weekly call i
briefly told you about the merchant
benefits such as airdrop of our future
native token but i didn't show you
[Music]
in my opinion the core features that
make this collection is
more unique than other collections such
for example
it's jlb format yeah
you can fully interact with your
merchant
and
you have to click on the format here is
gpg format just
the command picture and here is a
3d
merchant uh in the future we will let
this option the option to mint uh
nft in
glb format to every user
yeah
so from
the start of the marketing
campaign of the merchant nfts
we increased our
unique users from the several thousand
to
it's about 15 000 at this moment
yeah
and the second important news that i
want to share with you is
tip for nft standard when you visit
grand buzzer
main page or other page you will see
this banner
that tell us that we are completely
switching to the new nft standard tip
four and this is the first available for
the all users tip for standard
implementation in the world every scale
like a system
as you know our marketplace already has
two collections largest on
this standard it's scale banks and grand
bazaar merchants
they also preparing uh
different features on this
standard such as nfts taken and
reward system and much much more uh
moreover user collection in t4 standard
will be on chain collections and it
means that
they will exist not only on grand bazaar
but on
other wallets or
third-party services
it's important to know that
nfts on the previous standard
are still displayed on our marketplace
they still it's still available to buy
or sell them
but
collections on the previous standard
will no longer be able to be updated
with new nfts
and
the tip for standard
is made in partnership
of it gold and nft alliance
in the end of july we will publish the
smart contracts
so you can check every detail of every
contract by
your own
so
thank you so much that's all
thanks for attention
thank you for that presentation
um do you happen to know the size of the
glb
size yeah no yeah
one more time i'll show my screen
you can check it there so there will be
a format okay
oh okay yeah
in the card of nfc on our marketplace
yeah
cool
thank you very much thank you i hope all
of you already minted or purchased one
of them
so welcome to the grand bazaar family
yeah
thanks
does anybody have any questions for
pavel
i don't see anything popping up
no okay well maybe later on we'll have
some questions
thank you very much
uh and next on our agenda we're going to
be talking about our partner bsn zachary
lee is with us today and he has an
update
about the blockchain service network
so welcome zachary nice to see you again
hi nice to see you guys
uh okay i'll just give a uh two minutes
quick updates on what where we're going
and where we are on bsn
and as you probably will some of you
were already aware with
the bsn basically is something initiated
by
chinese state it was called the state
information center
sic
and they basically some state-owned
government departments
and they're they're running something
called blockchain
service network and average scale is
actually one of their
very important partners and we've
already
go live with one of the the product
which is called the open permission
blockchain
and now we're working on the next one
which is more exciting one it's called
ddc integration and basically the ddc
stands for the decentralized uh digital
uh sorry this decentralized digital
certificate which is basically just the
equivalent of nft
because the nft is
a kind of a little bit sensitive in back
in china so that's why bsn they adopted
a new terminology called ddc
and now
thanks to the new standard which is the
tip four and now we we have an
equivalent of erc 721 on every scale so
that's right now our team is working
very hard on integrating
this tip in 4.1
with the current ddc
specification
so and and we've already have a lot of
help and support from everex team
and other teams on every scale community
and now hopefully i think we can get
something ready next week
and
for the ddc and once this up and running
on bsn average scale network inside of
china
mainland then
we we hopefully can get some real good
top brand like ip
and brands they can doing minting of rft
or what we call the ddc
on bs and our scale network
and that would be a very important way
to to demonstrate our
wonderful thorough put and tps
by the way so currently
now that is quite popular for ddc in
inside of china
and one of this obb chain they freddie
maintain over i think four million
rft or ddc
just in in june
and but but due to the the low
throughput and tps
so that blockchain is already in huge
country congestion
and that's why we think it's a great
opportunity to demonstrate our uh
strength
yeah so
let's just wait and see whether we can
we can do a a a better debut in china
yeah
okay that's all of it
that's great
it sucks for them but that's a pretty
good for us
um is there any do you
currently have any conversations with
any of these top brands in the pipeline
are you scoping them out or has anything
even started
yeah okay yeah so it's actually not us
to to tax based on all these top brands
ips
is actually all those um what's it
called the like uh an empty marketplace
just like opacity and foundation so like
on global blockchain space
so here we've already have a handful of
uh
a big nfd marketplace in china and they
basically can connect it to any of this
bsn ddc
standard blockchain yeah
so once we're ready and they finally
have lots of this and huge brands and
eyepiece
uh piping up and queuing up just waiting
for a
better blockchain with higher throughput
interesting very good keep us updated on
that that's that's very interesting
okay no problem
does anybody have any questions for
zachary and about
bsn nope
okay
thank you very much we shall move on to
everboard everkit launched a new service
called everboard which is a snazzy new
token exploration interface and we have
alexandra here with us today to tell us
more
hi alexander nice to see you
nice to see you thank you for
opportunity to present everboard
let me share my screen one second
to see everything by yourself yes can
you see this
okay so uh let's start the development
of a device service which will provide
users with functional narrative
analyzing every scale tokens as well as
monitoring the asset portfolio was
planned as a part of the ground received
by the arrow key team from the fire
alliance
on july 8 the arrow key team presented
the everboard service to the community
which is made in the usual arcade design
we are on the main page now and you can
see a summary of all every scale tokens
uh you can see data on gainers and user
stops here per day new tokens trading
volume how many tokens were blocked if
you choose for example one certain token
you can see historical graphs
on several indicators the current
looking rate information standard and so
on
also there is a favorite section on the
website so you just can choose the token
click here
and it will appear on your favorite
section
here users can add tokens for easy
tracking
to find the desired token on the service
you can use a search engine
which is located right on the top uh all
articles about uh tokens in every scale
published by the everky team were
implemented in this service
so to find the list of articles will be
renewed so users can be aware of
up-to-date information
the service will be updated so in future
versions community members will be able
to use
a portfolio you can see here portfolios
soon uh where the composition and value
of assets will be displayed
also on the website you will be able to
see the display over every scalar system
and including various indicators for d5
projects and the rating system and i can
say that very will be not only d5
projects but just like projects of every
scale at all
by the way you can edit your own token
on the ever board service to do this you
need to fill out a form published on the
arrow key telegram channel
thank you for your attention that's all
okay thank you very much for sharing
that it looks great alexandra um
is there anything else on the roadmap
that you could share with us like for
example are you guys maybe thinking
about
creating widgets or
part of the website to implement onto
for now i talked with our developers for
now it's on the stage of discussion so
uh for now our first stage next is about
projects as i said about the fire rating
and so on and i think right after it yes
we will discuss favor updates but for
now i can't say anything about it but of
course the service will be updated
cool it would be great to see it on
other websites like news sites or
whatever
okay cool
yeah great any questions for
about everboard for alexandra i don't
see anything
okie dokie
um and that's it for our presentations
if anybody has any questions you should
chime in now
i'll check there's nothing in the chat
so i don't think so
um alrighty then thank you everybody for
joining and it's wonderful to see your
faces and have a great rest of your week
see you guys in the chats
bye guys
