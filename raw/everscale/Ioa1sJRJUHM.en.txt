uh
hello everyone hello
[Music]
the usual we wait for one more minute
and we'll start
i prepared some description for stage
for stable coin contest
in chat maybe somebody reads
too near to the end of our meeting and
i propose that you i will just give you
some time at the end of the meeting and
you will
just explain
what you wrote
[Music]
okay not so many of us today
all right so let's start in any case
so welcome everyone to our 25th weekly
governance call of the defy group of the
free tone
and we have not that big agenda for
today but still
let's go through it so first
and it's very important question so we
need to schedule the payment session
but i don't see much of governance
members today
attending the call and i think that we
will do this
uh in the in the chat uh alexander are
you available tomorrow
uh evening or to today evening
which time is better for you to arrange
the payment session
um if you talk about me today i'm
ready for all day or better
in monday if not today okay okay
today on monday brilliant uh i will just
drop it in the payment chat and we will
just
ask everyone which time is better
next topic on the agenda is a
bitcoin bridge discussion actually we
have touched it
slightly uh quite a long time ago so now
it
it's time to discuss it again and
approach
to the launching of this contest uh i
know sergey
and shasha wanted to say for words about
this so sega please
hello yeah hi
yeah yeah hello i'm sorry i need i need
a few minutes because
uh a lot of people in the room
okay no problem i hope that we will just
uh take this time
alexander i propose maybe uh that you
start with
your proposal on staging so when you can
just use this time to describe
and explain yes because
not so much
define participants here i said it's
more
for recording and somebody will
listen because that
i will not explain what i offer
in every stage
we talk about contest stablecoin contest
[Music]
do this contest now
everybody is so busy with
dex contents bridges and
other mechanisms and entity markets
to now start this hype
okay but uh stablecoin we really needs
a free tone need uh and stablecoin
and um was um
hard decision how to share
with stages and
um here
in the chat in in the draft documents
um i suggest to have uh first
four stages uh it's us
we fold and recommend for
every development every implementation
yes
we think that it's a good idea to do it
in some stage
for example info and here alpha version
uh and uh most important in this
version we did mechanism for
stabilization
stable coincidence itself and
stabilization mechanism
and testing environment
for testing stabilization
it will be price
the stabilization important thing uh for
your attention
it's uh um i offer
um one criteria for first stage
uh to do um
[Music]
description uh that every participant
uh needs to describe what they will do
on the next first stage what they done
on this stage will be do
all the next three stages why because
um okay i describe what
uh we think possible to do on the next
stage
but uh if we looked to
submission from design
contest for stable coins it was very
different
uh submission very different mechanism
and sometimes
uh it's impossible to have some
mechanism for example
in the beta version next stage uh second
stage
i offered to do oracle's mechanism
but for example for uh
algorithmic stable coins sometimes it's
doesn't mean they do it's a different
way
because that um we offer
uh four stages uh second about oracle's
third it's mvp
a product where we have and uh stable
coin mechanism stabilization
and um oracles and
all this connected and work together
it's on the third stage and on the
fourth it's finished product
uh with um all the both ux
and all voiting or dao digital
generalized automation organization
mechanism
it's mean that very important on the uh
last
fifth stage uh stable code
should be driven by decentralized
mechanism
if of course it's not type one stable
coil take
and this is all uh
everybody needs to look attently read
and suggest
the but one
very important thing
for your attention it's as i said
on the first stage we offer that
every participant participants
need to give their own
road map for next stage and
i recommend to discuss it's in
jury group or in our defy group
uh discuss those stages before
the before they put their submissions
in blockchain this is uh that
very different from previous web video
because
uh that we need to discuss it's good
idea or not
that's okay okay uh
actually uh i agree that uh we need
some kind of milestones for
for this contest so it probably it will
be the same chained cost
contest as we used to have for bridges
for example
uh uh yeah so we have meter raise hand
so
media please yeah well the architectures
are
very different at least from like our
architecture with andrew
is very different from like others
the question is like okay so we um
let's say we uh we do this you know
uh proposal with the stages these stages
will be entirely different from
other participants what you're going to
do with them next
yeah that's actually the questions that
i also had in mind so that uh
uh i'm not sure if uh there should be
three or four maybe
only two stages uh so we don't unders we
won't understand this
and unless the first implementation
is uh is done uh
maybe maybe we can somehow try to
uh tackle more generic
stages for each you know
each and also stable coins
i don't know so the first version was
manually uh
stabilized price second version with i
don't know automatic stabilized price
and third version with
with dao inside uh i don't know
so we need to discuss need to think
about this and
maybe it's it's worth to uh
i don't know actually i mean yeah media
please
i want to lower the hat
okay okay i already did this i keep an
eye on this
uh yeah so uh so anyone please
uh everyone have a look on this proposal
and
give you ideas in text or directly to
alexander
yeah i want to put some words here
because i look to proposal and i have
questions about
about oracle's because oracle's is
important part
for all the phi ecosystem dexes
knitting oracles stable core and ethanol
oracles and i think
that's a good idea set up
contest for oracle's like independent
contest
not inside in stablecoin contest
yeah and actually we had this in our
initial defy
uh roadmap that we presented to the main
governance
and yeah yes i think it's worth it yeah
uh
so maybe i will take care of drafting
this proposal
and so we will post it yeah
we will actually like the the big part
of our
design for stablecoin is an oracle
design so that will already cover
part of implementation for us and we
will
you know gladly participate in that okay
you can even
make it make it draft yourself so if you
wish
oh the contest yeah yeah it's just for
foreign
yeah so please please do so and then
we'll discard this
because you have the actual experience
and understanding of how
how it should be and uh so yeah
it will be a good starting point for
discussion
okay any other opinions guys
yeah i looked at what alexander proposed
and i think that
the easiest thing is yes to combine
maybe
second and third stage uh the third
stage which is finished product
is i think at this stage it can be even
optional
because we don't know what would be
implemented after the third stage and it
can be
changed in the future for sure and i
also agree we should make it
more generic and maybe we should uh
exclude oracle's from alpha stage but
again a lot of
uh proposals that we've saw on the
design
they are heavily dependent on the
oracles
in my case means that uh stablecoin
itself depends on the context for
oracles
if we don't want every participant to
make his own implementation of the
oracles
so it's a good question to think about
for everyone
should we make this contest dependent on
the oracle contest or should we try
to generalize and make it more generic
the healthy stage
i agree okay good idea yeah yeah
i really think that we will uh just face
some
teams con constraints so as we used to
have
uh for the dex contest uh that people
cannot participate
in both contests at the same time and
there is not so many teams
who are able to do this so probably we
should prioritize
oracle's contest first and
right after uh runs the stable
contest yes meter please yeah well
the thing with with oracle's like um
do we need to discuss the architecture
of that first
of course we do so we so the contest
will include like the
the architecture part should include or
just implementation part
as with june i think we can run a short
architecture contest
for just a couple of weeks and
get some results because uh i think
that's for oracle's
part uh it's not more complex than the
dex contest
and uh arguably but
for me like i of course prefer because i
will participate in the architecture
because i think i know how to like
do that but uh you know and but that of
course it depends on
then how the contest should be drafted
so if there is a
first stage with a is there architecture
then then i will just draft this part
the contest and we'll be very proud yeah
i think i think that's the right uh
right step
what do you think guys
i as our pre prior
experience shows that architecture
contests they always give
great insights for every other team on
them green day stage so
if we have time then it's always good to
have an architecture
before implementation okay
then a deal good meet can you please
draft the
architecture contest for oracle yes sure
yeah and we will discard this uh
okay any other opinions
no very good uh okay so
now we will uh start with
sergey report about the tony alliance
news
and then we'll also slightly shift to
the bitcoin bridge discussion
yeah hello everyone uh some news from
uh ton audience uh
we have near five funds uh
ready to provide liquidity
to our bridge visit
to the
system we have some requirements for it
it's about security we did
we had a minimum 10 conversation with
different audit company
who will already do it one of this
company was in
our last call munifi
and also we have two companies already
audit our bridge
it's very difficult for them because
it's not a
simple case it's not about ethereum
smart contracts it's a
different new blockchain and we
developed a lot of different parts
of uh bridge on rust and there are not a
lot of people
who can we did harass components
and i think we will work with them
we will
only in june and so i think
i will call the media about
how to do it not in june maybe maybe
maybe in april um
but yeah because because yeah because
because on the on on the affiliate of
course uh
the initial members of valiants we can
we can put uh some funds before we did
but but of course it will be more safety
for all
do it after we did file
yeah they do talk with sergey is mixed
bytes they do audits
i think that technically i think they
can start earlier
uh with mixed bytes our team will talk
and about about audio on rust
it's not it's not simple for them
for sure and sergey do it i know
i just talked to him okay okay maybe i
should talk with him directly um
okay it's about to edit and also we have
a pipeline
from uh four company uh
ready to build different projects in our
ecosystem
it's a two big players from a fairy
mecca system
and one star's team who want to
create decent decentralizations
launchpad very interesting architecture
we are talking with them and maybe it
will be first company
who will work with the valiants
also we
created bridge update on last
on this week you know yeah on this week
we discovered uh some
issues and we fixed it it was a long
presses
and this is why we moved our listing
continues
up from this week to next week
and so on i hope on next week we will
create listing continuing swap we will
put
liquidity from both sides and
we will understand what people from
dex community will think about
about our work about about
all freedom because all the people don't
know about return
and it will be new and interesting
how we will understand and
about about return on texas it will be
interesting experience for us to
yes also we started creating uh
content about about defined use from our
funds
and uh you don't know what did we put
first yeah we are just finalizing the
text and we'll publish shortly
yes and because we have funds analytics
i talked now about different members of
the valyans we will set
most important things and
put content to our chats all come for
freetown community
so i think in next next call
we will show something
should we should we uh maybe
um create some announcement for listing
on uni swap for the freetown community
so so they could
yes for my side the best announcement
is it will be linked to trading payers
after listing
okay okay but maybe people would like to
you know just
use this opportunity to just put some
liquidity on the uni swap yeah alexander
alexander please alexander
sergey how do you think
maybe maybe it's a little bit uh
need to do later i mean about putting
liquidity
pool yes uh in uni swap
i mean maybe it's
you need to do after that we have decks
on top
i mean looks uh some people uh
understand what is possible comes to
free tone but
they realize that it's possible to do
trading uh
in free tone with less yes
they will do it ah because because we
we want to set up uh some
primitive farming mechanics and
all providers liquidity will get some
crystals but for getting it
we will need install wallets
and we need a discovery photonic system
yes it's if we'll be farming it's a good
idea
yeah of course or without this of course
yes yes
because uh thank you
a lot of liquidity how liquid
independent liquidity
and also some team who created decks
have talked with us about
liquidity for texas and
our answer now will be ready to provide
equity
when decks will be ready
we will test it in trading and
we will create some some audit for its
stuff
and we will already provide up to 100k
liquidity to all vexes
who will really work
okay very good thank you
very good so again maybe you just uh
explain
in a few words on how teams
should apply for this
so should they contact you directly or
maybe go to the site of tony lions to
torque
i'm i i i watching for fall their fold
access for works
and i so only
uh meteor work but it's it's it's near
to production maybe
because it's it will be interesting
experience start trading and so
and so when um when we will
when we will see uh radio rated x in
production
uh we will connect directly
because because i know all teams who are
working on the decks
okay very good
working very hard on that all the time
we'll run today like a video session as
i said
to well posted and we will cover some
additions which are not part of the
contest already which was done
some um like refactoring and
optimizations but uh i think that
yeah i think it's not long time before
it will be ready
okay very good
uh any other any questions guys please
to sergey on the
uh it's an alliance announcement or we
move
next
no very good uh okay so gay you also
wanted
just to ignite uh the discussion
for bitcoin breach so please yes
yes about bitcoin bridge uh
i just remember about it
[Music]
maybe last week a week ago when i talked
with one fund from south korea and
we're talking that guys the main
liquidity active now
am i the only one who don't
just please repeat your previous words
because we didn't hear you
okay uh are you hearing me yes
right now
i have conversation with one korean fund
and we're ready to move a lot of bitcoin
to liquidity infritone because we
are like bitcoin i like freetown
and they don't like ethereum
and beautiful customers
[Laughter]
beautiful customers yes and
and i and we have only draft
and we have no team ready to implement
it
now but i think we should to run
contest and maybe someone
will will implement it
okay okay uh at least there should be is
a contest for design and architecture of
this bridge
because it will be different from
ethereum uh as
as far as i know and uh at least for
this stage we will just test
the how many teams are able to
participate
maybe we can somehow leverage the dune
community as well
with a talented developers and
invite them also to participate uh
of course they are now occupied with a
swap
contest but i think that idea is good
uh meet them maybe you can also say a
few words
so if you plan to participate in this
contest or maybe you know some
someone who can participate
um i i need to well
let's let's first do the architecture
yeah sure but but at least participate
in the architecture
yeah well yes and because we have now
already teams
for it for a contest uh maybe we can
create a problematic article
and uh uh updated on quantity graph
bitcoin or another other partners
and it should be a philosophic article
about bitcoin
about ethereum about friton and about
wisconsin
yeah definitely okay so
uh who can prepare who can draft the
this article
maybe some guys from tony alliance can
do
uh maybe maybe yes maybe yes
uh we will prepare with we will
put it to my task list okay because i i
i yeah we just
very good
okay any ideas on this topic
nothing really guys be more active
please
i know that you are smart guys and you
have your own opinions
just don't don't be shy express yourself
okay no no one wants to be the first one
uh yeah i just just just uh to remind
you that we have already
draft for this contest ready for a long
time so
we just can launch it uh as soon as
possible
so let's drop the article and
synchronize the launch of the contest
together with the publication uh by the
way uh
guys from alliance uh have just uh
published the first news digest in the
definitive
group so you can have a look on it
in fact uh i discussed with them so
there are
so many news so it's it's so hard to
choose which ones are the most crucial
ones
and uh this is just an experiment so uh
i really encourage you to provide your
feedback
so if it's useful for you or not so what
what you would like to see more
or what topics should be covered more
and i think it's versatile for all the
community
uh all right so uh just
uh if we don't have any other questions
uh just a kind reminder to all the
jurors
uh that there is a contest uh
for dexes an index implementation stage
one
that ends in eight days and uh
almost all participants has published
the
video demonstrations and
please have a look on them and provide
me with feedback if you need the ama
session with participants
because i didn't get any feedback from
you so if you don't want
okay that's fine don't let's not waste
time of each other but if you do so
please provide me for your feedback as
soon as possible
because i need to arrange this as well
all right yes anzar please
i have a question about not about the
videos but about the dex contest
uh might be sort of a noob question but
still
uh there's a there's this stage two
stage three
and stage four described in the road map
of the
uh of the stage one um
contest so yeah i wanted to know if
there's like
a draft for the second stage or
or something because it's it's a little
vague
in describing what will
exactly the second stage be about you
mean for the next contest
yes uh well i i will
just share with you my thoughts and
maybe some
some other guys have other opinion in
fact uh we are right now
in quite uh you know as you said vague
environment so
we don't know what will be exactly
implemented uh on the first stage that's
why there are
all these milestones they are quite a
draft ones
and of course they can change over the
time so uh
we will have a look at which solutions
will be the winning ones and also
later discuss what will be the next
stages for
for this contest uh because
as shows the practice uh everything may
change very
very quickly and if we have drafted
some milestones that we currently see
them assist
so they may may change after the
implementation stage
this is pretty much what's happening
with bridges
so although we uh try to stick to all
these milestones that were initially
drafted we see that something
shouldn't be done something should be
added to that
so i propose to discuss after this the
first stage
has ended yes i wanted to add that
uh we are also we are looking at two
things that the results
of course of the first stage and they
will
might affect the
draft of the second stage because we
have to see what
what were the we who were the winners
the best
uh approaches etc that's why uh it was
very
vague uh vaguely described
in the document and the second thing we
have to
prioritize it with uh stable context
because we
again don't want to mix those contents
together
in terms of uh timelines we want them to
be separate because we know there are
several teams who
want to participate in both so we have
to prioritize
uh and i think that the second stage
will be
right after the stable coin i
implementation stage so we
will have plenty of time to discuss it
and
sum up with the best possible draft for
all the teams
okay so yeah did i get can you hear me
now
yeah sure yeah did i get it right so
first uh
the voting for the first stage
ends then there's some discussion time
and
some time for the stablecoin contest
so that it doesn't get mixed with the
with the stage two
right and only then there is stage two
for the decks
right yes yes more or less i think so
it's my proposal but
that's how how i do it yeah we will see
actually we will see so uh because there
is also the oracle's contest that we
discussed
earlier and uh maybe
we will decide that we should not wait
for too long and
announce the second stage as well uh
but yeah so i think it's it's worth to
to wait for one week to er for the first
stage to end and
[Music]
then discuss it precisely okay
okay
what is the second stage that's exactly
what anzuro asks
like we don't have any second stage we
didn't know
we have amm which is okay
which is kind of almost ready next week
is that the amm should be the next stage
yes it's the
let's do it
we can do it without them well according
to the road map
uh which i'm looking at right now that's
listed in the stage one contest
the second stage is uh devoted to
complex liquidity pool mechanics
third one is the complex automated
market maker mechanics
which doesn't really make that much
sense to me
at least i mean it's all like the
advanced functionality of dex and it it
doesn't look like
a um like a big milestone that's
like you reach and then something big
changes
so yeah i just wanted to know if if that
whole thing uh listed in the roadmap
section of the uh
stage one contest is subject to big
change
which i suppose it is and uh yeah i just
wanted to
sort of have like timeline for the
next month or so to understand
if uh well to plan obviously
to understand what's yeah and yeah i
also wanted to
um maybe maybe bring up um
the topic of the criteria for for this
first stage as well as for me personally
uh i think they're not
really it's
they're not really like a set of
criteria that you can easily match with
with the results of the
contest to with the results of the with
the submissions that are
made for this contest to understand if
they match
so it's really hard to for for them to
it's really hard to understand if they
match or not and it's really hard for us
sometimes to understand as as
participants if we match or not it's
easy for like debuts okay yeah the bots
are mandatory
and uh there's uh some support for uh
tip three tokens which
yeah we discussed and it was uh slightly
changed but yeah i just wanted to um
to know if those um if more attention
will be paid to you
to make criteria more easy to understand
yeah you have actually touched two
topics here so the first one
so uh refers to to the judging process
yeah so and that's why uh i asked
everyone to show and explain how the
solution works
because uh judges uh jurors
will be assessing the work
i hope everyone will assess personally
but i hope that
they will be assessing it fairly by by
the spirit of the contest
and the second uh topic is that uh the
contest itself
was formed uh like this because
we had several uh approaches on the
architecture and design stage
that were not pretty similar
uh in the implementation and
guys tried to to make the contest uh
in such a ways to cover all of this so
uh
maybe that causes sometimes uh some
blurry points
uh in in the text but uh if you have any
doubts
so you can you are free to just address
your doubts to
to jurors before they make the decisions
so don't hesitate to do this
i actually don't have doubts about
jurors i just
wanted to for the jurors to be
to not be put in a situation where they
don't
um have more or less
more lack or less exact criteria to to
judge
so just to make it easier for them to
understand what
and bring the most value to you to well
to the community so we have the highest
quality
of course of course in fact uh
when we are talking about some standards
for
judging of course in some time
maybe it will come like best practices
whatever
but uh right now so uh each juror is
independent
and he has his own criteria on how to
judge
uh i personally know at least 10
different approaches and how to assess
different works
because i i am a juror myself and
in several sub-governances and i talked
to the
jury community and everyone just
believes that this or that approach
is most suitable to them but
this is how decentralized judging
works actually so we cannot impose some
standards or whatever on jurors but we
can recommend
and uh and educate if them
don't understand how to do this that's
that's a whole
whole whole big issue so that yeah that
needs to be addressed and
it is addressed systematically in
different subgovernances
yes alexander please
um i want to edit about um
jury for me how i understand
um the biggest problem that
everybody who come and white uh
can see previous voting in one case it's
not so good because he looks for another
opinion and maybe stay
no so independent
i in our case how i understand what we
to do obligatory to waiting and people
stay comes and void it like voted before
another participant before um
when it was obligatory they don't do it
nothing
now they all working but
working in the same way way like
previous
and i think if it will be possible
in the future to do smart contract or
maybe at least front end
where not possible to see marks before
the contest ends um
it will be the same problem if it's
possible to do
[Music]
to
then you can see avoiding
all voiding of all jury participants
only then contest finished
we can will be void
only jury who understand
mechanism and try to
go deeper who didn't know
who don't know will be put up
abstain yeah blind voting yeah
so uh it's one of one of the approaches
uh i personally
think that it is just one of approaches
and
it's uh not the best one not the worst
one so
uh it can work and cannot so we don't we
won't know and unless we try
and i think the
major point here is we need to
grow our best jurors so and educate them
grow them motivate them to
bring the highest standards of judging
and
that's the main point because you
remember that when
some time ago we just decided
to to pay to jurors based on the amount
of work they did
so on how they they voted and
some someone just voted for for one work
and
all others voted for all others and got
the reward proportionally
but it helped a little
but at least now the jurors who
invest their time to assess all works
they feel that they're rewarded more
fairly but i cannot say that
it dramatically increased the
quality of judging itself uh so
i think that we can just elaborate so
several hypotheses on how to improve
judging
and try one one after another and just
find the right solution just with a b
testing
or something like this
thank you okay
uh in fact uh
that's that's pretty it's for today so
alexander just
drop something concern
[Music]
bitcoin return to bitcoin
questions bitcoin i remember that was a
contest for anatomic swap
and now i find it and looks
it was uh about uh atomic swap with
uh bitcoin uh and ethereum
and with bitcoin and pretty good rewards
and
uh it had some submission and
many discussion maybe somebody knows
how it's finished do we have some uh
atomic swap bridge with bitcoin or not
why we discuss
bitcoin
yeah atomic swaps and and bridges are a
bit
different technologies and
they are not even pretty similar to an
implementation
[Music]
on the boss blockchain sites so i
recently discussed with my guys
on our otc solution for atomic swaps
and the implementations that we current
that we had uh
several months ago for bitcoin swap
so uh it doesn't seem so good right now
already
so and that's that's why we are working
it and
hopefully we will also
show it show something in coming months
but the main issue here actually there
is a whole set of
issues linked with atomic swaps uh so
including privacy including uh
how it should be implemented and uh
in both blockchains on the client side
should we use or not some
of chain server sides uh
there's uh a big bunch of questions
arising from it uh
yeah and also technologies don't stand
uh just on one
one place and so they also have
progress and things change
for example uh at that time so
we were targeting uh
signing transactions with hardware like
ledger or trezor then remember exactly
which one
uh but for some reason there were some
changes so
that integration doesn't uh work anymore
so it needs to be upgraded and so on so
forth uh
yeah so actually it's it's a good
product and i hope that we will show
uh some uh updated version soon
uh from outside the place
uh but it's not the breach itself so
it's is this these are different
technologies
yes alex please
you you say that you talk with your guys
and
they told you that this solution is not
very good could you verify more on this
piece
i don't remember all exact technical
stuff that they said
so if you want i just will collect some
feedback from them
for the next call and just explain more
in details uh
what was going on there because they
changed
i think uh three or four frameworks uh
to optimize the work of this atomic swap
solution
so it's it was not an easy game at all
so uh
that's why yeah i discussed with them
please it would be very available yeah
sure sure i will just make a note for
myself
what i uh i mean about bridge with
bitcoin
it's not the same that bridge with
ethereum yes absolutely not
not totally the bridge and yeah
it's more close to atomic swap not
uh the main issue here is that
bitcoin doesn't work like uh like
ethereum
they are absolutely two absolutely
different things in terms of
uh so-called smart contracts there is no
smart contracts in bitcoin there are
scripts
and i'm not a very you know proficient
guy
uh to discuss about scripting in bitcoin
but
i remember something from my tech guys
uh were saying
and uh it's always a nightmare to write
scripts in bitcoin
and i remember that
for atomic swap uh
it's htlc contracts and for the bridge
there should be htlc not contraband hdlc
script
for bridge solution there should should
be
another approach which one i don't know
because we don't have the architecture
and design context we get
so that's why we want to launch it
good idea in this case good idea
thank you welcome
okay so uh i can i can like comment on
yes please all right the problem is like
um the implement it's actually like
um it comes down to the
very simple question how do you
implement like escrow on bitcoin
yeah and uh and there are some research
in this area
like including very recent research
using this new
uh shamir you know signatures
that bitcoin just just implemented
so there are ways to do that i i don't
even know if we need
well we do need a design stage
definitely which
should be based on this research
that research that yes if you can share
it so please
uh everyone not this particular research
i'm saying the
general research of this
problem in bitcoin um because i don't
think we're going to invent anything
absolutely for bitcoin currently so
someone it's a research it's what more
like a researcher work you need to go
and to
find understand what people are writing
analyze that and kind of
you know base your proposal on that
maybe
the only criteria here is that it should
be
uh acknowledged research so uh means
it's not some article on the web written
by someone
without verifying that uh what what is
written there is correct
um but maybe some uh something there is
actually a
paper like which i see now coming 28th
of february 2020
for example on this uh using this new
ecdsa scheme
okay bitcoin so i just i just actually
googled it so
you can use it can you drop a link
please in the description
thank you so much
okay uh so our agenda is over
so if anyone has some other topics to
discuss so
now the time for open questions please
okay sounds good okay in this case i
thank you everyone for attending and i
wish you a brilliant weekend and see you
next
week goodbye bye
yeah goodbye
