guys
let's wait
remove usually
hello everybody
um
all right
let's begin so welcome everyone it's our
38th weekly governance call for the
default group of free tone
so uh we have some updates today so
let's see
there's a bunch of proposals
posted in the group
but
let's begin from from the start actually
so starting from contest
we have two contests that has finished
uh recently so the first one is uh
lending and borrowing contests uh sa so
that was aiming to
describe the discrepancies and the
possibility of implementing the existing
landing protocols on freetown
and we had some some reports there and
generally uh this is only confirmed
in my thoughts and i also
prefer my own analytics uh on what can
be done or not and we will discuss uh
about landing a bit later today
so uh the payment for the lending
borrowing contest will be performed
today this evening so the contract is
already deployed
so we will just collect uh all the
custodians and release the payment
uh it will happen
tonight
uh
next the next contest that has ended is
a self-sovereign identity framework
which is a huge actually the huge in
terms of the quality of the works that
were submitted to this contest but
unfortunately uh it didn't get the
quorum of jurors uh i don't know for
what reason but
uh
now we need to prolong the voting period
uh
to let all those guys put impossible
comments to
to
do this actually and we cannot use it
this is
really a very very good uh contest with
uh
solid participants
uh and
this is the beginning actually for the
ssi framework
um
yeah so uh and uh
link to this so i prepared a bunch of
proposals this morning so the first one
is that
i made the analytics of jurors activity
and talked to some jurors who have been
not really active recently and
of them first of all drug cellulity
he doesn't have time to perform his
journal duties so he decided to resign
and this is the first one uh
also uh
we
will run the additional contest for the
jury selection just to have uh
the number of jurors closer to 20
so if you have some good candidates or
you are not yet a juror and want to
participate so please join but be
prepared that
being a juror is not an easy and easy an
easy task actually and it requires a lot
of your time and uh
although it's very interesting job
because
you
are reading a lot of good
ideas and you are staying on the edge of
the technology and
on the thoughts of the people
but
please
if you don't feel capable to allocate
enough time
and you see that we don't have
contests so frequently but still they
they're normally very big and complex so
uh
please assess your
possibilities
[Music]
just uh be fair to yourself first of all
so if you can or not
um
also uh
uh i posted the long waited uh
ethereum breach stage actually three and
four combined because uh after the
deeper analytics so uh both stages so uh
they cannot be done one without another
and there is no sentence split in them
uh so and uh we will also
run the audit within the
uh within this
contest
of the solution so that uh at the end so
we will get the
uh working solution with the dao
implemented and we have seen already
maybe some pieces of this solution
uh yeah so that's for proposals and also
uh
we had a lot of discussion about
how to calculate jurors votes depend
because
they are not uh actually uh
put the votes uh
for all submissions time to time and
if some submissions got the full uh full
board of votes and others don't so how
would you
calculate every score that directly
affects the price place and for this
purpose uh i added to our procedural
remarks documents the uh possibility to
choose between three calculations
actually so the first one is a default
one uh
where all those count as eligible ones
and
it is used by default and if you don't
specify uh
anything else
uh and this just removes the ambiguity
that
currently exists
the second node is the strict mode uh
when
you uh take the submission with the
least number of rules
uh you take this number and take the
same number of worst
scores in uh other submissions
and then you define the winner so uh it
means that if you
got uh some rejects so these rejects
will seriously affect
uh and uh on the contrary there is a
lose mode uh that uh takes uh
the same number of the best scores
published for your submission and uh
in this mode uh if you get a lot of good
uh
good scores from jurors so this probably
means that you will get the highest
score
uh
all of it it uh
really depends on the context creator so
who will choose which modes or
calculations of course
he prefers
and see
his things is reasonable for this
contest
and this removes the ambiguity
another um
addition that is also linked to the jury
is that after the discussion with some
governance members and the jurors with
the community so um i propose to
increase the
jury rewards first 4.5 to 9
and also add 1 of the prize fund as a
motivation for those jurors who uh
really
really spend their time and assess all
of the submissions so except for abstain
votes of course
so you should really uh
take your time and put some accepts or
reject some submissions with the
valuable comments reasoning why you did
so
and
in such a case you uh are eligible to
share the one percent of the price point
as an educational reward
this is done to motivate jurors uh
really really
performs the duty better
and
uh
right now it is not as the case
unfortunately yeah so we tried to uh put
some rewards we try to notify people but
still still uh people probably don't
feel too motivated to assess all the
submissions some other reasons uh we'll
see how it goes so uh hope this will
help us to increase the judging quality
significantly
uh and
yeah so in the end
i wanted
the jury to be really fair and involved
because we develop quite
uh
the products that are on the edge of the
technology and economics so
it's really necessary
not only from the participant side to
create all this technology and concepts
but also for jurors to
uh select the best the best of the best
yes because in only this case will be
the really uh the most advanced device
system among other blockchains
uh
okay so do you have some questions
for these updates
or we can switch to the lending
discussion raise your hand and say
something
yeah yeah
you have youtube ah
yeah hello
uh
um
about um
if you talk about a prolonged
contest
from ssi i want to clarify
um
this marks what we did for now because i
tried and i bought it for this
it stayed in on the uh feud only time go
up or we need to
one more time to voting
same participants so no no extension of
submission period definitely
uh but at the same time uh
i think it will
will not be fair for those jurors who
have posted already they vote uh to
to restrict them to what
actually because they had fewer time uh
less time to analyze the work then yes
who will just do this
for the extended period so that's why in
the proposal i put that
those jurors who have already posted
their votes they should do this again
and uh
if they want to change something so
they're afraid to do so
in fact they have their advance because
uh some advanced
because they already have read the
documents and they already have some
knowledge but now they will have some
additional time to analyze deeper and
maybe even run a session with
participants but i personally would
prefer to do
but this means that uh
voids uh now go out and
everybody needs to revolt and forward uh
reward uh one more time again yes or no
most probably yes i um personally don't
know if it's possible to transfer uh
because how the voting extension works
actually so uh the interface group that
in fact deploys one additional contract
and transfers all the
data from the old ones to the new one uh
except for the one parameter uh i don't
know if they can transfer only
submissions and without your
yeah votes
it's not so big work in this case
because there are only four submissions
for now it's not maybe so important even
for me for example i did every time
excel file where
puts my opinion on my
quote and after that working it needs to
copy past one more time but uh for me
important to understand to clarify
alexander
do i but but uh what what i want to
check it in in reality so if the the
juries uh already votes and if you're
right that the new smart contract
transfer it submission and previous uh
let's say private marks in previous
previous uh evaluation that that
alexander and me for instance cannot
re-vote it should be rejected let's
check it easy to check
and if uh you you will try to revoke and
repost and it will be accepted so we
will know for the next time that the
in in such cases it's impossible to to
reload uh and it transfer it from the
old contract easy to do it yeah very
useful right
exactly exactly i will check with
interface team or if it's possible to
transfer only submissions without votes
of the current jurors because for jurors
i think it's not a big deal to cast for
votes
through easy vote with just one minute
especially
probably in this case
right and probably that there is a time
to discuss the first first suggestion i
have is to enlarge to the that field of
the the med of the description of the
jurors let's say like in the it was in
twitter history it's 140 40 um
letters in the time to enlarge that
because in most time there is not enough
space to put explanation of it at the
first first question of first suggestion
let's say probably we should speak with
the the the other governances and so on
that the second suggestion is to
trying to
formalize
categories of of
evaluation let's say technical part or
by the groups probably
it will be complicate uh the process and
i'm not sure about it but to discuss
about that so now we have only the the
few few the small fields to to explain
something but some some sometimes it's
not enough
and
uh the the one more things that i spot
for the
chrome extension contest on the ssi in
the decks and so on is
for one submission let's say for
submission a
uh voted
four or six or nine jurors of of of 15
or 16 for the second one in the same
contest it's not the
five or six but nine of it
and what does it mean that's the average
calculation it's completely different
yeah it should be somehow it should be
somehow harmonized and i don't know how
i think about it but i i strongly
believe that that that's the uh
in in some
such cases the average um
evaluation should be completely
different in frame and the one contest
yeah actually uh
to answer you so first uh you can use
easy votes so it already supports i do a
lot larger comments so it's it's not
only it's not limited to
140 symbols or so so you can accept
really a big amount of things
uh the second thing i didn't remember so
uh
what you ask it's about it's about to to
split the um description of china to the
uh
the formal formal class it's it's
actually not possible now uh it's uh
there is a work done in parallel of the
global jury groups uh specializing in in
some specific areas
uh however uh i don't know there's a
problem there and most probably if it
will come
only with the governors to oh
yeah the third one it's actually what i
told in the beginning of the call is
have a look on the new uh procedural
remarks document so it contains already
the calculation
basis remark actually that you can as a
contest create you can select uh so
which mode and how the which scores will
be considered legitimate at the moment
of uh
defining price places
so uh i think it covers almost 100
percent of situations
good but uh will did
this new edition of procedural
procedural remarks will uh regard only
on defy or you will try to spread it on
the whole
uh actually what happens is that defines
that that sense is one of the most
structured
and sound sub governances and uh the the
document that we initially created these
procedural remarks i personally know
it's it's been used at least in two or
three other sub governances uh and
hopefully they will also accept uh the
second version of it so
as a benchmark
and also implement this but uh i can
speak only for the device of governance
anyway anyway let's let's discuss this
this new edition that new version you
you offer it in the later they will
spoke with the kelly on the other side
yeah please
yeah uh hi maybe it is important to know
that
in a sec contest uh the rule about the
reject vote
was not also taken into account you can
check according to some works maybe it
is important to notice for the future
what do you mean
i mean that in procedural remarks we
have the rule that uh when the jury
votes uh reject yeah uh it counts as a
zero yes but as you can see in landing
and borrowing contest uh works which had
uh rejects
they still had average uh
points uh without counting rejected
you mean in the governance interface
yeah yeah don't don't don't don't you
owe it yeah i believe what i believe
that the governor's interface is the
some somehow mistaken calculator yes
don't pay attention to it because uh it
calculates uh the average score in
its own specific manner
and uh this is why a
long time ago i proposed to change the
consensus mechanism specifically for the
device of governance
because
in the governance interface and first of
all it considers
that uh
any proposal is
uh accepted
and unless it is specifically rejected
by jurors and this is not convenient and
it creates a lot of confusion
that's why long ago we changed this to
that every submission is considered
rejected if it's not
approved by the jurors so which is uh
more fair and more
easy to understand also uh
specifically to the device of governance
each of each contest inside uh contains
the
link to the procedural revised for
reason
because uh out there there is a
procedure on how can you calculate uh
the average score of how to calculate
price places
on what is the threshold score and a lot
lot of other information because uh this
is you know like uh
safety measures uh are written by the
blood the same principle pretty much is
for our procedural remarks because we
made some mistakes in the very beginning
it's okay but we're learning our
mistakes and
we try to uh
reflect how we believe the contrast
system uh should work in this procedural
remarks document
and that's that's why i pay attention
that there is a new uh update on to it
uh published on the forum so please
everyone have a look on it if you didn't
read it uh still so it's it's important
to do this now because
uh there are a lot of useful information
inside it and it's it really makes the
voting
and
participation in the contest really
clear and transparent
so average points which are
shown in this interface they are on and
it recounts somehow
yes
actually speaking of landing contests
there are um i can open the table
while the vlad is checking his desktop
lena too
easy votes interface
yep
yeah there is i i strongly believe
that's the the correct calculation in it
not always but you should always
consult the procedure specifically for
the device of governance because
all and easy votes and written stats and
all other interfaces
they are
in fact tailored to be universal so
instead
of incorporate all the specific
needs
some sub government and their
regulations uh in fact there are now two
winners of this contest
following the calculation method
just
this piece here
so uh
with
the first place taking the
two places taking the rewards and these
ones for example they do not pass the
threshold actually because uh rejects
count as zero and they lower the score
and also the the
remainder of the price fund is not used
uh again as for the procedure
and uh
yeah so congrats to winners they will
receive the rewards today
and so for all others just please delete
the procedure
so for now it's made only
manually
unfortunately yes but hopefully
there are already some tools that
facilitate a lot of calculation for
example i personally use the one that
was developed by the
uh
by daniel uh so it is called uh free
throws
because that's the torque
so i will just
uh but still it's a universal one that
[Music]
doesn't allow certain functionality and
you need to every time check it manually
hopefully
one day you will automate all of this
but not for now
okay thank you
okay so um
any other questions guys on these
proposals
so the regarding the zuru exclusion did
you have a chance to spoke with him
personally and yeah yeah absolutely and
he's fine because
he is
really involved in the activity of the
defy lines now and
talks to the other marketplace players
and he simply doesn't have time to
to assess the submissions on contacts
and we agree with him that we will
remove him from the jury
so he is absolutely fine
so and if i'm right that we are still
didn't updated the smart contract about
the nimrod exclusion right
yeah actually uh we
didn't update not the uh only the
sub governance giver so right so his
public key is still there also he cannot
do anything because it has the five of
seven uh
signatures
required to submit the transaction
right but we will redeploy it without
public key
but what i what am i why am i i'm asking
that
uh probably it's the time to do
to do not do twice
that double work uh probably we will
have to say
we'll update it one time with the nimrod
exclusion there was zero exclusion after
the voting no no zura is not excluded
from the membership right
actually actually he's still a member of
the government he performs his duties
custodian as well got it sure for the
for the payment in the the government
absolutely absolutely yeah so he just
haven't have no time to to to judge him
sort of sorted out a lot of
papers yeah
it's a heavy work you know so uh to to
read out of all these papers and to
install them to try to understand how
they work so to ask questions so it's
really time consuming
okay
uh so let's move on so uh
let's discuss the results of the lending
contest uh which is uh
resulted in being quite interesting one
uh and
we
got some insights from it so
uh the major insight is that
it confirmed uh what what i suppose but
but still
most of the
landing protocols that currently exist
in the ethereum are possible to
to transfer
to free tone
there is not so much functionality
inside it that cannot be done
[Music]
directly directly i underline this work
because
anton has proposed as a
way to implement
flash loans
on free tone kind of so i don't know if
he's here probably not so i will ask him
maybe to
come to the next
weekly call and explain more in detail
his concept
but still all this landing mechanics
borrowing mechanics uh roping uh
liquidation uh
and so on so forth all of these are
possible
of course they will require uh some
reworking because first of all we do not
for example have chain link on free time
so we have
our own oracle being developed
at a separate contest as it will be
used by most of the solutions is that
it's of course uh uh needed uh to
pay attention to the asynchronous nature
of free tone and the distributed nature
and specificities that exist in the
blockchain uh but still all of all this
is possible which is a very great news
uh one more finding that i personally
learned uh analyzing all these protocols
is that uh
for example in other there is a very
very good
mathematicians
behind all the processes so they
calculate uh all the risk scores and
they create different
way models to
rebalance
the
portfolio and to
define the
thresholds for different coins uh
which currently doesn't exist in crypto
yeah so
of course we can easily take this
analytics and just copy paste it from
other but without the deep understanding
on why
they selected uh
this or that ratio so uh
it is
not a good way to go
so uh
what i would do actually is first of all
i would run additional contests or to
for building the mass model
for landing uh based on the other
and maybe grounding all the results and
how they can be reduced in future
actually so what i mean is that
uh in case
uh we would like uh or other operators
landing platform would like to add some
additional coins and
how he should score it
because uh of course in other
documentation now it is a state as a
result of
the mathematician boards
but if you need to approach
an absolutely new asset so what is what
would be the procedure and uh
i would uh maybe run the contest that uh
will
help to explain uh all of this stuff and
also propose a model on how to add new
assets to this learning protocol
uh and also speaking of implementation
part um
we can already start approaching the
first implementation phase maybe the
simplest one
uh
i would personally of course target the
market leaders
and mostly uh copy the models of other
compounds and maker
they are not
so much different from each other and
they proved
by the time
that they uh very good ones uh but again
uh
i think that we will discover a lot a
lot of
peculiarities when trying to implement
this in freedom
uh
so
guys who have read the submissions and
all these
ideas that guys have proposed
please
express yourself
what do you think about this
really no ideas
or is it too complex subject to discuss
for now
okay okay
okay in this case i will draft some
contests for mass models for the lending
protocol and
also uh
try to approach the what's what would be
the first stage of this lensing
implementation because
uh definitely the lending protocol is
something really neat here because it's
it's really
a missing piece for some high-level uh
protocols
that may come here
uh later and that we will be promoting
from the fireline sites to
the solutions to the free time
um
okay
i also wanted to
announce and you may have heard already
this on the weekly call but still i want
to
say it again so we have uh two big
uh
wins actually so
we have two uh existing defy projects
with a good liquidity coming to the
freetown ecosystem the first one is crux
so uh for those of you who
may not know so it is a stable coin
packed to us dollar algorithmic so it's
it's a
hybrid stable coin so part of it is
backed by resource and part of it is
algorithmically uh balanced
so it's uh really an interesting project
with its own community
and
this community will be coming here
and
soon we will
also announce about this partnership if
it's already not done i didn't see the
news yet
uh so and uh most probably
it will be
uh also participating in the farming
program so please keep an eye on it and
uh on the harmony and secrets
another one is the stasis
it is a stable coin
packed to euro
and
they will be
coming out trucks
and
this is also a good win because they
have something like 50 or 60
million viewers
in tvl
so uh and this is actually what we
really need uh
right now because we need
some native stable coins and with both
uh products we agreed uh on two stages
of the first stages that they will
simply recently add the support of the
coins to the bridge so they could easily
transfer the native
tokens through the bridge to the
frequency system and at the second stage
so uh we will
they will
build the
the free-to-native version of this table
from not the rocked one but the native
one which is also a great quest to use
and it has a huge huge already
especially in the professional community
so uh good news for all of us and
i hope that it will
boost and boost for its own
future
um
okay so yeah yeah elena please
yeah uh coming back to the topic of
london and borrowing
i just wanted to
mark and know that our
sridev team we took second place in the
contest and
i didn't really have much time to
do essay but we're still grateful for
the opportunity to think about the topic
and we also wanted to
say that if you need any assistance or
help
absolutely
with the draft you can just
message text us and we
thank you thank you of course and i
invite everyone who wants to participate
so
i will just draft the contest and
drop it in the group so if anyone wants
to join the discussion
because
i see different views on how this uh
issue can be tackled and that's great
actually because uh the more concepts we
have the more ideas we have that do not
just simply follow the what already
exists in the market but also try to
uh
to reach some new frontiers and uh
create some new ideas that maybe in
future will be dominated in the market
so the better yeah so uh
uh
i invite everyone to join for discussion
thank you elena
thank you
okay that's pretty from the site uh so
we have some additional topics discussed
so now the time so we have still 20
minutes to discuss
yes yes
um i want to edit some
something about ssi contest i had a
yesterday
conversation with one of from jury
alexey novikov
and
he was totally disagree
alexander he disappeared
maybe it's better i have no bad
connection if not
yeah we hear you know
oh no okay
let's let's try
um
it's about
some
artist bonds in
ssi contest
and where i put a good mark because i
know this team like
famous uh especially one from famous
specialist in ssi femme
and uh i was sure that uh they
understand the stem very good and was a
very good explanation on their white
paper
and
maybe um i
i looked that's very
not so good understanding how free tone
works but
uh i decided that a good team with good
understanding of this term it's much
important that uh
[Music]
okay
maybe i'm explaining in chat maybe it
will be better and we explain
in charts yes
yeah yeah thank you i think what
alexander tried to say that uh
some some jurors so they express
alternative opinions that
in such a contest there should first
come the understanding of how return
works and
only after that uh all other uh
therapeutical concepts behind there all
as a side framework
uh and uh
both concepts uh both attend yes to this
question are true and both of them can
exist and that's good that we have both
of them actually um if you remember uh
in the very beginning when we were
starting the
device of governance uh actually i was
saying and i still stick with this
this idea that
the more diverse the jury is the more
adequate
score
and because
we have a lot of uh people who
understand good finance there's a lot of
people who understand well how friton
works
and all of them have their own opinion
and it's absolutely
good for for all of us if we have
both opinions
here because otherwise it will be just
uh you know um
shifts into only one
part of the problem
and so
i personally like that we have different
abilities
yes i agree with you
thank you
yes
yes but i just wanted to clarify you
said regarding the stables of racks and
stages that
on the second stage they will
make the native implementation
what did you mean by native because in
return we already have tip three which
we
mean as stable
i mean that
they will
create
so right now the infrastructure is uh
tailored specifically to the ethereum
network
so and all of the business processes all
of the uh
smart contracts uh etc etc all of this
is packed to ethereum
when i say that at the second stage they
will uh
create the native the native stable
coins to free tone it's pretty much what
like uh what tesla does so uh initially
if you remember they were on the omni
protocol then they uh added the erc20
version of uh usdt then they added
patron and so on so forth so this is
pretty pretty similar case so they have
the
single custody for the reserves
that uh stay behind the stable coin
but this liquidity uh
will be splitted actually uh between two
networks already so between ethereum and
free tone whereas uh
at the first stage what actually happens
is that they uh
whole liquidity
is backed
that is backed by uh by the reserves
stay in ethereum
even the k is the case that they
transfer the coins through uh through
the bridge doesn't change the fact that
um
the original coin still stays in the
theory
uh the tip three tokens that is issued
by uh by the bridge uh against this uh
locked rc20 version is a stable coin to
stable coin
or derivative
so uh so
the second season will create the level
one talking uh
directly on crypto
okay so they will
make some
mechanisms to directly stabilize uh
using some
uh in intra free-to-own mechanisms yeah
yeah that's why
okay but i don't think that
it is a good stage for the fire alliance
because there were
will be no
no locks so no no locked uh tokens
yes and no uh from one side uh the more
resource the bridge has uh in its
evolves the marines can
earn on it
that's true but on the other side the
more protocols move natively to free
tone the better is the visibility of the
whole project and the more
other projects are coming the ecosystem
so and that's our ultimate uh target
that we have a lot of our native
projects here and
a lot of attention to free tone itself
and not only to serve you know like
operating only with rock tokens
so speaking widely uh in the strategic
standpoint it's better when projects
move natively to future
yeah of course of course
thank you well thanks for questioning
okay any other questions guys please
yeah elena please
yeah i just wanted also to say that uh
tomorrow is the last day of voting
uh protesting
uh yes implementation
yeah thank you so much i forgot
yeah and maybe somebody didn't see in
the chats uh we created short video
presentation about uh everything was
done in our tonsil project during the
second stage so
yeah
if anybody has any questions or comments
we're
open for discussions
thanks thank you elena i will also send
a reminder to all jurors now uh
because uh all of the participant
participants if i'm not wrong have
prepared the demo videos
and you know i'm really grateful for
this because it really facilitates the
judging process
uh
yeah i will think for everyone because
uh i think in fact it's a bit more than
one day uh it's
one day and some some hours still like
