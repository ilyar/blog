oh cinnamon
good
okay
uh hi all uh welcome to our uh ama
session uh this um
this is our guest for today uh it's uh
sergey pategan he is a
team lead at the broxus
and today he will uh tell us more about
the future of products migration
on the new tip
3 standard
closer game please can you
tell us more about it
yeah sure
uh thank you for annotation
um yeah so um in a few words uh next few
days we're gonna have a very
uh
important uh
process called migration
uh basically it's about launching new
token standard in the everscale network
so which is uh also important it affects
probably every existing product on every
scale you know like bridge
dexes uh
wallets block explorers and so on uh so
it's not only about updating the token
uh but also about updating every single
product that works with token
uh
probably will start
tomorrow this whole process
and i hope we will finish it's uh on
tuesday
if everything uh
works fine
so uh basically uh we will update the
bridge uh it means that uh
uh yeah so
few words about the bridge uh
it will be relaunched from the genesis
you know uh so uh every single contract
will be redeployed
uh will have like new token contracts a
new bridge specific contracts and uh so
on
uh which is uh also important we will
publish the instruction for for example
for our release what they uh should do
to
support the immigration
it's not a
complex process you know it's just a few
few comments but uh our bridge release
needs to support it
for a regular user you know like a token
holder everyone who has used the t uh or
like
btc uh
we will publish for your special
interfaces probably on bridge uh maybe
decks maybe some other our websites
and uh your token update will
uh
will be like automatic you know so you
will just detect if you have uh old
version tokens and uh since you have it
we will uh prompt you to confirm the
update all you need is just click button
in your crystal wallet and your old uh
let's say use the t will be burned and
the new one will will be minted to you
that's it you know so for
a like regular user it's kind of kind of
simple process
another important thing is the farming
when we
made a farming like a half year ago
we made it especially uh unupdatable and
upgradable you know so the current
version of the farming let's say can be
stopped immediately okay uh so uh
what we're gonna do we will set the uh
reward speed to zero
so there will be no uh new rewards in
the current farming
let's call it like old farming and uh
after that uh
there is a duration as i remember like
four months or half a year maybe uh into
this uh rewards
you know like your current reward will
be vested to you
so until uh until end of this period
you have to uh you know wait until it
completely unlocked
take it
they they will be released to you in the
old uh tokens you will update it as i
said to the new tokens and
that's it we also will launch the new
farming instance with new pools so
there is no problem for you to
uh right after the update take out your
liquidity from the current farming and
uh deposit it to the new one
uh so so yeah uh the farming also will
be updated it's like first priority
another thing is our decks
uh since you know it works with tokens
it also needs to be updated
uh
probably uh i i hope we will uh also
finish it until tuesday
uh
so
the instruction for the users who have
like uh you know liquidity position uh
in some pools uh will be released
probably it will won't also be a complex
process uh you just need to press a few
buttons probably send a few cheap error
scale transactions and that's it so yeah
uh
well uh what is a
few words about the new token standard
um
first of all why it was uh made
because we had an old token standard for
a year probably and it works just fine
there is there are a few reasons first
of all there are a few like uh
minor security issues
uh they are
uh
they they are not lead to the uh steal
of uh
funds you know you can't lose your funds
but uh they can lead to some kind of
denial of service attacks you know when
uh
some malicious actor can like block you
from performing operations with your
token
and
it's not really good it should be fixed
and the current version of the token are
also
unupgradable
so you know we can't just uh
upgrade all of them uh in uh
in a few in a few minutes
so we have to redeploy all the contracts
all the network all the products
uh another important thing is that uh
the last year
uh in aeroscale we didn't have like the
common token standards like you know the
erc20 in ethereum so every probably
every team had uh
their own standard like processor made
their uh products with their own
standards and labs use their own one and
so on uh we finally uh
found a consensus in our vision of a
token standard
so now uh you can see the the current uh
the current standard on the ever
everscale documentation website it is
already public
basically it will be used across all the
teams across all the products
so it means that uh it would uh
there would be some kind of
interoperability
between products in every scale also you
know every token will be supported by
the
let's say block explorer because for now
it's a kind of complex
process because everyone has its own
token standard and uh
so on so yeah it was like uh
inevitable you know uh process we
had to have uh the common token standard
and finally we reached an agreement
about it i'm really excited
so yeah that's just a
few words about the immigration uh why
we should perform it also it's uh
uh
is you know we have a uh
wrapped tone token in uh everscale
and since we had the rebranding it
should be a name to wrap ether and you
know it's also impossible to
just we can set a new name we have to
update it uh
all over the products we have to create
the new token it will be called wrapped
ever probably
uh so yeah running is another reason
yeah i think that it's more
it's more uh
more community
[Music]
uh waited uh the news that everyone uh
was awaited
and
we we happy to hear that uh there will
be a united uh standard for the
yeah
uh we have collected the um
several questions from our community
um
let me let me
read them uh
what's new in this migration and why do
we need this
um
i think that we already explained it
yeah yeah probably we need a similar uh
standard as a rc20
uh are you going to publish instructions
for this migration
uh yes sure uh we'll publish instruction
for every type of user you know what you
should do if you just have uh
you use the sea on your crystal wallet
there is like one instruction what you
should do if you are really in our uh
bridge relay network it's the second uh
instruction and uh you know what you
should do if you are
standing in unit swap uh version two
wrapped on usdc pool uh it's also
important question and we're sure we
will
publish uh an article about your just
you know step by step instruction
yeah just uh
watch the boxes channels maybe
brock's twitter will publish it to
them
cool cool
uh
is it related for the sort of smart
contracts too
uh
well it
depends on the serve you know uh
so surf for sure uh
can
support this update
and uh it's support for the new tokens
uh
probably i'm not sure because you know
i'm not
a developer
of the surf wallet
uh
what are their exact plan
but uh
tom laps uh also uh participated uh i
think that uh thank them very much uh in
uh the
development of this token standard so
yeah probably in some form it will be
supported in uh the uh surf wallet as i
know uh there is uh you know uh
probability that the
uh exact implementation of the token
wallet
uh will be different between you know
like broxas products and certain labs
products like flex decks and so on
uh the current standard is not about the
exact implementation
but about some core
architecture patterns
some uh core function names and so on so
yeah
you know uh i think that
let's say the
uh
tokens which will be supported in uh
crystal wallet
probably will be supported in surf
wallet too
cool cool
uh the next question is um
can it might be repeated in the near
future uh he mean about the
immigration
operation
yeah yeah yeah that's that's a good
question yeah uh i hope that
we won't need it for a long time
um the new migration uh you know for
example as i said
we
have used the non-upgradable tokens
and the new version is upgradable
so
if anything goes wrong yes there are
also some security uh
bug or something else at least we can
update the
implementation of the token wallets and
uh you know it doesn't affect other pro
products we don't need to redeploy
bridge and so on
and uh
which is also important so we uh made it
uh like um
the current token wallet can be updated
without the
agreement from the owner you know you
you have to uh confirm that okay you're
ready to update your token wallet i
think it's also an amazing feature it's
about decentralizing
and like the uh
community governance of this uh whole
process
thank you for answering uh the next
question is uh
when you farming
as soon as it's possible i hope next
week
next week okay
[Music]
uh so there's uh no more writing in uh
questions uh so let's move on to
the uh
to the
questions from the youtube
um
so
the russian questions uh just
let me translate them okay um the first
question is uh
will integration of uh selectors provide
uh any new possibilities for
for smart contracts uh developers or is
it just something for off-chain
developers
uh
well uh
the internal logic of the smart contract
it's about support them yeah let's say
block explorers you can support any
token which
supports these function ids
so
i'm not sure about the new possibilities
for you know on chain usage and also
there are a few improvements in uh like
uh the boxes implementation of the
tokens for example uh as i remember uh
there was no uh callback on the mint
event
and you know it was tough to integrate
all the means oriented uh
process in your decentralized
application
now it is uh way more easy to do
you can just you know react
every time someone means here a token
and uh
so the the i forgot about this point uh
also like the on chain usage is a little
bit
improved
the function id is maybe it
it don't affect the on chain so much
on next question is uh
are there any plans uh on adding uh
tvm cell parameter for view functions
uh sorry what i mean by cell parameter
i'm not sure
oh let me clarify
uh okay let's move to the next question
uh
so alex is asking uh
so uh now i don't need to unwrap my
errors am i right
uh if you have like uh evers you know
native currency on your crystal wallet
you don't need to do
anything
they are not affected by the immigration
if you have
wrapped tom's token
you
have to update it
to do this you need to unwrap your
reptons receive errors and then grab
them
to the new token correct ever
that's you know like two steps to
upgrade your red stones
uh next question is uh
if i put uh
uh there's regarding soon talking yeah
if i put in some talking farming today
so it's no will be lost and it will be
forming at least for
four five months
uh
i'm not sure about the
exactly like system token with their uh
their plans
but uh yeah basically uh in uh the
current farming
you
your inside entitled reward as i
remember its name uh is uh vested over
this period like four months yeah so you
will receive the final part of your
reward after uh four months
uh what farming speed uh will be on new
platform for uh for example uh
w tone or usd player
uh good question um i'm not sure
uh
i think that uh it will be published in
our uh news channels like you know in a
few days the new information basically
will need uh to finish the
migration and after this uh
the new farming pools will just be
launched
as soon as possible
maybe it will still stay the same i'm
not sure
uh could you provide us uh
this uh the your token uh registry
please
how uh we could add our tokens there
uh let me see the question uh you mean
uh
uh did give me a moment let me send it
to you
okay yeah i see uh if uh
if you mean the token registry like the
white list for tokens
so
this white list is located on the github
and
i think you can make a full request to
it and probably it will be
accepted there are still no you know
like politics about accepting new tokens
in this white list probably we will
upgrade our interfaces
uh to support
uh like
user defined white lists
uh
but uh but you you can try just to make
a pull request
it's uh in their boxes organization this
repo with
a token list
[Music]
uh
it it became a difficult uh practice to
use uh tom wallet plus play out for tip
three operations instead of external
call which calls tip three wallet
directly
via private key
let me see
uh i'm not sure that it's uh
okay i see it became default practice to
use some wallet plus plus payload
instead of external call yes uh right
in our
uh
current implementation it's like the
only way to use the token it's called
like internal call so you you have to
use your basic accounts like uh your
uh
wallet to initialize the call to your
token wallet
so uh
in the in the previous implementation uh
it was implemented but uh as i remember
uh it's uh
never uh never used
at least once um the
whole it is also important to say that
the whole standard the tip three it uh
does not tell you which way of uh
ownership you should use you know
it's like that doesn't care about it so
our token implementation uses the
internal ownership and uh you know
anyone if
if there is a need
can create a new token implementation
with extra external ownership by private
key that's uh that's okay
these tokens still be uh
will be supported
like the
block explorer for example
you will see the token transfers and so
on
uh next question is uh what
are your comments on the standard
interface for default functions like
transfer are not strictly
defined and behavior is not defined
well uh
i can't agree that the behavior is not
defined
uh the
idea about the current standard
is that it implements like you know uh
basic functionality for detecting their
transfers or mint
or burn operations
the
external method
for example for initializing the
transfer can be different uh it
can
depend
on the
uh implementation yeah as as i said for
example you can have two different uh
sub standards like the internal owned
token wallet and external on stock in
the wallet this uh
this uh
method for initializing the transfer
uh
can't be the same you know between these
two standards because uh external
ownership and internal ownership works
uh a little bit
different
uh so uh
the
uh which is also more important here i
forgot to say about it that we will
release the so-called substandard let's
say tip 3.1 or maybe i'm not sure to 3.2
with exactly our current implementation
like the internal ownership the uh
external uh interface for initializing
transfers and mint and burn and so on so
this substandard will define the
behavior as much as possible
and uh
and it will still be compatible with the
general tip 3 standard
uh when uh will the documentation be
published
uh
okay
i'm not sure what
documentation uh is meant
like the
description of their standard tip 3 is
already published on the everscale
documentation website it can be found
on the github also
so
i'm not sure what
i think he meant he meant this yeah i
agree that's he meant this okay
where some custom parameters uh can be
encoded in some logic uh logic like
check users balance and contain original
original context execution may be
implemented
uh
let me read it yeah
i'm not sure that i understand a big
question
right but let me try to guess
the
current uh implementation of the broxas
standards
standard uh supports the
uh like arbitrary payloads
the
callbacks and so on so
you can see for example the
the example on the
uh bridge smart contracts
uh there are like uh this is a specific
payload encoded and passed to a token
transfer and then uh after the transfer
is received
the
like receive callback is initialized so
this way you can integrate tokens in
pretty much any decentralized
application
i hope
i answered the question
yeah
when any guidelines will be available
already answered
um
next question is
uh 214
characters out of 200
there are no
urls i think it's about youtube chat
ah
strange yeah uh will the token
architecture change in the new standard
previously a user created a contract for
each token uh this gives six transaction
per swap and a time
of about
seconds i will use the swap time
decrease
uh
okay yeah great question
i think that
the new implementation
does not
decrease the amount of transactions you
know there is still uh internal
ownership which requires you to send an
additional transaction from your wallet
to the token wallet and uh so on so
probably the new
architecture the new implementation uh
don't uh
don't decrease the swap time for example
i think it's uh on the you know like uh
it requires some uh network uh changes
to
uh m to make this uh
like for example swap time less
on next question uh
the key application of everscale bridges
and decks already work with the
charging standard of
fungible tokens there are no other
applications like flakes flex exchange
then what
will the change of the standard give
developers in the entire scale project
uh also a good question first of all i
i'm not agree that
there are no other complex applications
and another thing that the
like common token standard
uh
allows us
for example to provide a better
onboarding for a new teams
uh it allows uh the
the the more simple development of the
new products you know when there is uh
only one common token standard and there
is no need to research uh
every uh every product available
so uh it's like
uh it's extremely important to have uh
like a common token standard for the
whole network and uh be sure that uh
every product
will be using
it
um
now you can transfer token uh tokens if
uh
everyone's wallet conditionally has one
chord a hash this is a this is a
monopoly on the code
uh
in the new standard uh will the
situation remain the same code for all
cases
uh
well uh if i understand the question
correctly
uh yes
the whole architecture is based on the
simple
simple principle
that uh the token wallets
uh can exchange uh messages only in case
uh they have the same code hash so yeah
basically it's like uh
the main rule of the whole token
architecture
uh how to see uh what the ever tokens
locked in the bridge are invested in
because there are no or achieved not uh
in everscale to make such requests
uh will the new standard help investors
visit
disease okay let me
read it again
uh
well uh
you can always uh check uh
the
uh connected strategies you know and uh
how much tokens are delegated
to every strategy on the uh ethereum
side uh you can just uh you know since
the vault and the strategies are open
source you can just uh verify how many
tokens are invested
in in every connected strategy uh i
don't think that so you need to like are
hypnot and you don't need to make these
checks in every scale
or just use the ethereum side
uh when will tone bridge will be updated
uh as i said uh i hope uh we will end
the update uh
until tuesday so like the
next week yeah i'm sure
next week okay thank you
uh what is your price target forever
bridge for one year from now
can we just skip this question
yeah then
uh there is no financial
advice exactly yeah
uh could you implement automatic on
chain methods to add user are created
tokens to your registry please so
could use their tokens inside brooks's
wallet and send them to dex
to sell them for example
uh it's a good question
let me try to ask
for example
you can remember how
talking lists
work
on the ethereum uh there is like a
standard a so-called token list uh
invented by uniswap long time ago
and uh there are like a lot of uh token
lists uh across the network uh
and uh like the main one uh is uh
controlled by the unis wall it's uh
kinda small you know maybe less than 100
tokens
and it's um it's important to keep it
small uh there is always a risk for
example of uh
phishing let's say you know if i'm
talking about unchain method to add user
created tokens uh what if uh
someone adds like a thousand new usdc uh
tokens you know
uh it's uh
we will have a
huge mess after that so it
this process always
requires some manual checks you know
some security checks
i'm not sure that it
can be done completely automatic
so probably for now uh this process will
remain the same
uh and if you want to add your token
uh
well at least uh you have to create a
pull request
and uh wait until it confirmed
unfortunately i i i just don't know the
other way to do it uh securely
thank you for answering
uh there are three more questions uh it
seems like uh
you're going to update the breach and
token first and only then uh the new
uh
dex decks yeah decks
uh okay uh yeah yeah
i think uh
we haven't started yet but most likely
we'll uh make it this way like uh
the bridge and the tokens
it's like the
basement also for decks so yeah we have
to upgrade them uh at first
uh will there be a redeployment of the
bridge including from the ether side
uh yes yes uh the
uh answer uh is yes because it's
we have uh thought about
uh you know the redeployment without
affecting the current
uh
ethereum and polygon you know and so on
uh
smart contracts and unfortunately it's
uh
impossible in our understanding
so yeah we will also uh upgrade
deploy like new instances for
every single contract that
exists right now
uh how will the bridge functions during
the
this time and what tokens
versions will it support
uh
basically i think uh there would be some
uh
like black uh blackouts you know a few
hours i hope of uh
when the bridge will be disabled
we will also publish the exact uh
information
uh
a little bit later so uh
after that we will try to you know
redeploy the bridge as fast as possible
it's a little a little complex because
uh
it
does not uh
depend on us only
also like a lot of relays
have to update their relay nodes
uh to support the new version of the
bridge until uh
until this uh
intel won't be uh functionable
so uh
i i think that's uh
in a few hours
the the new bridge will be redeployed
and after that like
every every other product will be
migrated
uh the last question is uh the old uh
tip three uh
standard has been audited by proven the
team
uh has a new standard already been
audited
by whom what company who is there who
who is going to make algae yeah
uh
yeah it's an important question
uh for now the new implementation has
been uh reviewed by uh like the boxes
uh
small team of security specialists
and they fixed a few a few few important
issues as i know
uh the
like uh public audit made by let's say
preventer or nil foundation
uh will be
available uh
later
yeah it's it's extremely important i
agree
for now there is now like a public audit
for a new uh token implementation
so uh
there's ah
anton is asking when dexada
uh i'm not sure i think
we should add some more people to this
conversation uh
i'm also interested uh i think at least
uh after the immigration
so
uh
the last question is
what is the owner of the pool
will input all lp tokens in the black
hole
and
he cannot
move the old liquidity to the new
standard what should he do
okay
it's also an important question
the
uh so for now the liquidity provider
tokens are controlled by the decks
itself
and we are aware of a situation like
this when they're
like full creator
have sent
lp's
tokens to the black hole
probably we will update
the old version of the bridge
uh
it's uh
it will update it in order to achieve
the control over the lps
uh after that probably will burn the uh
liquidity provider tokens locked on the
black hole and uh
means uh the same amount
uh to the like pull creator so after
that uh
it will be possible to uh
like withdraw your liquidity
from the old decks uh exchange it to the
new standard and uh put it back uh to
the uh decks
i'm not sure the exact process
uh
but uh
we are aware of this situation and uh we
will also publish some instructions in
our channel
uh
one more question does it matter who
owns the ownership or
or of the root
contract
well uh it depends uh on the
you know like the use cases for your
token
uh
for example you know it's like a good
practice
to uh send the ownership to the black
hole if you don't need it you know let's
say you have a fixed supply token so it
always makes sense uh
it doesn't work for uh every uh
scenario
let's say our tokens uh owned
by the
bridge
so they can be minted each time the
uh
person
uh move
the funds from the ethereum to the error
scale
so
actually yes
it matters it matters and
depends on your use cases
so i think that that was the final
questions there are no more questions
from the community
so uh on this uh note i i suggest to
finish this ma session uh i just want to
say the big thank uh for the sergey that
he came and
uh explain and tell more our community
about the future immigration uh thank
you so much
i appreciate it thank you yeah have a
have a nice
day evening
okay yeah
