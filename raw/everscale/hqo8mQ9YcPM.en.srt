the ram was if we look in decks
there was four stages

180
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
there was four stages
 

181
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,630
there was four stages
and

182
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640

 

183
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,070

it was more or less uh uh

184
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
it was more or less uh uh
 

185
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,429
it was more or less uh uh
possible uh good um separate

186
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
possible uh good um separate
 

187
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,869
possible uh good um separate
these four stages uh and do

188
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
these four stages uh and do
 

189
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,750
these four stages uh and do
uh some smart counter contracts in one

190
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
uh some smart counter contracts in one
 

191
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,470
uh some smart counter contracts in one
stage and the second

192
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
stage and the second
 

193
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,150
stage and the second
and after that did some

194
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,160
and after that did some
 

195
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,389
and after that did some
liquidity mechanism and

196
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:20,399
liquidity mechanism and
 

197
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,990

um in stable coin i tried to do in the

202
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
um in stable coin i tried to do in the
 

203
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,909
um in stable coin i tried to do in the
same way

204
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
same way
 

205
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,430
same way
on the separate on four stages

206
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
on the separate on four stages
 

207
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,270
on the separate on four stages
and but uh it was

208
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
and but uh it was
 

209
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,310
and but uh it was
i didn't know how to do it i talked with

210
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
i didn't know how to do it i talked with
 

211
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,749
i didn't know how to do it i talked with
different

212
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
different
 

213
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,950
different
people about and we don't have uh one

214
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
people about and we don't have uh one
 

215
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,310
people about and we don't have uh one
good opinion how to do it

216
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
good opinion how to do it
 

217
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,950
good opinion how to do it
in different stages

218
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960

 

219
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,150

now i put some

220
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
now i put some
 

221
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,270
now i put some
in group some plus on my message

222
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
in group some plus on my message
 

223
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,710
in group some plus on my message
yes uh where we i

224
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
yes uh where we i
 

225
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,189
yes uh where we i
suggest to think about how to do it

226
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
suggest to think about how to do it
 

227
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,350
suggest to think about how to do it
and if somebody can help and

228
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
and if somebody can help and
 

229
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,390
and if somebody can help and
now maybe we discuss a

230
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
now maybe we discuss a
 

231
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,749
now maybe we discuss a
different opinion how to do

232
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
different opinion how to do
 

233
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,270
different opinion how to do
different stages uh for stable con

234
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
different stages uh for stable con
 

235
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,310
different stages uh for stable con
context

236
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
context
 

237
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,590
context
uh the main problem that uh in stable

238
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
uh the main problem that uh in stable
 

239
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,310
uh the main problem that uh in stable
coin

240
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320

241
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,670

everything so connects to each uh other

242
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
everything so connects to each uh other
 

243
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,070
everything so connects to each uh other
but

244
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
but
 

245
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,270
but
uh for example if we

246
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
uh for example if we
 

247
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,310
uh for example if we
did some stable coil uh

248
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
did some stable coil uh
 

249
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,230
did some stable coil uh
without uh um for example cdp

250
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
without uh um for example cdp
 

251
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,430
without uh um for example cdp
and oracles it's it's nothing

252
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
and oracles it's it's nothing
 

253
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,110
and oracles it's it's nothing
if we do stable coin and some alone or

254
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
if we do stable coin and some alone or
 

255
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,909
if we do stable coin and some alone or
cdp

256
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
cdp
 

257
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,110
cdp
mechanism and without oracles how we can

258
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
mechanism and without oracles how we can
 

259
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,070
mechanism and without oracles how we can
test it

260
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
test it
 

261
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,510
test it
it didn't work for my opinion

262
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
it didn't work for my opinion
 

263
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,590
it didn't work for my opinion
uh and even uh to make oracles

264
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
uh and even uh to make oracles
 

265
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,070
uh and even uh to make oracles
without a stablecoin mechanism

266
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
without a stablecoin mechanism
 

267
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,909
without a stablecoin mechanism
it's mechanine for stabilization um

268
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
it's mechanine for stabilization um
 

269
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,430
it's mechanine for stabilization um
can we test it

270
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
can we test it
 

271
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,710
can we test it
maybe oracle yes but

272
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
maybe oracle yes but
 

273
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,430
maybe oracle yes but
what we do with different than other

274
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
what we do with different than other
 

275
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,629
what we do with different than other
things

276
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
things
 

277
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,029
things
let's discuss if you have who has some

278
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:21,039
let's discuss if you have who has some
 

279
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,230
let's discuss if you have who has some
opinions about it

280
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
opinions about it
 

281
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,909
opinions about it
and maybe somebody can help me

282
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
and maybe somebody can help me
 

283
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,909
and maybe somebody can help me
yes please raise hands

00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
can you hear me no yes no
 

293
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,430
can you hear me no yes no
okay please thank you uh thank you for a

294
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
okay please thank you uh thank you for a
 

295
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,909
okay please thank you uh thank you for a
good informative uh proposal for four

296
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:51,919
good informative uh proposal for four
 

297
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:52,950
good informative uh proposal for four
stages

298
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:52,960
stages
 

299
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,029
stages
but uh my i think about

300
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
but uh my i think about
 

301
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,230
but uh my i think about
some real implementation in which stage

302
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
some real implementation in which stage
 

303
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,270
some real implementation in which stage
uh do everybody see

304
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
uh do everybody see
 

305
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,309
uh do everybody see
the real implementation and launch of

306
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
the real implementation and launch of
 

307
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,950
the real implementation and launch of
that stable coin so somebody can

308
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
that stable coin so somebody can
 

309
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,070
that stable coin so somebody can
try to try to evaluate how stable it

310
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
try to try to evaluate how stable it
 

311
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,710
try to try to evaluate how stable it
could be and how the stabilization works

312
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
could be and how the stabilization works
 

313
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,070
could be and how the stabilization works
in real life

314
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
in real life
 

315
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,830
in real life
maybe we should have the last stage for

316
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
maybe we should have the last stage for
 

317
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,870
maybe we should have the last stage for
a real implementation

318
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
a real implementation
 

319
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,589
a real implementation
when the launch real launch of that

320
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
when the launch real launch of that
 

321
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:29,990
when the launch real launch of that
stable

322
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
stable
 

323
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,790
stable
coin should be what do you think

324
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800

 

325
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,110

uh what do you recommend for example the

326
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
uh what do you recommend for example the
 

327
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,510
uh what do you recommend for example the
first step

328
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
first step
 

329
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,029
first step
uh no i i agree with your stages

330
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
uh no i i agree with your stages
 

331
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,150
uh no i i agree with your stages
yes okay i think that

332
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,160
yes okay i think that
 

333
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,749
yes okay i think that
they this overall task is uh

334
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
they this overall task is uh
 

335
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,029
they this overall task is uh
very complex and it's hard to divide but

336
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
very complex and it's hard to divide but
 

337
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,550
very complex and it's hard to divide but
uh i think it's reasonable to make some

338
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
uh i think it's reasonable to make some
 

339
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,589
uh i think it's reasonable to make some
stages

340
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
stages
 

341
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,950
stages
just like you wrote your proposal i

342
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
just like you wrote your proposal i
 

343
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,510
just like you wrote your proposal i
think

344
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
think
 

345
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,070
think
it's good steps

346
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080

 

347
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,270

um yes okay

348
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
um yes okay
 

349
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,629
um yes okay
for example maslikov

350
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:12,639
for example maslikov
 

351
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,150
for example maslikov
uh recommend yesterday um

352
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
uh recommend yesterday um
 

353
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,749
uh recommend yesterday um
maybe um two stage

354
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
maybe um two stage
 

355
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,070
maybe um two stage
uh there are various set of deck smart

356
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
uh there are various set of deck smart
 

357
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,950
uh there are various set of deck smart
contracts

358
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
contracts
 

359
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,909
contracts
uh where is smart contracts for stable

360
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:25,919
uh where is smart contracts for stable
 

361
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:26,390
uh where is smart contracts for stable
coin

362
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
coin
 

363
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,589
coin
and government governance coins

364
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
and government governance coins
 

365
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,630
and government governance coins
and all mechanisms smart contracts of

366
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
and all mechanisms smart contracts of
 

367
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,430
and all mechanisms smart contracts of
the long

368
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
the long
 

369
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,310
the long
cdp or calculation of index to do it in

370
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,320
cdp or calculation of index to do it in
 

371
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,670
cdp or calculation of index to do it in
one step

372
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
one step
 

373
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,190
one step
it's good idea in case that

374
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
it's good idea in case that
 

375
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,230
it's good idea in case that
it's really possible to test

376
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
it's really possible to test
 

377
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,430
it's really possible to test
together but it's better idea that

378
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
together but it's better idea that
 

379
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,630
together but it's better idea that
i think it's 70 or 80 percent of

380
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
i think it's 70 or 80 percent of
 

381
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,790
i think it's 70 or 80 percent of
all work and we start to discuss

382
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
all work and we start to discuss
 

383
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,070
all work and we start to discuss
maybe uh to do longer uh uh

384
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
maybe uh to do longer uh uh
 

385
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,110
maybe uh to do longer uh uh
stage with maybe three months

386
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,120
stage with maybe three months
 

387
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,030
stage with maybe three months
but um i know i'm not sure

388
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
but um i know i'm not sure
 

389
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,550
but um i know i'm not sure
that it's a good idea

390
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560

 

391
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,750

to do one deep step for

392
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
to do one deep step for
 

393
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,230
to do one deep step for
long time we will wait for example three

394
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
long time we will wait for example three
 

395
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,110
long time we will wait for example three
months and

396
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
months and
 

397
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,310
months and
in the end realize that don't have

398
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
in the end realize that don't have
 

399
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,949
in the end realize that don't have
nothing

400
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
nothing
 

401
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,990
nothing
it's better to do like scrum uh

402
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
it's better to do like scrum uh
 

403
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,350
it's better to do like scrum uh
little steps more or less like scrub

404
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360

 

405
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,070

yet medley please yes i think that

406
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
yet medley please yes i think that
 

407
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,870
yet medley please yes i think that
we should definitely have some

408
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
we should definitely have some
 

409
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,509
we should definitely have some
measurable

410
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
measurable
 

411
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,550
measurable
measurable goals for each stage so we

412
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
measurable goals for each stage so we
 

413
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,190
measurable goals for each stage so we
can

414
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
can
 

415
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,389
can
somehow judge some participants

416
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
somehow judge some participants
 

417
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,509
somehow judge some participants
and understand who

418
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
and understand who
 

419
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,630
and understand who
did the better uh one

420
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
did the better uh one
 

421
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,150
did the better uh one
uh that's the main point and uh the

422
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
uh that's the main point and uh the
 

423
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,509
uh that's the main point and uh the
uh if if we have the large stage

424
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
uh if if we have the large stage
 

425
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,990
uh if if we have the large stage
uh which longs for several months it's

426
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
uh which longs for several months it's
 

427
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,710
uh which longs for several months it's
it uh

428
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
it uh
 

429
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,190
it uh
is a lesser lesser problem than the

430
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,200
is a lesser lesser problem than the
 

431
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,550
is a lesser lesser problem than the
measure measurable

432
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560

433
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,590

some goals for each stage yeah

434
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
some goals for each stage yeah
 

435
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,710
some goals for each stage yeah
great media please yeah i

436
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
great media please yeah i
 

437
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,150
great media please yeah i
i kind of i'm lost because uh

438
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
i kind of i'm lost because uh
 

439
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,190
i kind of i'm lost because uh
how the x contest is related to stable

440
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200
how the x contest is related to stable
 

441
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,230
how the x contest is related to stable
coin contest first um

442
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
coin contest first um
 

443
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,670
coin contest first um
if you look in my message um at first

444
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
if you look in my message um at first
 

445
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,910
if you look in my message um at first
i um show how it was in dex

446
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
i um show how it was in dex
 

447
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,110
i um show how it was in dex
contest only that it was four states and

448
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
contest only that it was four states and
 

449
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,949
contest only that it was four states and
it was uh more or less

450
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:32,959
it was uh more or less

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,990
different steps with different
mechanisms and uh

mechanisms and uh
 

455
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,190
mechanisms and uh
are now about stable coin how we can do

456
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
are now about stable coin how we can do
 

457
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,030
are now about stable coin how we can do
here well unlike example

458
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
here well unlike example
 

459
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,110
here well unlike example
yes understood well the designs of

460
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
yes understood well the designs of
 

461
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,069
yes understood well the designs of
stable coins

462
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
stable coins
 

463
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,470
stable coins
and i'm of course referring to like our

464
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
and i'm of course referring to like our
 

465
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,310
and i'm of course referring to like our
design with andrew for example

466
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
design with andrew for example
 

467
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,230
design with andrew for example
are very different from other designs

468
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
are very different from other designs
 

469
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,509
are very different from other designs
for example

470
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
for example
 

471
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,790
for example
and i'm not sure we can pack it

472
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
and i'm not sure we can pack it
 

473
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,230
and i'm not sure we can pack it
into steps that would be universal for

474
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
into steps that would be universal for
 

475
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,470
into steps that would be universal for
all the designs so if there are several

476
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
all the designs so if there are several
 

477
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,590
all the designs so if there are several
teams that would design

478
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
teams that would design
 

479
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,150
teams that would design
several architectures of stablecoin

480
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
several architectures of stablecoin
 

481
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,949
several architectures of stablecoin
which are completely different

482
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
which are completely different
 

483
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,509
which are completely different
the design steps are not the same and

484
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
the design steps are not the same and
 

485
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,870
the design steps are not the same and
they don't make sense

486
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
they don't make sense
 

487
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,030
they don't make sense
for example for us to start with a smart

488
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
for example for us to start with a smart
 

489
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,470
for example for us to start with a smart
contract what is smart contract for

490
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480
contract what is smart contract for
 

491
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,069
contract what is smart contract for
stable coin

492
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:18,079
stable coin
 

493
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,590
stable coin
in i mean we have a completely different

494
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
in i mean we have a completely different
 

495
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,269
in i mean we have a completely different
kind of situation we have a one uh

496
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279
kind of situation we have a one uh
 

497
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,910
kind of situation we have a one uh
one a set of contracts which are

498
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:27,920
one a set of contracts which are
 

499
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,590
one a set of contracts which are
responsible for collecting

500
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
responsible for collecting
 

501
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,430
responsible for collecting
oracle prices from validators and

502
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
oracle prices from validators and
 

503
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,030

00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
contracts which are the the weekly
 

507
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,150
contracts which are the the weekly
option

508
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160

512
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
stabilization
 

513
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,269
stabilization
and the pool so

514
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:43,279
and the pool so
 

515
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,870
and the pool so
you know like our auction yeah

516
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
you know like our auction yeah
 

517
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,069
you know like our auction yeah
so yeah um i would not know where to

518
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
so yeah um i would not know where to
 

519
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,790
so yeah um i would not know where to
start here

520
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800

 

521
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,310

like what what what applies to this

522
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
like what what what applies to this
 

523
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,509
like what what what applies to this
now okay uh at least i think

524
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
now okay uh at least i think
 

525
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,750
now okay uh at least i think
more or less three separate stage we

526
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
more or less three separate stage we
 

527
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,110
more or less three separate stage we
have first

528
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
have first
 

529
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,389
have first
it's uh some uh type of stabilization

530
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:06,399
it's uh some uh type of stabilization
 

531
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,590
it's uh some uh type of stabilization
with stable coin

532
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
with stable coin
 

533
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,670
with stable coin
second it's oracle and third it's a ux

534
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
second it's oracle and third it's a ux
 

535
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,310
second it's oracle and third it's a ux
do you agree with this or not well

536
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320

 

537
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,030

i don't because in our case you have two

538
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
i don't because in our case you have two
 

539
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,269
i don't because in our case you have two
stabilization mechanisms

540
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
stabilization mechanisms
 

541
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,269
stabilization mechanisms
one a liquidity mechanism

542
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
one a liquidity mechanism
 

543
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,230
one a liquidity mechanism
and then uh interfaces

544
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240

 

545
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,550

and since i believe that the interfaces

546
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
and since i believe that the interfaces
 

547
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,910
and since i believe that the interfaces
and there are different interfaces by

548
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
and there are different interfaces by
 

549
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,190
and there are different interfaces by
the way there is a different interface

550
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
the way there is a different interface
 

551
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,629
the way there is a different interface
for validators

552
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
for validators
 

553
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,230
for validators
there is you know for staking and all

554
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
there is you know for staking and all
 

555
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,750
there is you know for staking and all
that stuff and then there is a different

556
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
that stuff and then there is a different
 

557
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,110
that stuff and then there is a different
interface for

558
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
interface for
 

559
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,710
interface for
um for liquidity pool providers and

560
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:44,720
um for liquidity pool providers and
 

561
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,949
um for liquidity pool providers and
or reserve mechanism i would say and

562
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
or reserve mechanism i would say and
 

563
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,389
or reserve mechanism i would say and
there is a different interface for

564
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
there is a different interface for
 

565
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:48,790
there is a different interface for
auction

566
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
auction
 

567
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,150
auction
and also auctions has a different

568
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,160
and also auctions has a different
 

569
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,470
and also auctions has a different
interfaces one is for large

570
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
interfaces one is for large
 

571
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,509
interfaces one is for large
uh buyers and sellers and another is for

572
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
uh buyers and sellers and another is for
 

573
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,870
uh buyers and sellers and another is for
um you know for retail

574
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:58,880
um you know for retail
 

575
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,949
um you know for retail
so and there is a special contract for

576
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
so and there is a special contract for
 

577
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,870
so and there is a special contract for
retail by the way

578
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
retail by the way
 

579
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,550
retail by the way
so i would not know

580
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:06,560
so i would not know
 

581
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,629
so i would not know
which stage applied to which part of our

582
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
which stage applied to which part of our
 

583
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,550
which stage applied to which part of our
implementation

584
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:10,560
implementation
 

585
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,230
implementation
in this like i would propose to make it

586
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
in this like i would propose to make it
 

587
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,190
in this like i would propose to make it
maybe more i would say general

588
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200

 

589
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,150

or even having it at one stage and just

590
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
or even having it at one stage and just
 

591
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,069
or even having it at one stage and just
saying you know

592
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
saying you know
 

593
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,590
saying you know
just do the implementation of whatever

594
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:25,600
just do the implementation of whatever
 

595
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,269
just do the implementation of whatever
you want you have like three four months

596
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:27,279
you want you have like three four months
 

597
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,910
you want you have like three four months
to do that and that's it

598
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
to do that and that's it
 

599
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,790
to do that and that's it
maybe uh we can somehow define uh the

600
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:32,800
maybe uh we can somehow define uh the
 

601
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,430
maybe uh we can somehow define uh the
scope of

602
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,440
scope of
 

603
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,590
scope of
mvp so what we consider in the pins is

604
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
mvp so what we consider in the pins is
 

605
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,710
mvp so what we consider in the pins is
in this case so

606
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
in this case so
 

607
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,910
in this case so
uh before then for

608
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
uh before then for
 

609
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,069
uh before then for
each yeah i agree that let's say but

610
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:42,079
each yeah i agree that let's say but
 

611
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,509
each yeah i agree that let's say but
it's the same as i said like

612
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
it's the same as i said like
 

613
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,470
it's the same as i said like
let's everyone will create an mvp and

614
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
let's everyone will create an mvp and
 

615
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,750
let's everyone will create an mvp and
mvp means

616
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
mvp means
 

617
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,949
mvp means
you know you cannot you know you're not

618
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:50,959
you know you cannot you know you're not
 

619
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:51,509
you know you cannot you know you're not
going to

620
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
going to
 

621
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,670
going to
expect it to be launched on the mainnet

622
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680
expect it to be launched on the mainnet
 

623
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,550
expect it to be launched on the mainnet
um

624
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,560
um
 

625
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,310
um
but it should provide mechanics and may

626
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
but it should provide mechanics and may
 

627
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,670
but it should provide mechanics and may
may lack some features

628
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:57,680
may lack some features
 

629
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,269
may lack some features
something like that but just very

630
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:00,279
something like that but just very
 

631
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:03,750
something like that but just very
generalized uh description

632
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
generalized uh description
 

633
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,110
generalized uh description
i think because then the mvp in our case

634
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,120
i think because then the mvp in our case
 

635
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,150
i think because then the mvp in our case
would mean very different uh have made

636
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
would mean very different uh have made
 

637
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,509
would mean very different uh have made
very different meanings from meaning

638
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:11,519
very different meanings from meaning
 

639
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:11,990
very different meanings from meaning
from the

640
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
from the
 

641
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,269
from the
mvp of some other implementation i think

642
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
mvp of some other implementation i think
 

643
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,550
mvp of some other implementation i think
but it's a better idea to

644
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:18,560
but it's a better idea to
 

645
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,790
but it's a better idea to
separate stages not by

646
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:21,800
separate stages not by
 

647
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,470
separate stages not by
functionality or by readiness yes

648
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:26,480
functionality or by readiness yes
 

649
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,350
functionality or by readiness yes
maybe it's easy yeah yeah because

650
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:29,360
maybe it's easy yeah yeah because
 

651
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,910
maybe it's easy yeah yeah because
everything

652
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:29,920
everything
 

653
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,470
everything
in general right yes then in general but

654
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
in general right yes then in general but
 

655
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,230
in general right yes then in general but
if you talk about in the

656
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,240
if you talk about in the
 

657
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,389
if you talk about in the
minimum value product it's mean that

658
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:36,399
minimum value product it's mean that
 

659
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,069
minimum value product it's mean that
value we have

660
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:38,079
value we have
 

661
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,509
value we have
at least every team

662
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:41,519
at least every team
 

663
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,550
at least every team
need to give minimal value it's mean

664
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:44,560
need to give minimal value it's mean
 

665
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,670
need to give minimal value it's mean
that

666
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:45,680
that
 

667
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,870
that
you can try you can test this is for

668
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
you can try you can test this is for
 

669
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,069
you can try you can test this is for
example

670
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079

 

671
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,990

in my case for example it's stable coil

672
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
in my case for example it's stable coil
 

673
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,509
in my case for example it's stable coil
that

674
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
that
 

675
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,470
that
without governance mechanism without uh

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
without governance mechanism without uh
 

677
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,069
without governance mechanism without uh
sorry i i don't think that has to do

678
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
sorry i i don't think that has to do
 

679
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,350
sorry i i don't think that has to do
anything with the government because

680
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,360
anything with the government because
 

681
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,710
anything with the government because
governance mechanisms for example in our

682
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
governance mechanisms for example in our
 

683
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,670
governance mechanisms for example in our
case you don't have a governance

684
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,680
case you don't have a governance
 

685
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,629
case you don't have a governance
mechanism

686
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:08,639
mechanism
 

687
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,990
mechanism
it's built into the into the

00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
it's built into the into the
 

689
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,990
it's built into the into the
system and there is no you cannot

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,000
system and there is no you cannot
 

691
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,430
system and there is no you cannot
separate if you

692
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
separate if you
 

693
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,870
separate if you
but um i think what stablecoin need to

694
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:18,880
but um i think what stablecoin need to
 

695
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,910
but um i think what stablecoin need to
prove

696
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
prove
 

697
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,310
prove
on the mvp stage is actually the

698
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
on the mvp stage is actually the
 

699
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,189
on the mvp stage is actually the
stability

700
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:25,199

 

701
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,110

so we need to be able to um

702
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,120
so we need to be able to um
 

703
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,749
so we need to be able to um
to actually kind of test the stability

704
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:31,759
to actually kind of test the stability
 

705
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,629
to actually kind of test the stability
by

706
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
by
 

707
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,670
by
inflicting a price rapid price changes

708
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
inflicting a price rapid price changes
 

709
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,829
inflicting a price rapid price changes
downwards particularly and that should

710
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:39,839
downwards particularly and that should
 

711
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,670
downwards particularly and that should
be the test case scenario

712
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:41,680
be the test case scenario
 

713
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,870
be the test case scenario
but how you can do that without if if

714
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:44,880
but how you can do that without if if
 

715
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,430
but how you can do that without if if
there is a mechanism based on value

716
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
there is a mechanism based on value
 

717
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,069
there is a mechanism based on value
like based on some perception of the

718
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
like based on some perception of the
 

719
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,509
like based on some perception of the
price

720
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
price
 

721
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,949

then you cannot test it simply speaking

722
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:54,959
then you cannot test it simply speaking
 

723
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,710
then you cannot test it simply speaking
you just won't be able to test it

724
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720
you just won't be able to test it
 

725
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,629
you just won't be able to test it
because the game mechanics will not

726
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:58,639
because the game mechanics will not
 

727
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,110
because the game mechanics will not
be it cannot be simulated without money

728
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,120
be it cannot be simulated without money

yes we can we can emulate the prices yes

740
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:16,959
yes we can we can emulate the prices yes
 

741
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,550
yes we can we can emulate the prices yes
and relate to prices and uh

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560
and relate to prices and uh
 

743
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,550

but but but it won't what i'm saying is

744
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:22,560
but but but it won't what i'm saying is
 

745
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,470
but but but it won't what i'm saying is
that it won't prove anything

746
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
that it won't prove anything
 

747
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,389
that it won't prove anything
and the most important part in any

00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:26,399
and the most important part in any
 

749
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,710

stable coin isn't stability
so on on the we're doing the mvp level

752
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
so on on the we're doing the mvp level
 

753
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,069
so on on the we're doing the mvp level
but it's

754
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:32,079
but it's
 

755
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,269
but it's
really just an mvp of the i would say

756
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
really just an mvp of the i would say
 

757
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,030
really just an mvp of the i would say

00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
interfaces blah blah blah but
 

761
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,189

we can we won't be able to test actually

762
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:41,199
we can we won't be able to test actually
 

763
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,470
we can we won't be able to test actually
how this coin

764
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
how this coin
 

765
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,910
how this coin
is going to really uh behave

766
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
is going to really uh behave
 

767
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,710
is going to really uh behave
on in the real economic scenario

768
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:50,720
on in the real economic scenario
 

769
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,110
on in the real economic scenario
right so we are not we're not going to

770
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,120
right so we are not we're not going to
 

771
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,590
right so we are not we're not going to
be how we are going to

772
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600
be how we are going to
 

773
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,509
be how we are going to
kind of what what the um

774
00:16:59,509 --> 00:16:59,519
kind of what what the um
 

775
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,270
kind of what what the um
what the judgments like uh

776
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,280
what the judgments like uh
 

777
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,230
what the judgments like uh
measurement should be okay guys i see

778
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240
measurement should be okay guys i see
 

779
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,470
measurement should be okay guys i see
that we have somehow stalked a bit here

780
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
that we have somehow stalked a bit here
 

781
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:10,789
that we have somehow stalked a bit here
and

782
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
and
 

783
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,230
and
so we have one more hand raised uh

784
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240
so we have one more hand raised uh
 

785
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,829
so we have one more hand raised uh
let's listen to ivan

786
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:17,839
let's listen to ivan
 

787
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,750
let's listen to ivan
maybe he has some good ideas i just

788
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
maybe he has some good ideas i just
 

789
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,829
maybe he has some good ideas i just
wanted to ask a question because like

790
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839
wanted to ask a question because like
 

791
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,710
wanted to ask a question because like
i'm not

792
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
i'm not
 

793
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,309
i'm not
really uh expert so so the

794
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:26,319
really uh expert so so the
 

795
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,909
really uh expert so so the
the the question is uh why do we need ux

796
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:29,919
the the question is uh why do we need ux
 

797
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,789
the the question is uh why do we need ux
for stable coin contest like why are we

798
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
for stable coin contest like why are we
 

799
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,750
for stable coin contest like why are we
even mentioned

800
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
even mentioned
 

801
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,590
even mentioned
ux stage like because the does usdt have

802
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:37,600
ux stage like because the does usdt have
 

803
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,669
ux stage like because the does usdt have
ux does die yes yeah it has

804
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679
ux does die yes yeah it has
 

805
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,390
ux does die yes yeah it has
well it's a product like it's a product

809
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,029
but
we don't speak a product we speaking

will not work like stable coin mechanism

832
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:18,559

00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,160

 

863
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,789

like i just wanted to my opinion is like

864
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:06,799
like i just wanted to my opinion is like
 

865
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,270
like i just wanted to my opinion is like
if if

866
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
if if
 

867
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,190
if if
smart system works then you don't need

868
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
smart system works then you don't need
 

869
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,390
smart system works then you don't need
ux to to some to proof or to like

870
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,400
ux to to some to proof or to like
 

871
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,590
ux to to some to proof or to like
you don't need ux contest to say to say

872
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:17,600
you don't need ux contest to say to say
 

873
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:17,909
you don't need ux contest to say to say
that

874
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:17,919
that
 

875
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,870
that
okay we are ready

876
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:22,880

 

877
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,830

yes it is just my opinion yeah i'm

878
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:25,840
yes it is just my opinion yeah i'm
 

879
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,990
yes it is just my opinion yeah i'm
finished

880
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,000
finished
 

881
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,470
finished
i think at this point we don't know

882
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
i think at this point we don't know
 

883
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,190
i think at this point we don't know
maybe

884
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,200
maybe
 

885
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,190
maybe
tbot interface will be enough but

886
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,200
tbot interface will be enough but
 

887
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,630
tbot interface will be enough but
because we don't have a working

888
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
because we don't have a working
 

889
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,510
because we don't have a working
implementation of debot interface

890
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,520
implementation of debot interface
 

891
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,750
implementation of debot interface
i mean we do but we don't have that many

892
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
i mean we do but we don't have that many
 

893
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,710
i mean we do but we don't have that many
examples

894
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:40,720
examples
 

895
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,909
examples
uh which can use it in production ready

896
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:43,919
uh which can use it in production ready
 

897
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,110
uh which can use it in production ready
system then why

898
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120
system then why
 

899
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,950
system then why
that's why we are kind of hedging this

900
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:46,960
that's why we are kind of hedging this
 

901
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,870
that's why we are kind of hedging this
risk and

902
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:48,880
risk and
 

903
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,750
risk and
we we don't know yet maybe we won't need

904
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
we we don't know yet maybe we won't need
 

905
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,549
we we don't know yet maybe we won't need
this ui

906
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:52,559
this ui
 

907
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,750
this ui
use interface stage maybe we will

908
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:55,760
use interface stage maybe we will
 

909
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,470
use interface stage maybe we will
but we decided to put it in the context

910
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,480
but we decided to put it in the context
 

911
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,270

okay uh so what's

940
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:30,960
okay uh so what's
 

941
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,990
okay uh so what's
what's the solution so we need

942
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
what's the solution so we need
 

943
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,510
what's the solution so we need
to agree on the next steps then so we

944
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:37,520
to agree on the next steps then so we
 

945
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,510
to agree on the next steps then so we
should we make some kind of first meteor

946
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:39,520
should we make some kind of first meteor

opinion maybe we make
 

961
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,230
opinion maybe we make
maybe not four maybe three stage and

962
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
maybe not four maybe three stage and
 

963
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,029
maybe not four maybe three stage and
start from

what i propose is uh let's let's maybe
 

981
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,590
what i propose is uh let's let's maybe
finalize some kind of

982

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,190
and we need to move on with it
yeah but one more meter um you said that

996
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,200
yeah but one more meter um you said that
 

997
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,350
yeah but one more meter um you said that
the no the main things in stabilization

998

1000
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:56,960
but uh maybe not all submission
 

1001
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,669
but uh maybe not all submission
um use special mechanism for

1002
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
um use special mechanism for
 

1003
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,870
um use special mechanism for
stabilization

1004
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:00,880
stabilization
 

1005
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,750
stabilization
for example some stable coils

1006
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:07,760

 

1007
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,430

need for stabilization market makers and

1008
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:11,440
need for stabilization market makers and
 

1009
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,510
need for stabilization market makers and
not automatic market makers

1010
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:13,520
not automatic market makers
 

1011
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,789
not automatic market makers
i read some of uh submission and the

1012
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:16,799
i read some of uh submission and the
 

1013
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,270
i read some of uh submission and the
remaining

1014
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,280
remaining
 

1015
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,510
remaining
mechanism it's still a mechanism my

1016
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:19,520
mechanism it's still a mechanism my
 

1017
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,549
mechanism it's still a mechanism my
point is um

1018
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:20,559
point is um
 

1019
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,070
point is um
yes you mean that even your mechanism

1020
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,080
yes you mean that even your mechanism
 

1021
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,350
yes you mean that even your mechanism
for stabilization you need uh

1022
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,360
for stabilization you need uh
 

1023
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,710
for stabilization you need uh
used market makers even not automatic

1024
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:30,720
used market makers even not automatic
 

1025
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,990
used market makers even not automatic
you need to give this mechanism for

1026
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,000
you need to give this mechanism for
 

1027
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,230
you need to give this mechanism for
market making and not only that you need

1028
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,240
market making and not only that you need
 

1029
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,270
market making and not only that you need
also to provide

1030
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:37,280
also to provide
 

1031
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,549
also to provide
the risk they doesn't matter who

1032
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:40,559
the risk they doesn't matter who
 

1033
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,350
the risk they doesn't matter who

the the that this that the stable coin

1038
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,280
the the that this that the stable coin
 

1039
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,870
the the that this that the stable coin
works for example

1040
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:48,880
works for example
 

1041
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,990
works for example
like even in the usd scenario

1042
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,000
like even in the usd scenario
 

1043
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,830
like even in the usd scenario
well if usdt if suddenly we tomorrow

1044
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
well if usdt if suddenly we tomorrow

yes so yeah so without the actual risk

1062
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:15,039
yes so yeah so without the actual risk
 

1063
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,350
yes so yeah so without the actual risk
kind of uh factor in this game mechanic

you will not be able to uh

1066
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:22,400
you will not be able to uh
 

1067
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,310
you will not be able to uh
judge if the stable coin works or not

1068
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
judge if the stable coin works or not
 

1069
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,870
judge if the stable coin works or not
yes but in case with usdt i think they

1070
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:28,880
yes but in case with usdt i think they
 

1071
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,710
yes but in case with usdt i think they
didn't have special mechanism in this

1072
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:30,720
didn't have special mechanism in this
 

1073
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,190
didn't have special mechanism in this
case

1074
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,200
case
 

1075
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,750
case
this is the mechanism the fact that they

1076
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:33,760
this is the mechanism the fact that they
 

1077
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,549
this is the mechanism the fact that they
collectorize

1078
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:34,559

account is the stabilization mechanism

1082
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:38,720
account is the stabilization mechanism
 

1083
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,029
account is the stabilization mechanism
and everyone else on the market believes

1084
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
and everyone else on the market believes
 

1085
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,149
and everyone else on the market believes
that they really

1086
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:42,159
that they really
 

1087
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,750
that they really
have at least some of these dollars

1088
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:45,760
have at least some of these dollars
 

1089
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,950
have at least some of these dollars
backing of the the usdt because if the

1090
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:48,960
backing of the the usdt because if the
 

1091
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,630
backing of the the usdt because if the
market would not believe so

1092
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:50,640
market would not believe so
 

1093
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,630
market would not believe so
the price of the usdt would be zero

1094
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
the price of the usdt would be zero
 

1095
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,990
the price of the usdt would be zero
but uh if for example they have uh

1096
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,000
but uh if for example they have uh
 

1097
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,510
but uh if for example they have uh
80 percent of characterization on 70 it

1098
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
80 percent of characterization on 70 it
 

1099
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,430
80 percent of characterization on 70 it
doesn't mean that if yes it means

1100
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,440
doesn't mean that if yes it means
 

1101
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,269
doesn't mean that if yes it means
yes it does meaning that uh right now

1102
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:09,279
yes it does meaning that uh right now
 

1103
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,310
yes it does meaning that uh right now
that's why a lot of out money went out

1104
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,320
that's why a lot of out money went out
 

1105
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,990
that's why a lot of out money went out
of usdt

1106
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
of usdt
 

1107
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,870
of usdt
rapidly when they were like the the

1108
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:16,880
rapidly when they were like the the
 

1109
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,590
rapidly when they were like the the
audit

1110
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,600
audit
 

1111
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,909
audit
uh which which you know all this story

1112
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:19,919
uh which which you know all this story
 

1113
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,510
uh which which you know all this story
so basically it affects

1114
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:21,520
so basically it affects
 

1115
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,310
so basically it affects
the liquidity of the and after reaching

1116
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,320
the liquidity of the and after reaching
 

1117
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,549
the liquidity of the and after reaching
certain point in liquidity

1118
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:26,559
certain point in liquidity
 

1119
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,669
certain point in liquidity
um there the you would see the collapse

1120
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:29,679
um there the you would see the collapse
 

1121
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,630
um there the you would see the collapse
of the price of

1122
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:30,640
of the price of
 

1123
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,789
of the price of
usdt and therefore that's why they

1124
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:32,799
usdt and therefore that's why they
 

1125
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,950
usdt and therefore that's why they
actually agreed in the end to this audit

1126
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:34,960
actually agreed in the end to this audit
 

1127
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,669
actually agreed in the end to this audit
so they do have some usd some dollars

1128
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:37,679
so they do have some usd some dollars
 

1129
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:38,789
so they do have some usd some dollars
making that

1130
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:38,799
making that
 

1131
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,350
making that
up in the bank account otherwise you

1132
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:41,360
up in the bank account otherwise you
 

1133
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,269
up in the bank account otherwise you
know otherwise we would see the

1134
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:43,279
know otherwise we would see the
 

1135
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,710
know otherwise we would see the
the the the price collapse so what i my

1136
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:46,720
the the the price collapse so what i my
 

1137
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,630
the the the price collapse so what i my
point is that on any stable coin

1138
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:48,640
point is that on any stable coin
 

1139
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,710
point is that on any stable coin

you still need a real value behind this

1148
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:00,720
you still need a real value behind this

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,070
you still need a real value behind this

to test if this if the coin is stable

1152
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:04,559
to test if this if the coin is stable
 

1153
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,070
to test if this if the coin is stable
because for example

1154
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,080
because for example
 

1155
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,310
because for example
if tomorrow some guy who is known crook

1156
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,320
if tomorrow some guy who is known crook
 

1157
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,750

will uh issue a stable coin and will say

1160
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:16,559
will uh issue a stable coin and will say
 

1161
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,630
will uh issue a stable coin and will say
i back this stable coin with dollars in

1162
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:18,640
i back this stable coin with dollars in
 

1163
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,630
i back this stable coin with dollars in
my account i don't think this

1164
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:20,640
my account i don't think this
 

1165
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,430
my account i don't think this
uh this stable coin will you know have

1166
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:23,440
uh this stable coin will you know have
 

1167
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,990
uh this stable coin will you know have
any value

1168
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,000
any value
 

1169
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,950
any value
so it's also it's also depends not only

1170
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:28,960
so it's also it's also depends not only
 

1171
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,070
so it's also it's also depends not only
in some points

1172
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,080
in some points
 

1173
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,149
in some points
not only depends on the algorithms it

1174
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
not only depends on the algorithms it
 

1175
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,830
not only depends on the algorithms it
can depend also on the

1176
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:33,840
can depend also on the
 

1177
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,310
can depend also on the
like for example someone's um reputation

1178
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,320
like for example someone's um reputation
 

1179
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,990
like for example someone's um reputation
but it's still a market and gay

come to an end
 

1217
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,310
come to an end
and we are ready to present you the

1218
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:36,320
and we are ready to present you the
 

1219
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,029
and we are ready to present you the
transfer

1220
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039
transfer
 

1221
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,909
transfer
of tokens between the two blockchains

1222
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:39,919
of tokens between the two blockchains
 

1223
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,750
of tokens between the two blockchains
which is a

1224
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:41,760
which is a
 

1225
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,269
which is a
substrate based chain and uh

1226
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:45,279
substrate based chain and uh
 

1227
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,710
substrate based chain and uh
free tone chain uh it was very very hot

1228
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
free tone chain uh it was very very hot
 

1229
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,390
free tone chain uh it was very very hot
in developing past few weeks

1230
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:50,400
in developing past few weeks
 

1231
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,110
in developing past few weeks
we just finished and we will start the

1232
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,120
we just finished and we will start the
 

1233
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,029
we just finished and we will start the
demonstration now

1234
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:55,039
demonstration now
 

1235
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,470
demonstration now
as usual we are starting the two nodes

1236
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:58,480
as usual we are starting the two nodes
 

1237
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,750
as usual we are starting the two nodes
on the screen as you can see

1238
00:26:59,750 --> 00:26:59,760
on the screen as you can see
 

1239
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,149
on the screen as you can see
one is a free turn node and another is a

1240
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:02,159
one is a free turn node and another is a
 

1241
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,070
one is a free turn node and another is a
substrate base node

1242
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,080
substrate base node
 

1243
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,750
substrate base node
okay it's ready

1244
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:07,760
okay it's ready
 

1245
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,950
okay it's ready
setup sense let's start the setup

1246
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:12,960
setup sense let's start the setup
 

1247
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,110
setup sense let's start the setup
okay this setup sends the initial value

1248
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,120
okay this setup sends the initial value
 

1249
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,190
okay this setup sends the initial value
to contracts and deploy them

1250
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,200
to contracts and deploy them
 

1251
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,389
to contracts and deploy them
to a local tone node also set up

1252
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:22,399
to a local tone node also set up
 

1253
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,430
to a local tone node also set up
a substrate node for interacting with

1254
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,440
a substrate node for interacting with
 

1255
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,110
a substrate node for interacting with
doton protocol

1256
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,120
doton protocol
 

1257
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,789
doton protocol
now we are waiting for containers to

1258
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:30,799
now we are waiting for containers to
 

1259
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,950
now we are waiting for containers to
finish the setup

1260
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:32,960
finish the setup
 

1261
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,190
finish the setup
it may take some time but it will happen

1262
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:37,200
it may take some time but it will happen
 

1263
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,029
it may take some time but it will happen
let's wait for this

1264
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:43,039

 

1265
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,230

okay while this happening uh we we

1266
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:46,240
okay while this happening uh we we
 

1267
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,990
okay while this happening uh we we
finish only the second stage out

1268
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,000
finish only the second stage out
 

1269
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,789
finish only the second stage out
of four which means we are ready to

1270
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:50,799
of four which means we are ready to
 

1271
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,669
of four which means we are ready to
transfer the tokens themselves but we

1272
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:53,679
transfer the tokens themselves but we
 

1273
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,710
transfer the tokens themselves but we
still have so much to do in upfront of

1274
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:56,720
still have so much to do in upfront of
 

1275
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,350
still have so much to do in upfront of
us

1276
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:57,360
us
 

1277
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,830
us
like the economics part of it and etc

1278
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:00,840
like the economics part of it and etc
 

1279
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,149
like the economics part of it and etc
etc

1280
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:02,159
etc
 

1281
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,870
etc
okay let's see how it's going

1282
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:06,880

 

1283
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:14,230

please bear with us it will happen

1284
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:14,240

 

1285
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,350

okay it's uh it's done now

1286
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:17,360
okay it's uh it's done now
 

1287
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,830
okay it's uh it's done now
so we are starting the relay node or

1288
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:19,840
so we are starting the relay node or
 

1289
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:26,549
so we are starting the relay node or
bridge node itself

1290
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:26,559

 

1291
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,590

okay it's all started well okay we will

1292
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:29,600
okay it's all started well okay we will
 

1293
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,269
okay it's all started well okay we will
start transfer the first transfer will

1294
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:33,279
start transfer the first transfer will
 

1295
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,430
start transfer the first transfer will
be from substrate base node

1296
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:35,440
be from substrate base node
 

1297
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,549
be from substrate base node
to a free tone node and to do this we

1298
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:38,559
to a free tone node and to do this we
 

1299
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,830
to a free tone node and to do this we
set the balance

1300
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:41,840
set the balance
 

1301
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,549
set the balance
to account with a name of ton recipient

1302
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:46,559
to account with a name of ton recipient
 

1303
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,990
to account with a name of ton recipient
yep okay this one uh it is zero now as

1304
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,000
yep okay this one uh it is zero now as
 

1305
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,269
yep okay this one uh it is zero now as
you can see

1306
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:51,279
you can see
 

1307
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,310
you can see
and we will top it up by

1308
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:54,320
and we will top it up by
 

1309
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,110
and we will top it up by
10 000 for example as an example

1310
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,120
10 000 for example as an example
 

1311
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,190
10 000 for example as an example
this is needed because we are in the

1312
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,200
this is needed because we are in the
 

1313
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,710
this is needed because we are in the
development mode right now

1314
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:04,720

 

1315
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,990

okay uh as we can see the balance has

1316
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,000
okay uh as we can see the balance has
 

1317
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,190
okay uh as we can see the balance has
has it changed

1318
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,200

 

1319
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,240

yeah okay we got the 10 000

1320
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,250
yeah okay we got the 10 000
 

1321
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,669
yeah okay we got the 10 000
[Music]

1322

[Music]
 

1323
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,950
[Music]
okay we are initiating the transfer of

1324
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:18,960
okay we are initiating the transfer of
 

1325
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,789
okay we are initiating the transfer of
tokens from substrate account

1326
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:20,799
tokens from substrate account
 

1327
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,830
tokens from substrate account
to well okay let's see the address

1328
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:23,840
to well okay let's see the address
 

1329
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,190
to well okay let's see the address
to which uh we will top up the balance

1330
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,200

 

1331
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,590

okay we see the pre-deployed wallet in a

1332
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:31,600
okay we see the pre-deployed wallet in a
 

1333
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,510
okay we see the pre-deployed wallet in a
free tone network

1334
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:33,520
free tone network
 

1335
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,990
free tone network
as you can see the balance is zero right

1336
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,000
as you can see the balance is zero right
 

1337
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,549
as you can see the balance is zero right
now

1338
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:36,559
now
 

1339
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,230
now
and the address we're copying the

1340
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:38,240
and the address we're copying the
 

1341
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,269
and the address we're copying the
address to which we will

1342
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:41,279
address to which we will
 

1343
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,710
address to which we will
send the money

1344
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:46,720

 

1345
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,389

one second okay we will send 1000

1346
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:50,399
one second okay we will send 1000
 

1347
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,510
one second okay we will send 1000
as an example and let's sign the

1348
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:53,520
as an example and let's sign the
 

1349
00:29:53,520 --> 00:30:00,950
as an example and let's sign the
transaction

1350
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:00,960

 

1351
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,510

okay signing is successful now we check

1352
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:05,520
okay signing is successful now we check
 

1353
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,230
okay signing is successful now we check
in the relay node log to see when the

1354
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,240
in the relay node log to see when the
 

1355
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,230
in the relay node log to see when the
relay node will show us

1356
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,240
relay node will show us
 

1357
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,510
relay node will show us
that it is got the event

1358
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:13,520
that it is got the event
 

1359
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,750
that it is got the event
once again it may take some time for the

1360
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:15,760
once again it may take some time for the
 

1361
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,269
once again it may take some time for the
blockchain to

1362
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,279
blockchain to
 

1363
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,470
blockchain to
process this information

1364
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:20,480
process this information
 

1365
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,710
process this information
okay the relay node is attempting to

1366
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:22,720
okay the relay node is attempting to
 

1367
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,510
okay the relay node is attempting to
send a proposal about the token transfer

1368
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:25,520
send a proposal about the token transfer
 

1369
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,590
send a proposal about the token transfer
it approves itself because at this stage

1370
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:27,600
it approves itself because at this stage
 

1371
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,630
it approves itself because at this stage
we have uh

1372
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:28,640
we have uh
 

1373
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,149
we have uh
only one relayer

1374
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:32,159

 

1375
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,310

1383
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,430

i think we copied the wrong address

1384
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:47,440
i think we copied the wrong address
 

1385
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:55,510
i think we copied the wrong address
let's try again okay so why

1386
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:55,520

 

1387
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:02,389

1389
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,230

okay we will try to send one more time

1390
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:04,240
okay we will try to send one more time
 

1391
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,669
okay we will try to send one more time
because the address we copied was wrong

1392
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:07,679
because the address we copied was wrong
 

1393
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,269
because the address we copied was wrong
just a typo nothing to worry about okay

1394
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:11,279
just a typo nothing to worry about okay
 

1395
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,269
just a typo nothing to worry about okay
and we are waiting in relay node again

1396
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:13,279
and we are waiting in relay node again
 

1397
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,710
and we are waiting in relay node again
the message

1398

1407
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,310

and because we have only one relayer we

1408
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:34,320
and because we have only one relayer we
 

1409
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,950
and because we have only one relayer we
sign it signed itself that transaction

1410
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:36,960
sign it signed itself that transaction
 

1411
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,830
sign it signed itself that transaction
now let's

1412
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:37,840
now let's
 

1413
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:45,269
now let's
check our balance on the free tone side

1414
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:45,279

 

1415
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,710

we're just making sure that every every
 

1543
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,470
we're just making sure that every every
letter is correct with sorry

1544
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:44,480
letter is correct with sorry
 

1545
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,670
letter is correct with sorry
signing the transaction and

1546
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:47,680
signing the transaction and
 

1547
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,310
signing the transaction and
submit

1548
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:52,320

 

1549
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,270

okay the balance has some money has gone

1550
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:55,280
okay the balance has some money has gone
 

1551
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,870
okay the balance has some money has gone
away which is a thousand and now we

1552
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:56,880
away which is a thousand and now we
 

1553
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,670
away which is a thousand and now we
we're waiting for that money

1554
00:35:59,670 --> 00:35:59,680
we're waiting for that money
 

1555
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:05,910
we're waiting for that money
in in another blockchain

1556
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:05,920

 

1557
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,910

now we are we are still in a relay node

1558
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:07,920
now we are we are still in a relay node
 

1559
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,030
now we are we are still in a relay node
waiting for the

1560
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,040
waiting for the
 

1561
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,030
waiting for the
event to happen okay okay now it's

1562
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,040
event to happen okay okay now it's
 

1563
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,470
event to happen okay okay now it's
gone well let's check the balance on uh

1564
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:16,480
gone well let's check the balance on uh
 

1565
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,510
gone well let's check the balance on uh
uh yeah on the free tone side

1566
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:19,520
uh yeah on the free tone side
 

1567
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,030
uh yeah on the free tone side
see if it has happened it was zero

1568
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,040
see if it has happened it was zero
 

1569
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,230
see if it has happened it was zero
let's check the balance okay finally

1570
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:26,240
let's check the balance okay finally
 

1571
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,230
let's check the balance okay finally
we go a thousand tokens dtn

1572
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:30,240
we go a thousand tokens dtn
 

1573
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,030
we go a thousand tokens dtn
on the balance which is a perfect result

1574
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,040
on the balance which is a perfect result
 

1575
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,790
on the balance which is a perfect result
okay all done uh

1576
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:38,800
okay all done uh
 

1577
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,190
okay all done uh
now let's see how the transfer tokens

1578
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:41,200
now let's see how the transfer tokens
 

1579
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,349
now let's see how the transfer tokens
the opposite way when we try to send

1580
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:43,359
the opposite way when we try to send
 

1581
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,390
the opposite way when we try to send
money for

1582
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:44,400
money for
 

1583
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,349
money for
try to set tokens i'm sorry in a console

1584
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:47,359
try to set tokens i'm sorry in a console
 

1585
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:47,910
try to set tokens i'm sorry in a console
sending

1586
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:47,920
sending
 

1587
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,910
sending
let's say 100 yes

1588
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:51,920

 

1589
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,510

100 ton to our substrate

1590
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:55,520
100 ton to our substrate
 

1591
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,990
100 ton to our substrate
we are sending yep

1592
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,000
we are sending yep
 

1593
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,310
we are sending yep
and the second transaction yeah with the

1594
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:02,320
and the second transaction yeah with the
 

1595
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,670
and the second transaction yeah with the
zeros

1596
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:03,680
zeros
 

1597
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,349
zeros
yeah with the zero amount because the

1598
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:05,359
yeah with the zero amount because the
 

1599
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,510
yeah with the zero amount because the
local tone doesn't produce the

1600
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:07,520
local tone doesn't produce the
 

1601
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,710
local tone doesn't produce the
empty blocks so in a bridge log

1602
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:10,720
empty blocks so in a bridge log
 

1603
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,910
empty blocks so in a bridge log
we can see the proposal yes it came

1604
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:13,920
we can see the proposal yes it came
 

1605
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,310
we can see the proposal yes it came
through

1606
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:14,320
through
 

1607
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,310
through
now we check the balance on the

1608
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:16,320
now we check the balance on the
 

1609
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,510
now we check the balance on the
substrate

1610
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:17,520
substrate
 

1611
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,870
substrate
side uh it's supposed to increase

1612
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:22,880
side uh it's supposed to increase
 

1613
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,870
side uh it's supposed to increase
hold on a second let's see okay the

1614
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:24,880
hold on a second let's see okay the
 

1615
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,990
hold on a second let's see okay the
balance has increased and let's see the

1616
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,000
balance has increased and let's see the
 

1617
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,829
balance has increased and let's see the
transaction details that it exactly 100

1618
00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:34,839

 

1619
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,630

yep

1620
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:38,640

 

1621
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,150

okay uh just just to explain the numbers

1622
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,160
okay uh just just to explain the numbers
 

1623
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,470
okay uh just just to explain the numbers
on the substrate account are not whole

1624
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:44,480
on the substrate account are not whole
 

1625
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,190
on the substrate account are not whole
uh because there was a commission on the

1626
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:47,200
uh because there was a commission on the
 

1627
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,950
uh because there was a commission on the
substrate side when we

1628
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:48,960
substrate side when we
 

1629
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,069
substrate side when we
transfer the money first so to conclude

1630
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:52,079
transfer the money first so to conclude
 

1631
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,109
transfer the money first so to conclude
the token transfer between blockchains

1632
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:55,119
the token transfer between blockchains
 

1633
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,470
the token transfer between blockchains
uh we also wanted to say in regards to

1634
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:58,480
uh we also wanted to say in regards to
 

1635
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,630
uh we also wanted to say in regards to
continuous integration that we have

1636
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:00,640
continuous integration that we have
 

1637
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,510
continuous integration that we have
created

1638
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:01,520
created
 

1639
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,630
created
a few scripts to

1640
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:04,640
a few scripts to
 

1641
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,950
a few scripts to
build and deliver our docket containers

1642
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:06,960
build and deliver our docket containers
 

1643
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,630

now anything
 

1801
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,030
now anything
would it be proposal or contest

1802
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,040
would it be proposal or contest
 

1803
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,950
would it be proposal or contest
absolutely because the timing is the

1804

absolutely because the timing is the
 

1805
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,950
absolutely because the timing is the
same it won't give any any progress on

1806

same it won't give any any progress on
 

1807

same it won't give any any progress on
the timing and

1808
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:27,680
the timing and
 

1809
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,670
the timing and
it's not fitting in the proposal

1810
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:29,680
it's not fitting in the proposal
 

1811
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,589
it's not fitting in the proposal
description doesn't matter if you have a

00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:31,599
description doesn't matter if you have a
 

1813
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,510
description doesn't matter if you have a
contest and even one participant in this

1814

yeah yeah i understand but just just

1818
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:37,599
yeah yeah i understand but just just
 

1819
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,430
yeah yeah i understand but just just
like from the logic standpoint i mean i

1820
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:39,440
like from the logic standpoint i mean i
 

1821
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,550
like from the logic standpoint i mean i
understand first stage one for design i

1822
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:42,560
understand first stage one for design i
 

1823
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,069
understand first stage one for design i
understand for stage two

1824
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:44,079
understand for stage two
 

1825
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,550
understand for stage two
like initial implementation but like if

1826
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:46,560
like initial implementation but like if
 

1827
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,069
like initial implementation but like if
you have one

1828
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:48,079
you have one
 

1829
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,910
you have one
team left nobody else would come to the

1830
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:49,920
team left nobody else would come to the
 

1831
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,190
team left nobody else would come to the
contest and then make a lot of sense

1832
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:51,200
contest and then make a lot of sense
 

1833
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,510
contest and then make a lot of sense
like

1834
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:51,520
like
 

1835
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,510
like
well logical we don't know that

1836
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:55,520
well logical we don't know that
 

1837
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,190
well logical we don't know that
we don't know that and there is no way

1838
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:57,200
we don't know that and there is no way
 

1839
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,109
we don't know that and there is no way
to to distribute tokens otherwise

1840
00:41:59,109 --> 00:41:59,119
to to distribute tokens otherwise
 

1841
00:41:59,119 --> 00:41:59,910
to to distribute tokens otherwise
proposals

1842
00:41:59,910 --> 00:41:59,920
proposals
 

1843
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,670
proposals
partnerships are not for that and you

1844
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:01,680
partnerships are not for that and you
 

1845
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,829
partnerships are not for that and you
know partnerships has a criteria

1846
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:03,839
know partnerships has a criteria
 

1847
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,470
know partnerships has a criteria
and the developers development contest

1848
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:06,480
and the developers development contest
 

1849
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,750
and the developers development contest
has another criteria

1850
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:07,760
has another criteria
 

1851
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,750
has another criteria
so it could what did it change nothing

1852
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:09,760
so it could what did it change nothing
 

1853
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,349
so it could what did it change nothing
but at the same time and i'm okay but

1854
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:11,359
but at the same time and i'm okay but
 

1855
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:11,670
but at the same time and i'm okay but
just

1856
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:11,680
just
 

1857
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,349
just
doesn't really make a lot of sense from

1858
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:13,359
doesn't really make a lot of sense from
 

1859
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,030
doesn't really make a lot of sense from
the logic standpoint

1860
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,040
the logic standpoint
 

1861
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,950
the logic standpoint
it does because nobody prevents anyone

1862
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:16,960
it does because nobody prevents anyone
 

1863
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,349
it does because nobody prevents anyone
else to actually participate even in the

1864
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:19,359
else to actually participate even in the
 

1865
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,950
else to actually participate even in the
stage three we cannot

1866
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:20,960
stage three we cannot
 

1867
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,990
stage three we cannot
be certain that no one just sit there

1868
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:24,000
be certain that no one just sit there
 

1869
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,550
be certain that no one just sit there
and

1870
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:24,560
and
 

1871
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,309
and
develop the whole thing and just rolled

1872
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:26,319
develop the whole thing and just rolled
 

1873
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,750
develop the whole thing and just rolled
it in the third stage

1874
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:27,760
it in the third stage
 

1875
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,190
it in the third stage
theoretically it's possible

1876
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:33,200

 

1877
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,630

but anyway uh winter stream so uh

1878
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:36,640
but anyway uh winter stream so uh
 

1879
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,069
but anyway uh winter stream so uh
i think that you can give some

1880
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:38,079
i think that you can give some
 

1881
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,390
i think that you can give some
estimations uh on as

1882
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:40,400
estimations uh on as
 

1883
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,950
estimations uh on as
timing that you need to to deliver the

1884
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:42,960
timing that you need to to deliver the
 

1885
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,069
timing that you need to to deliver the
first the full thing

1886
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:44,079
first the full thing
 

1887
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,349
first the full thing
and uh as you will just lead in

1888
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:47,359
and uh as you will just lead in
 

1889
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,870
and uh as you will just lead in
uh this development and uh it is correct

1890
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:50,880
uh this development and uh it is correct
 

1891
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,349
uh this development and uh it is correct
that you're

1892
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:51,359
that you're
 

1893
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,829
that you're
the only one active team as far as i see

1894
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:53,839
the only one active team as far as i see
 

1895
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:54,470
the only one active team as far as i see
so uh

1896
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:54,480
so uh
 

1897
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,069
so uh
you can say that okay guys so we're

1898
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:56,079
you can say that okay guys so we're
 

1899
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,390
you can say that okay guys so we're
ready to deliver it within one month

1900
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:58,400
ready to deliver it within one month
 

1901
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,270
ready to deliver it within one month
so we can just make it simpler simpler

1902
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:01,280
so we can just make it simpler simpler
 

1903
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,950
so we can just make it simpler simpler
so and with a much

1904
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:02,960
so and with a much
 

1905
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,990
so and with a much
shorter period so no need to wait uh

1906
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:06,000
shorter period so no need to wait uh
 

1907
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,589
shorter period so no need to wait uh
one month for each iteration okay yeah

1908
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:09,599
one month for each iteration okay yeah
 

1909
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,670
one month for each iteration okay yeah
let's start yes we will look into this

1910
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:11,680
let's start yes we will look into this
 

1911
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,630
let's start yes we will look into this
and we will do

1912
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:12,640
and we will do
 

1913
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,030
and we will do
the estimation on the timing alexander

1914
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:15,040
the estimation on the timing alexander
 

1915
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,069
the estimation on the timing alexander

we can take and do local testing
 

1993
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,990
we can take and do local testing
for understanding that all what we

1994

for understanding that all what we
 

1995
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,349
for understanding that all what we
see now them are working in this way

tokens are transferred correctly
and as soon as it's ready we will do the

2028
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:29,760
and as soon as it's ready we will do the
 

2029
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,190
and as soon as it's ready we will do the
submission and of course you will see

the
 

2033
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,750
the
code just as uh as the last time as

2034
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:33,760
code just as uh as the last time as
 

2035
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,349

last time was uh pretty good and was

2038
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:38,400
last time was uh pretty good and was
 

2039
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,990
last time was uh pretty good and was
easy to testing uh your container

2040
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:42,000
easy to testing uh your container
 

2041
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,309
easy to testing uh your container
and if it will be in the same way it

2042

2073
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,309

three two one no uh all right

2074
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:28,319
three two one no uh all right
 

2075
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,910
three two one no uh all right
uh so um then we move into the

2076
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:31,920
uh so um then we move into the
 

2077
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,390
uh so um then we move into the
last topic of the today's agenda so it's

2078

more uh
 

2081
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,630
more uh
more the topic for discussion and just

2082
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:38,640
more the topic for discussion and just
 

2083
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,270
more the topic for discussion and just
to hear

2084
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:39,280
to hear
 

2085
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,109
to hear
uh different points of view um

2086
00:46:43,109 --> 00:46:43,119
uh different points of view um
 

2087
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,589
uh different points of view um
it's about the tip three uh token

2088
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:45,599
it's about the tip three uh token
 

2089
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:46,470
it's about the tip three uh token
standard

2090
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:46,480
standard
 

2091
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,470
standard
and uh right what's going on actually so

2092
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:50,480
and uh right what's going on actually so
 

2093
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,750
and uh right what's going on actually so
uh we have uh several teams already

2094
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:53,760
uh we have uh several teams already
 

2095
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,550
uh we have uh several teams already
improving uh and upgrading they stock in

2096
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:56,560
improving uh and upgrading they stock in
 

2097
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,990
improving uh and upgrading they stock in
sterling because they

2098
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:58,000
sterling because they
 

2099
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,030
sterling because they
uh lack some functionalities

2100
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:01,040
uh lack some functionalities
 

2101
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,950
uh lack some functionalities
in it like for example for ton bridge

2102
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:04,960
in it like for example for ton bridge
 

2103
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,829
in it like for example for ton bridge
or for dex implementations and

2104
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:08,839
or for dex implementations and
 

2105
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,750
or for dex implementations and
uh there were several requests

2106
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:11,760
uh there were several requests
 

2107
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,950
uh there were several requests
to give more uh idea on

2108
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:14,960
to give more uh idea on
 

2109
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,790
to give more uh idea on
on how how this standard should evolve

2110
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:18,800
on how how this standard should evolve
 

2111
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,630
on how how this standard should evolve
uh in future and uh yeah so

2112
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:22,640
uh in future and uh yeah so
 

2113
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,430
uh in future and uh yeah so
i wish we will give word to media who

2114
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:25,440
i wish we will give word to media who
 

2115
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,670
i wish we will give word to media who
was a developer of this standard so meet

2116
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:27,680
was a developer of this standard so meet
 

2117
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,030
was a developer of this standard so meet
up please

2118
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:29,040
up please
 

2119
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,270
up please
yeah so we just had this exact same

2120
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:31,280
yeah so we just had this exact same
 

2121
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,069
yeah so we just had this exact same
discussion on

2122
00:47:32,069 --> 00:47:32,079
discussion on
 

2123
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,390
discussion on
uh developer experience of governance

2124
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:34,400
uh developer experience of governance
 

2125
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,069
uh developer experience of governance
and even voted

2126
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:36,079
and even voted
 

2127
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,109
and even voted
so let me just briefly you know

2128
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:39,119
so let me just briefly you know
 

2129
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,870
so let me just briefly you know
explain what the discussion was

2130
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:40,880
explain what the discussion was
 

2131
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,309
explain what the discussion was
arguments and

2132
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:42,319
arguments and
 

2133
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,270
arguments and
conclusion at least from the developer

2134
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:45,280
conclusion at least from the developer
 

2135
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,790
conclusion at least from the developer
experience of gov

2136
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:46,800
experience of gov
 

2137
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,069
experience of gov
um i have created a repository i will

2138
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:50,079
um i have created a repository i will
 

2139
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:50,710
um i have created a repository i will
share it

2140
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:50,720
share it
 

2141
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,790
share it
in what in in today

2142
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:54,800

 

2143
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,349

which is a tip 3 kind of consortium

2144
00:47:59,349 --> 00:47:59,359
which is a tip 3 kind of consortium
 

2145
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:03,829
which is a tip 3 kind of consortium
and the idea is the following

2146
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:03,839

 

2147
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:09,270

so um let me explain

2148
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:09,280

 

2149
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,309

so there is a tip three mechanism

2150
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:12,319
so there is a tip three mechanism
 

2151
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,630
so there is a tip three mechanism
as you all know probably which is the

2152
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:14,640
as you all know probably which is the
 

2153
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,630
as you all know probably which is the
mechanism of how to create a distributed

2154
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:16,640
mechanism of how to create a distributed
 

2155
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,069
mechanism of how to create a distributed
token

2156
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:18,079
token
 

2157
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,230
token
how to verify the code of the token on

2158
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:20,240
how to verify the code of the token on
 

2159
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,069
how to verify the code of the token on
the other side how to trade between the

2160
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:22,079
the other side how to trade between the
 

2161
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,589
the other side how to trade between the
token between the wallet stock and

2162
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:23,599
token between the wallet stock and
 

2163
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:24,870
token between the wallet stock and
wallets

2164
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:24,880
wallets
 

2165
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,390
wallets
individually now transfer meaning now

2166
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:28,400
individually now transfer meaning now
 

2167
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,910
individually now transfer meaning now
um we call tip three

2168
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:31,920
um we call tip three
 

2169
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,750
um we call tip three
this mechanism all the

2170
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:35,760
this mechanism all the
 

2171
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,109
this mechanism all the
current proposals relate to

2172
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:39,119
current proposals relate to
 

2173
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,309
current proposals relate to
interfaces of t3 token so different

2174
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:42,319
interfaces of t3 token so different
 

2175
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,109
interfaces of t3 token so different
different interfaces and functions to

2176
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:45,119
different interfaces and functions to
 

2177
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,069
different interfaces and functions to
kind of

2178
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:46,079
kind of
 

2179
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,589
kind of
extend well the interface and

2180
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:49,599
extend well the interface and
 

2181
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,790
extend well the interface and
the idea behind this was

2182
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:52,800
the idea behind this was
 

2183
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,309
the idea behind this was
kind of um in process of

2184
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:56,319
kind of um in process of
 

2185
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,990
kind of um in process of
how we standardize the

2186
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:00,000
how we standardize the
 

2187
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,430
how we standardize the
api basically of this token

2188
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:03,440
api basically of this token
 

2189
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,870
api basically of this token
now we started discussion with brooks's

2190
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:06,880
now we started discussion with brooks's
 

2191
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,270
now we started discussion with brooks's
team on the aba proposals that they had

2192
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:09,280
team on the aba proposals that they had
 

2193
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,790
team on the aba proposals that they had
and there is some proposal

2194
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:10,800
and there is some proposal
 

2195
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,870
and there is some proposal
on the forum that listed there and so on

2196
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:12,880
on the forum that listed there and so on
 

2197
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,109
on the forum that listed there and so on
and we were trying like to discuss

2198
00:49:15,109 --> 00:49:15,119
and we were trying like to discuss
 

2199
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,549
and we were trying like to discuss
of how we can harmonize this api

2200
00:49:18,549 --> 00:49:18,559
of how we can harmonize this api
 

2201
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,190
of how we can harmonize this api
we also in turn labs are implementing

2202
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:21,200
we also in turn labs are implementing
 

2203
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,790
we also in turn labs are implementing
now distribute this decentralized

2204
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:22,800
now distribute this decentralized
 

2205
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,710
now distribute this decentralized
exchange

2206

exchange
 

2207
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,750
exchange
and uh we also kind of

2208
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:27,760
and uh we also kind of
 

2209
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,109
and uh we also kind of
had a you know we needed to change

2210
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:31,119
had a you know we needed to change
 

2211
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:35,670
had a you know we needed to change
the api as well and uh and we also

2212
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:35,680
the api as well and uh and we also
 

2213
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,950
the api as well and uh and we also
needed to make it so

2214
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:38,960
needed to make it so
 

2215
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,829
needed to make it so
that it will fit into one message

2216
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:42,839
that it will fit into one message
 

2217
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:46,150
that it will fit into one message
deploy and when we

2218
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:46,160
deploy and when we
 

2219
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,349
deploy and when we
kind of collected all of it together we

2220
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:49,359
kind of collected all of it together we
 

2221
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,230
kind of collected all of it together we
realized that there is no way to do that

2222
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:52,240
realized that there is no way to do that
 

2223
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,430
realized that there is no way to do that
meaning you cannot leave

2224
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:55,440
meaning you cannot leave
 

2225
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,829
meaning you cannot leave
a creator talking with an interfaces

2226
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:57,839
a creator talking with an interfaces
 

2227
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,670
a creator talking with an interfaces
that will be universally good for

2228
00:49:59,670 --> 00:49:59,680
that will be universally good for
 

2229
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,710
that will be universally good for
everyone

2230
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:00,720
everyone
 

2231
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,230
everyone
that's one point another point much

2232
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:04,240
that's one point another point much
 

2233
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,750
that's one point another point much
more problematic is that

2234
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:07,760
more problematic is that
 

2235
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,790
more problematic is that
actually you cannot have a

2236
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:10,800
actually you cannot have a
 

2237
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,270
actually you cannot have a
compatible tip three tokens on the level

2238
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:13,280
compatible tip three tokens on the level
 

2239
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,230
compatible tip three tokens on the level
of interaction between t3 tokens because

2240
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:16,240
of interaction between t3 tokens because
 

2241
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,829
of interaction between t3 tokens because
in order to make them compatible you

2242
00:50:17,829 --> 00:50:17,839
in order to make them compatible you
 

2243
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:20,150
in order to make them compatible you
need to make them binary compatible

2244
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:20,160
need to make them binary compatible
 

2245
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,549
need to make them binary compatible
which is absolutely unrealistic because

2246
00:50:22,549 --> 00:50:22,559
which is absolutely unrealistic because
 

2247
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,470
which is absolutely unrealistic because
you would not only need to write them in

2248
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:24,480
you would not only need to write them in
 

2249
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,069
you would not only need to write them in
the same language you would also

2250
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:26,079
the same language you would also
 

2251
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:27,750
the same language you would also
need to compile them with the same

2252
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:27,760
need to compile them with the same
 

2253
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,910
need to compile them with the same
compiler all the time

2254
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:29,920
compiler all the time
 

2255
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,030
compiler all the time
which makes it absolutely no go

2256
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:33,040
which makes it absolutely no go
 

2257
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,549
which makes it absolutely no go
so so this leaves us with the following

2258
00:50:36,549 --> 00:50:36,559
so so this leaves us with the following
 

2259
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,069
so so this leaves us with the following
we have a growing request for changing

2260
00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:40,079
we have a growing request for changing
 

2261
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,670
we have a growing request for changing
in the uh interface level making the

2262
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:43,680
in the uh interface level making the
 

2263
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,030
in the uh interface level making the
uh compatibility issue

2264
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:47,040
uh compatibility issue
 

2265
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,950
uh compatibility issue
an issue of the size actually of the

2266
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:50,960
an issue of the size actually of the
 

2267
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,510
an issue of the size actually of the
of the token and at the same time we

2268
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:53,520
of the token and at the same time we
 

2269
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,430
of the token and at the same time we
have a situation where we cannot

2270
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:55,440
have a situation where we cannot
 

2271
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,910
have a situation where we cannot
actually ensure the binary compatibility

2272
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:57,920
actually ensure the binary compatibility
 

2273
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,870
actually ensure the binary compatibility
of the token

2274
00:50:58,870 --> 00:50:58,880
of the token
 

2275
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,069
of the token
implementation which leads us

2276
00:51:02,069 --> 00:51:02,079
implementation which leads us
 

2277
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,270
implementation which leads us
to i think the only logical conclusion

2278
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:05,280
to i think the only logical conclusion
 

2279
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,790
to i think the only logical conclusion
that we should not

2280
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:06,800
that we should not
 

2281
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,589
that we should not
try to harmonize the interfaces because

2282
00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:09,599
try to harmonize the interfaces because
 

2283
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,910
try to harmonize the interfaces because
it doesn't make any sense

2284
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:11,920
it doesn't make any sense
 

2285
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,670
it doesn't make any sense
therefore the uh proposal is the for and

2286
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:15,680
therefore the uh proposal is the for and
 

2287
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,870
therefore the uh proposal is the for and
okay so let me uh pros and cons

2288
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:18,880
okay so let me uh pros and cons
 

2289
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,790
okay so let me uh pros and cons
the process okay we don't harmonize that

2290
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:22,800
the process okay we don't harmonize that
 

2291
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,710
the process okay we don't harmonize that
now because we actually cannot the

2292
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:26,720
now because we actually cannot the
 

2293
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,549
now because we actually cannot the
cons of that is that now

2294
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:30,559
cons of that is that now
 

2295
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,910
cons of that is that now
we have an on-chain compatibility

2296
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:33,920
we have an on-chain compatibility
 

2297
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,710
we have an on-chain compatibility
problem

2298
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:34,720
problem
 

2299
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,349
problem
composability problem and off chain

2300
00:51:37,349 --> 00:51:37,359
composability problem and off chain
 

2301
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,589
composability problem and off chain
compatibility problem

2302
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:39,599
compatibility problem
 

2303
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,790
compatibility problem
now let's discuss two of them the on

2304
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:42,800
now let's discuss two of them the on
 

2305
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,710
now let's discuss two of them the on
chain composibility problem because we

2306
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:44,720
chain composibility problem because we
 

2307
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,150
chain composibility problem because we
cannot

2308
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:46,160
cannot
 

2309
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,150
cannot
have the binary compatibility any way we

2310
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:48,160
have the binary compatibility any way we
 

2311
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,630
have the binary compatibility any way we
will have it so when you

2312
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:50,640
will have it so when you
 

2313
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,270
will have it so when you
have to create an interface for example

2314
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:53,280
have to create an interface for example
 

2315
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,150
have to create an interface for example
a dex

2316
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:54,160
a dex
 

2317
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,230
a dex
which need to talk to different type

2318
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:56,240
which need to talk to different type
 

2319
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,990
which need to talk to different type
three implementations

2320
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:58,000
three implementations
 

2321
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,990
three implementations
because you cannot harmonize them you

2322
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:00,000
because you cannot harmonize them you
 

2323
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,069
because you cannot harmonize them you
will need to probably create some kind

2324
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:02,079
will need to probably create some kind
 

2325
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:02,950
will need to probably create some kind
of contracts

2326
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:02,960
of contracts
 

2327
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,990
of contracts
that will interface with them and

2328
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:06,000
that will interface with them and
 

2329
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,270
that will interface with them and
then work around this issue either you

2330
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:09,280
then work around this issue either you
 

2331
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,270
then work around this issue either you
create a large contract which

2332
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:11,280
create a large contract which
 

2333
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,270
create a large contract which
which has all the interfaces that you

2334
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:13,280
which has all the interfaces that you
 

2335
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,109
which has all the interfaces that you
need implemented there

2336
00:52:15,109 --> 00:52:15,119
need implemented there
 

2337
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,750
need implemented there
and has all the codes binary codes of

2338
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:17,760
and has all the codes binary codes of
 

2339
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,150
and has all the codes binary codes of
the

2340
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:18,160
the
 

2341
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,190
the
of this of this binary compatible

2342
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:21,200
of this of this binary compatible
 

2343
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,109
of this of this binary compatible
meaning codes of all this

2344
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:23,119
meaning codes of all this
 

2345
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,430
meaning codes of all this
tip tree that you want to support or you

2346
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:25,440
tip tree that you want to support or you
 

2347
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,190
tip tree that you want to support or you
create some kind of wrappers

2348
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:27,200
create some kind of wrappers
 

2349
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,870
create some kind of wrappers
around them that one deploy depose

2350
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:30,880
around them that one deploy depose
 

2351
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,510
around them that one deploy depose
you know make a deposit of one code and

2352
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:33,520
you know make a deposit of one code and
 

2353
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,190
you know make a deposit of one code and
getting another

2354
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:35,200
getting another
 

2355
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,829
getting another
so there are ways around that the

2356
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:37,839
so there are ways around that the
 

2357
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:38,630
so there are ways around that the
problem is that

2358
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:38,640
problem is that
 

2359
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,589
problem is that
there is no way to to have a different

2360
00:52:41,589 --> 00:52:41,599
there is no way to to have a different
 

2361
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,069
there is no way to to have a different
way

2362
00:52:42,069 --> 00:52:42,079
way
 

2363
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,870
way
it's just not working um and on the

2364
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:46,880
it's just not working um and on the
 

2365
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,109
it's just not working um and on the
front end size side the

2366
00:52:51,109 --> 00:52:51,119
front end size side the
 

2367
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,910
front end size side the
harmonization of the front end in

2368
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:53,920
harmonization of the front end in
 

2369
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,710
harmonization of the front end in
freetone

2370
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:54,720
freetone
 

2371
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,829
freetone
is reached through tibots

2372
00:52:57,829 --> 00:52:57,839
is reached through tibots
 

2373
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,230
is reached through tibots
mechanism and not through abi

2374
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:00,240
mechanism and not through abi
 

2375
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,790

2376
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:02,800
compatibility
 

2377
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,190
compatibility

there is no need for any proxy it's uh
and surf is just an example of the

blockchain browser
 

2435
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,390
blockchain browser
which supports the bot you can create

2436
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:02,400
which supports the bot you can create

your own browser
 

2439
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,710
your own browser
or add sdbot support in your

00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:06,720
or add sdbot support in your
 

2441
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,030
or add sdbot support in your
wallet and it will immediately support

all the debugs as long as you follow

2444
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:11,520
all the debugs as long as you follow
 

2445
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,230
all the debugs as long as you follow
the debug engine start standards which

2446
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:14,240
the debug engine start standards which
 

2447
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,630
the debug engine start standards which
described in is consortium

2448
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:16,640
described in is consortium
 

2449
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,750
described in is consortium
so the idea is to have a

2450
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:19,760
so the idea is to have a
 

2451
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,349
so the idea is to have a
same consortium for tip 3 and say

2452
00:54:23,349 --> 00:54:23,359
same consortium for tip 3 and say
 

2453
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,630
same consortium for tip 3 and say
that we actually like you can add

2454
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:26,640
that we actually like you can add
 

2455
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,750
that we actually like you can add
interfaces as much as you like and the

2456
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:29,760
interfaces as much as you like and the
 

2457
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,790
interfaces as much as you like and the
only rule is

2458
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:30,800
only rule is
 

2459
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,750
only rule is
for t3 talking is that the the actual

2460
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:33,760
for t3 talking is that the the actual
 

2461
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,950
for t3 talking is that the the actual
mechanism of

2462
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:34,960
mechanism of
 

2463
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,230
mechanism of
tip 3 token is the same meaning you

2464
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:38,240
tip 3 token is the same meaning you
 

2465
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,470
tip 3 token is the same meaning you
don't change that

2466
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:40,480
don't change that
 

2467
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,150
don't change that
and if you want to change that then we

2468
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:42,160
and if you want to change that then we
 

2469
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,549
and if you want to change that then we
need to talk because this is a security

2470
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:44,559
need to talk because this is a security
 

2471
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:45,750
need to talk because this is a security
issue

2472
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:45,760
issue
 

2473
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,390
issue
so you have this mechanism of verifying

2474
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:48,400
so you have this mechanism of verifying
 

2475
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,150
so you have this mechanism of verifying
the code of the contract code and you

2476
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:50,160
the code of the contract code and you
 

2477
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,670
the code of the contract code and you
know and and all that stuff

2478
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:51,680
know and and all that stuff
 

2479
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,309
know and and all that stuff
internally and on the external side

2480
00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:54,319
internally and on the external side
 

2481
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:55,109
internally and on the external side
maybe

2482
00:54:55,109 --> 00:54:55,119
maybe
 

2483
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,470
maybe
we agree on like one or two interfaces

2484
00:54:58,470 --> 00:54:58,480
we agree on like one or two interfaces
 

2485
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,390
we agree on like one or two interfaces
like transfer for example something like

2486
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:00,400
like transfer for example something like
 

2487
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:00,950
like transfer for example something like
that which

2488
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:00,960
that which
 

2489
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,510
that which
should be supported anyway and then on

2490
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:03,520
should be supported anyway and then on
 

2491
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,230
should be supported anyway and then on
top of that

2492
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:04,240
top of that
 

2493
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,309
top of that
you can add as much as you want

2494
00:55:06,309 --> 00:55:06,319
you can add as much as you want
 

2495
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,630
you can add as much as you want
interfaces and if anyone wants to

2496
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:08,640
interfaces and if anyone wants to
 

2497
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,829
interfaces and if anyone wants to
support your

2498
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:09,839
support your
 

2499
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:13,990
support your
tip three api uh in t3 token

2500
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:14,000
tip three api uh in t3 token
 

2501
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,470
tip three api uh in t3 token
it goes to this consortium where you

2502
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:16,480
it goes to this consortium where you
 

2503
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,829
it goes to this consortium where you
list all these changes

2504
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:17,839
list all these changes
 

2505
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,630
list all these changes
and and supports them on their own chain

2506
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:20,640
and and supports them on their own chain
 

2507
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,829

you know smart contract

2508
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:21,839
you know smart contract
 

2509
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:25,510
you know smart contract
and we believe that this is the only way

and we believe that this is the only way
 

2511
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,789
and we believe that this is the only way
to actually you know have this kind of

2512
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:28,799
to actually you know have this kind of
 

2513
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,309
to actually you know have this kind of
standard

2514

standard
 

2515
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:33,750

that's the way web operated i don't

2756
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:47,280
that's the way web operated i don't
 

2757
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,630
that's the way web operated i don't
think we need to change that

2758
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:48,640
think we need to change that
 

2759
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,710
think we need to change that
and i don't think it's a failed model i

2760
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:50,720
and i don't think it's a failed model i
 

2761
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:51,990
and i don't think it's a failed model i
think this model proved

2762
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:52,000
think this model proved
 

2763
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,230
think this model proved
itself very good um

2764
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:56,240
itself very good um
 

2765
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,190
itself very good um
it's just impossible to create

2766
01:00:59,190 --> 01:00:59,200
it's just impossible to create
 

2767
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,349
it's just impossible to create
compatibility on abi level we just

2768
01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:01,359
compatibility on abi level we just
 

2769
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,430
compatibility on abi level we just
discussed that so i don't think there is

2770
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:03,440
discussed that so i don't think there is
 

2771
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,670
discussed that so i don't think there is
also not only that is good there is also

2772
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:05,680
also not only that is good there is also
 

2773
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,270
also not only that is good there is also
no other way

2774
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:07,280
no other way
 

2775
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,710
no other way
to do that so again you can

2776
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:10,720
to do that so again you can
 

2777
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,829
to do that so again you can
create a you can be compatible with

2778
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:13,839
create a you can be compatible with
 

2779
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:17,190
create a you can be compatible with
any abi on

2780
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:17,200
any abi on

the tip three if you just implement it

2782
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:19,200
the tip three if you just implement it
 

2783
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,390
the tip three if you just implement it
manually

01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:20,400
manually
 

2785
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,789
manually
on the tip three consortium level so you

2786
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:22,799
on the tip three consortium level so you
 

2787
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:25,190
on the tip three consortium level so you
have tip three there are listed

2788
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:25,200
have tip three there are listed
 

2789
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,430
have tip three there are listed
you know interfaces there you can take

2790
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:27,440
you know interfaces there you can take
 

2791
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,750
you know interfaces there you can take
these interfaces and implement them

2792
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:29,760
these interfaces and implement them
 

2793
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,430
these interfaces and implement them
you know one by one in your wallet

2794
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:31,440
you know one by one in your wallet
 

2795
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,829
you know one by one in your wallet
instead of implementing the debug engine

01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:33,839
instead of implementing the debug engine
 

2797
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:37,510
instead of implementing the debug engine
uh it is is it a good way to do that

2798
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:37,520
uh it is is it a good way to do that
 

2799
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,349
uh it is is it a good way to do that
i don't think so but it's up to you it's

2800
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:39,359
i don't think so but it's up to you it's
 

2801
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,109
i don't think so but it's up to you it's
up to the wallet developer and they want

2802
01:01:41,109 --> 01:01:41,119
up to the wallet developer and they want
 

2803
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:42,390
up to the wallet developer and they want
to do it this way

2804
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:42,400
to do it this way
 

2805
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,910
to do it this way
which is uh you know in ethereum proof

2806
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:45,920
which is uh you know in ethereum proof
 

2807
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:46,630
which is uh you know in ethereum proof
that's

2808
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:46,640
that's
 

2809
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,470
that's
absolutely you know not

2810
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:50,480
absolutely you know not
 

2811
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,270
absolutely you know not
not good we can see that it's a failed

2812
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:53,280
not good we can see that it's a failed
 

2813

but if you want to follow that you have

2816
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:55,760
but if you want to follow that you have
 

2817
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,029
but if you want to follow that you have
this choice so

2818
01:01:57,029 --> 01:01:57,039
this choice so
 

2819
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,190
this choice so
we kind of have all of the choices you

2820
01:01:59,190 --> 01:01:59,200
we kind of have all of the choices you
 

2821
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,950
we kind of have all of the choices you
want right

2822
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:00,960
want right
 

2823
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,069
want right
and uh you know if you also

2824
01:02:04,069 --> 01:02:04,079
and uh you know if you also
 

2825
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:06,390
and uh you know if you also
like if you don't like then propose it

2826
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:06,400
like if you don't like then propose it
 

2827
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,109
like if you don't like then propose it
because

2828
01:02:07,109 --> 01:02:07,119
because
 

2829
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:08,870
because
again as i said even if we create this

2830
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:08,880
again as i said even if we create this
 

2831
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,270
again as i said even if we create this
universal standard of apis

2832
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:11,280
universal standard of apis
 

2833
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,109
universal standard of apis
we will not be able to create a

2834
01:02:13,109 --> 01:02:13,119
we will not be able to create a

so like i don't see why it shouldn't

2840
01:02:18,829 --> 01:02:18,839
so like i don't see why it shouldn't
 

2841
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:22,069
so like i don't see why it shouldn't
work

2842

01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,549

i'm afraid that many of you start

you just go to the consortium of tip

2856
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:48,720
you just go to the consortium of tip
 

2857
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,470
you just go to the consortium of tip
three and you just support all the tip

2858
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:50,480
three and you just support all the tip

uh that t3s that list that

2862
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:53,920
uh that t3s that list that
 

2863
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,230
uh that t3s that list that
implementation that listed there

2864

implementation that listed there
 

2865
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:00,470
implementation that listed there
um you cannot

2866
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:00,480

 

2867
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,789

uh if there is a way to check

2868
01:03:02,789 --> 01:03:02,799
uh if there is a way to check
 

2869
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:03,910
uh if there is a way to check
compatibility

2870
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:03,920
compatibility
 

2871
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,349

by code by binary code you you you can

2872
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:07,359
by code by binary code you you you can
 

2873
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:08,390
by code by binary code you you you can
do that so

2874
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:08,400
do that so
 

2875
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,589
do that so
any code any tip three that follows

2876
01:03:11,589 --> 01:03:11,599
any code any tip three that follows
 

2877
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:16,069
any code any tip three that follows
a particular you know as a particular

2881
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,750
binary and and the interface standards
combined com you know compiled with a

01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:21,760
combined com you know compiled with a
 

2883
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,549
combined com you know compiled with a
similar

01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:22,559
similar
 

2885
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:25,829
similar
same com compiler

2886
01:03:25,829 --> 01:03:25,839
same com compiler
 

2887
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:27,829
same com compiler
basically having the same binary code

2888
01:03:27,829 --> 01:03:27,839
basically having the same binary code
 

2889
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,069
basically having the same binary code
will be working with your decks

2890
01:03:30,069 --> 01:03:30,079
will be working with your decks
 

2891
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:32,230
will be working with your decks
but if you have a new token coming you

2892
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:32,240
but if you have a new token coming you
 

2893
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,150
but if you have a new token coming you
will need to support that token

2894
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:34,160
will need to support that token
 

2895
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,750
will need to support that token
meaning that if you have a token which

2896
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:35,760
meaning that if you have a token which
 

2897
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,549
meaning that if you have a token which
is even the same token but just com

2898
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:38,559
is even the same token but just com
 

2899
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,589
is even the same token but just com
compiled with the latest version um

2900
01:03:41,589 --> 01:03:41,599
compiled with the latest version um
 

2901
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,750
compiled with the latest version um
you will still need to add that into

2902
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:43,760
you will still need to add that into
 

2903
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,190
you will still need to add that into
your into your decks

2904
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:45,200
your into your decks
 

2905
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:57,430
your into your decks
and there is simply no way around that

2906
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:57,440

 

2907
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,990

but i would say it's an improvement over

2908
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:00,000
but i would say it's an improvement over
 

2909
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,069
but i would say it's an improvement over
what you have now

2910
01:04:02,069 --> 01:04:02,079
what you have now
 

2911
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:05,589
what you have now
um in other chains

2912
01:04:05,589 --> 01:04:05,599
um in other chains
 

2913
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:08,870
um in other chains
but it's not you know ideal

2914
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:08,880
but it's not you know ideal
 

2915
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,950
but it's not you know ideal
well because there is no ideal in the

2916
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:10,960
well because there is no ideal in the
 

2917
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,190
well because there is no ideal in the
world i guess

2918
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:13,200
world i guess
 

2919
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:24,230
world i guess
as always a compromise

2920
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:24,240

 

2921
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,630

well what we're doing with our decks

2922
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:26,640
well what we're doing with our decks
 

2923
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:27,670
well what we're doing with our decks
just to add to that

2924
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:27,680
just to add to that
 

2925
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,270
just to add to that
is that we uh create a wrapper

2926
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:31,280
is that we uh create a wrapper
 

2927
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,589
is that we uh create a wrapper
and uh talk an internal token for the

2928
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:33,599
and uh talk an internal token for the
 

2929
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:34,470
and uh talk an internal token for the
decks

2930
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:34,480
decks
 

2931
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,510
decks
and you always can rap like

2932
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:37,520
and you always can rap like
 

2933
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,710
and you always can rap like
you can you can

2934
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:40,720
you can you can
 

2935
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:44,470
you can you can
you can create a like a wrapper factory

2936
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:44,480
you can create a like a wrapper factory
 

2937
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,990
you can create a like a wrapper factory
which if the wrapper is wrapping into

2938
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:48,000
which if the wrapper is wrapping into
 

2939
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:48,470
which if the wrapper is wrapping into
new

2940
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:48,480
new
 

2941
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,710
new
your dex token then it will be

2942
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:50,720
your dex token then it will be
 

2943
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,710
your dex token then it will be
automatically supported so if i have a

2944
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:52,720
automatically supported so if i have a
 

2945
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,390
automatically supported so if i have a
talk and a tip tree token

2946
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:54,400
talk and a tip tree token
 

2947
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,470
talk and a tip tree token
which i for some reason has you know

2948
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:56,480
which i for some reason has you know
 

2949
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,150
which i for some reason has you know
interface changed or

2950
01:04:58,150 --> 01:04:58,160
interface changed or
 

2951
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,910
interface changed or
binary code changed then i just need to

2952
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:01,920
binary code changed then i just need to
 

2953
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,910
binary code changed then i just need to
create a wrapper for your dex and it

2954
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:03,920
create a wrapper for your dex and it
 

2955
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,309
create a wrapper for your dex and it
will work immediately so you don't

2956
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:06,319
will work immediately so you don't
 

2957
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,230
will work immediately so you don't
you actually can't create this automatic

2958
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:08,240
you actually can't create this automatic
 

2959
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,990
you actually can't create this automatic
way to automatically add tokens there is

2960
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:10,000
way to automatically add tokens there is
 

2961
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,990
way to automatically add tokens there is
no problem with that

2962
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:14,000

 

2963
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,069

i think is it worth to mention videos

2964
01:05:16,069 --> 01:05:16,079
i think is it worth to mention videos
 

2965
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,589
i think is it worth to mention videos
that you mentioned on the works called

2966
01:05:17,589 --> 01:05:17,599
that you mentioned on the works called
 

2967
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:17,910
that you mentioned on the works called
that

2968
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:17,920
that
 

2969
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,910
that
there is a tip another tip in progress

2970
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:19,920
there is a tip another tip in progress
 

2971
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,950
there is a tip another tip in progress
like maybe you

2972
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:20,960
like maybe you
 

2973
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,950
like maybe you
can introduce

2974
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:24,960
can introduce
 

2975
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,829
can introduce
oh you mean for the debot address

2976
01:05:27,829 --> 01:05:27,839
oh you mean for the debot address
 

2977
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:29,510
oh you mean for the debot address
discovery right

2978
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:29,520
discovery right
 

2979
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,670
discovery right
yeah well but it's not related but it

2980
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:31,680
yeah well but it's not related but it
 

2981
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,430
yeah well but it's not related but it
may be related to the

uh design wants to add

2990
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:43,119
uh design wants to add
 

2991
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:45,670
uh design wants to add
yes user wants to add some token he just

2992
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:45,680
yes user wants to add some token he just
 

2993
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,349
yes user wants to add some token he just
like proposed this uh

2994
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:47,359
like proposed this uh
 

2995
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,109
like proposed this uh
name of the token and everything well

2996
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:49,119
name of the token and everything well
 

2997
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:50,870
name of the token and everything well
the question was about the dex that if

2998
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:50,880
the question was about the dex that if
 

2999
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:51,510
the question was about the dex that if
you want to

3000
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:51,520
you want to
 

3001
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,589
you want to
talk about the interface yeah then there

3002
01:05:53,589 --> 01:05:53,599
talk about the interface yeah then there
 

3003
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:54,630
talk about the interface yeah then there
will be a way

3004
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:54,640
will be a way
 

3005
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:58,069
will be a way
to automate the discovery of the um

3006
01:05:58,069 --> 01:05:58,079
to automate the discovery of the um
 

3007
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,750
to automate the discovery of the um
of the debot from the address of the

3008
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:01,760
of the debot from the address of the
 

3009
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,789
of the debot from the address of the
contract so you

3010
01:06:02,789 --> 01:06:02,799
contract so you
 

3011
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:05,109
contract so you
you have an address you can calculate

3012
01:06:05,109 --> 01:06:05,119
you have an address you can calculate
 

3013
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:06,470
you have an address you can calculate
the address of the debot

3014
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:06,480
the address of the debot
 

3015
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,430
the address of the debot
to this contract actually to 2d bots one

3016
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:09,440
to this contract actually to 2d bots one
 

3017
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,270
to this contract actually to 2d bots one
debate will be discovered based on the

3018
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:11,280
debate will be discovered based on the
 

3019
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,630
debate will be discovered based on the
hash code

3020
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:12,640
hash code
 

3021
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,349
hash code
of your contract so like any contract

3022
01:06:15,349 --> 01:06:15,359
of your contract so like any contract
 

3023
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:16,630
of your contract so like any contract
with the same hash code

3024
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:16,640
with the same hash code
 

3025
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,589
with the same hash code
maybe may have just an address of the

3026
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:19,599
maybe may have just an address of the
 

3027
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:20,230
maybe may have just an address of the
debot

3028
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:20,240
debot
 

3029
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:24,549
debot
discoverable on the on the client side

3030
01:06:24,549 --> 01:06:24,559
discoverable on the on the client side
 

3031
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:27,910
discoverable on the on the client side
and also the debug which based on just

3032
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:27,920
and also the debug which based on just
 

3033
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,190
and also the debug which based on just
this particular address

3034
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:29,200
this particular address
 

3035
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,510
this particular address
so this particular address discoverable

3036
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:31,520
so this particular address discoverable
 

3037
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,109
so this particular address discoverable
debug i mean it's quite easy to

3038
01:06:33,109 --> 01:06:33,119
debug i mean it's quite easy to
 

3039
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:35,670
debug i mean it's quite easy to
to realize that of course so you have

3040
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:35,680
to realize that of course so you have
 

3041
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,270
to realize that of course so you have
you have two ways to you have

3042
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:37,280
you have two ways to you have
 

3043
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,789
you have two ways to you have
you have a way to discover the general

3044
01:06:38,789 --> 01:06:38,799
you have a way to discover the general
 

3045
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:40,309
you have a way to discover the general
debate for the code

3046
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:40,319
