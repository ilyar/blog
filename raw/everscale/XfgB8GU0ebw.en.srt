this this actually raises the discussion

136
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
this this actually raises the discussion
 

137
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,910
this this actually raises the discussion
again about how many contests device

138
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
again about how many contests device
 

139
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,790
again about how many contests device
upgrades actually can host

140
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
upgrades actually can host
 

141
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,269
upgrades actually can host
simultaneously because you remember that

142
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
simultaneously because you remember that
 

143
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,670
simultaneously because you remember that
initially we

144
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
initially we
 

145
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,749
initially we
were

146
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:39,759
were
 

147
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,030
were
delay in some contests to let different

148
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
delay in some contests to let different
 

149
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,150
delay in some contests to let different
teams to participate and

150
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,160
teams to participate and
 

151
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,990
teams to participate and
now i feel that we should go back to

152
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
now i feel that we should go back to
 

153
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,110
now i feel that we should go back to
this practice because otherwise there

154
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
this practice because otherwise there
 

155
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,990
this practice because otherwise there
are too many events and too few commands

156
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
are too many events and too few commands
 

157
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,629
are too many events and too few commands
to a few teams who can participate in

158
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:56,639
to a few teams who can participate in
 

159
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,150
to a few teams who can participate in
these contests

160
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
these contests
 

161
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,350
these contests
and

162
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
and
 

163
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,150
and
maybe it's not good for

164
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160
maybe it's not good for
 

165
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,870
maybe it's not good for
such a complex area as sd5 to host

166
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
such a complex area as sd5 to host
 

167
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,389
such a complex area as sd5 to host

contest
 

241
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,630
contest
i think we have no other choice than to

prolong this uh or postpone it for some
time um

246
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:38,559
time um
 

247
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,029
time um
we will be able to participate uh only

248
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:41,039
we will be able to participate uh only
 

249
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,510
we will be able to participate uh only
after us cup finishes which is one month

250
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:43,520

postpone it if you consider postponing
that then you know

256
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
that then you know
 

257
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,190
that then you know
something like almost sounds good

258
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,200
something like almost sounds good
 

259
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,029
something like almost sounds good
actually uh uh oracle implementation was

260
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039
actually uh uh oracle implementation was
 

261
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,150
actually uh uh oracle implementation was
uh crucial for the stablecoin contest uh

262
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
uh crucial for the stablecoin contest uh
 

263
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,870
uh crucial for the stablecoin contest uh
and also for the lending cost contest uh

264
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:02,880
and also for the lending cost contest uh
 

265
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,870
and also for the lending cost contest uh
lending implementation that's why i

266
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:04,880
lending implementation that's why i
 

267
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,830
lending implementation that's why i
didn't uh actually post something uh for

268
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:07,840
didn't uh actually post something uh for
 

269
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,669
didn't uh actually post something uh for
the draft of the linux

270
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:09,679
the draft of the linux
 

271
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,750
the draft of the linux
protocol because there is absolutely no

272
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:11,760
protocol because there is absolutely no
 

273
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,590
protocol because there is absolutely no
sense doing this now and um

274
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:15,600
sense doing this now and um
 

275
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,110
sense doing this now and um
yeah so let's discuss uh actually for

276
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,120

 

277
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,750

if we should delay this contest and uh

if we should delay this contest and uh
 

279
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,230
if we should delay this contest and uh
for what period of time so i i heard two

280
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,240
for what period of time so i i heard two
 

281
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,750
for what period of time so i i heard two
opinions now so one from ivan

282
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
opinions now so one from ivan
 

283

00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,280
another one from italy now so that it
 

287
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,830
another one from italy now so that it
should be delayed until august

288
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:37,840
should be delayed until august
 

289
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,870
should be delayed until august
uh

290
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,880

let me speak some something yes please
 

295
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,510
let me speak some something yes please
yes i propose continue oracle contests

296
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
yes i propose continue oracle contests
 

297
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,470
yes i propose continue oracle contests
for

298
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
for
 

299
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,190

00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,080
good robust oracle for ecosystem from
 

305
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,150
good robust oracle for ecosystem from
frontal website

306
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160
frontal website
 

307
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,029

but
 

309
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,470
but
about stablecoin and etc i think we can

310
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
about stablecoin and etc i think we can
 

311
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,630
about stablecoin and etc i think we can
launch it and

312
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640

 

313
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,789

people who will who will create solution

314
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:04,799
people who will who will create solution
 

315
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,430
people who will who will create solution
can use chain link

316
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:07,440
can use chain link
 

317
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,430
can use chain link
for speed because a lot of different

318
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,440
for speed because a lot of different
 

319

protocols uh
 

321
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,110
protocols uh
we're using channeling

we're using channeling
 

323
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,630
we're using channeling
oracles and

324
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:16,640
oracles and
 

325
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,350
oracles and
and i think we can use to because uh

326
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
and i think we can use to because uh

the question is uh how we should connect
 

347
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,630
the question is uh how we should connect
to chain link so uh will be something

348
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:00,640
to chain link so uh will be something
 

349
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,190
to chain link so uh will be something
some kind of adapter to chain link from

695
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,070
actually two
power chains actually auctioned one is

696
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,080
power chains actually auctioned one is
 

697
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,430
power chains actually auctioned one is
karura

698
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:11,440
karura
 

699
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,149
karura
from pronounced right another one is uh

700
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:14,159
from pronounced right another one is uh
 

701
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,029
from pronounced right another one is uh
beam

702
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:15,039
beam
 

703
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,590
beam
and

704
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:17,600

 

705
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,549

if i understand it correctly so they

706
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:20,559
if i understand it correctly so they
 

707
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,230
if i understand it correctly so they
differ in the implementation of the

708
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:22,240
differ in the implementation of the
 

709
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,190
differ in the implementation of the
protein itself um but maybe you can

710
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,200
protein itself um but maybe you can
 

711
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,470
protein itself um but maybe you can
explain a bit more uh so

712
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:28,480
explain a bit more uh so
 

713
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,549
explain a bit more uh so
what's um

714
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:30,559
what's um
 

715
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,389
what's um
what's the difficulty uh from your

716
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:32,399
what's the difficulty uh from your
 

717
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,029
what's the difficulty uh from your
standpoint of integrating uh

718
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:35,039
standpoint of integrating uh
 

719
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:35,909
standpoint of integrating uh
your

720
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:35,919
your
 

721
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,950
your
polka dot uh endpoint to one of these

722
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:38,960
polka dot uh endpoint to one of these
 

723
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,990
polka dot uh endpoint to one of these
power chains so is it more about the

724
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,000
power chains so is it more about the
 

725
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,789
power chains so is it more about the
readiness of the ecosystem of these

726
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:44,799
readiness of the ecosystem of these
 

727
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,669
readiness of the ecosystem of these
power chains at first sight or maybe

728
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:47,679
power chains at first sight or maybe
 

729
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,830
power chains at first sight or maybe
there are some technical difficulties so

730
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:49,840
there are some technical difficulties so
 

731
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,110
there are some technical difficulties so
uh

732
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,120
uh
 

733
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,590
uh
yeah just give give some some advice

734
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:53,600
yeah just give give some some advice
 

735
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,830
yeah just give give some some advice
well it's actually from the both sides a

736
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:55,840
well it's actually from the both sides a
 

737
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,909
well it's actually from the both sides a
little bit from each one uh the polka

738
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:57,919
little bit from each one uh the polka
 

739
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,389
little bit from each one uh the polka
dot what what we are actually doing and

740
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:00,399
dot what what we are actually doing and
 

741
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,630
dot what what we are actually doing and
why we were waiting the first of all of

742
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:02,640
why we were waiting the first of all of
 

743
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,870
why we were waiting the first of all of
course we need to see where the people's

744
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:04,880
course we need to see where the people's
 

745
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,269
course we need to see where the people's
interests will go because now there are

746
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:07,279
interests will go because now there are
 

747
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,510
interests will go because now there are
four products four slots been taking

748
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:09,520
four products four slots been taking
 

749
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,230
four products four slots been taking
that's the latest news sort of

750
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,240
that's the latest news sort of
 

751
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,470
that's the latest news sort of
and uh

752
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:14,480
and uh
 

753
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,630
and uh
polkadot doesn't in the beginning the

754
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:16,640
polkadot doesn't in the beginning the
 

755
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,789
polkadot doesn't in the beginning the
technical problem or technical issue i

756
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:18,799
technical problem or technical issue i
 

757
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,630
technical problem or technical issue i
would say the polkadot doesn't have the

758
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:20,640
would say the polkadot doesn't have the
 

759
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,350
would say the polkadot doesn't have the
smart contracts by design itself

760
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,360
smart contracts by design itself
 

761
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,310
smart contracts by design itself
uh there is an ability to uh become a

762
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,320
uh there is an ability to uh become a
 

763
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,110
uh there is an ability to uh become a
power chain of course but uh because of

764
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,120
power chain of course but uh because of
 

765
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,070
power chain of course but uh because of
the high rivalry the parachain spots

766
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,080
the high rivalry the parachain spots
 

767
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,269
the high rivalry the parachain spots
cost too much uh we're talking about 32

768
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:35,279
cost too much uh we're talking about 32
 

769
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,430
cost too much uh we're talking about 32
33 million dollars

770
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:37,440
33 million dollars
 

771
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,750
33 million dollars
that's why we have decided to wait for

772
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:39,760
that's why we have decided to wait for
 

773
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,149
that's why we have decided to wait for
the generic products to be launched and

774
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:42,159
the generic products to be launched and
 

775
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,070
the generic products to be launched and
will give us the necessary ability to

776
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,080
will give us the necessary ability to
 

777
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,830
will give us the necessary ability to
build our products

778
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:45,840
build our products
 

779
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,190
build our products
uh based on generic ones

780
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,200
uh based on generic ones
 

781
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,230
uh based on generic ones
so

782
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:50,240
so
 

783
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,110
so
okay

784
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,120
okay
 

785
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,789
okay
okay yes

786
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:52,799
okay yes
 

787
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,029
okay yes
that's a piece from one side that we

788
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:55,039
that's a piece from one side that we
 

789
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,389
that's a piece from one side that we
uh cannot move on this uh this contest

790
00:28:58,389 --> 00:28:58,399
uh cannot move on this uh this contest
 

791
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,750
uh cannot move on this uh this contest
because

792
00:28:59,750 --> 00:28:59,760
because
 

793
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,470
because
of course having a working

794
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:02,480
of course having a working
 

795
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,669
of course having a working
end user product to the polka dots

796
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:05,679
end user product to the polka dots
 

797
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:06,630
end user product to the polka dots
would

798
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:06,640
would
 

799
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,870
would
be really great for the

800
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:08,880
be really great for the
 

801
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,870
be really great for the
media coverage and for the promoting

802
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:10,880
media coverage and for the promoting
 

803
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,070
media coverage and for the promoting
free tonic system but i agree that

804
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,080
free tonic system but i agree that
 

805
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,789
free tonic system but i agree that
there is no sense in doing the bridge to

806
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:16,799
there is no sense in doing the bridge to
 

807
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,870
there is no sense in doing the bridge to
nowhere so

808
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:18,880
nowhere so
 

809
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,669
nowhere so
we actually are doing bridges to help

810
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:21,679
we actually are doing bridges to help
 

811
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,269
we actually are doing bridges to help
liquidity flows and user flows

812
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:25,279
liquidity flows and user flows
 

813
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,950
liquidity flows and user flows
and if there is there is nothing on the

814
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:26,960
and if there is there is nothing on the
 

815
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,389
and if there is there is nothing on the
other side so

816
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:28,399
other side so
 

817
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,950
other side so
no sense to connect to the

818
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:30,960
no sense to connect to the
 

819
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,350
no sense to connect to the
dark hole thankfully thankfully it is

820
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,360
dark hole thankfully thankfully it is
 

821
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,669
dark hole thankfully thankfully it is
now so there is a possibility now

822
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:35,679
now so there is a possibility now
 

823
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,310
now so there is a possibility now
thankfully we have finished the basic

824
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:38,320
thankfully we have finished the basic
 

825
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,389
thankfully we have finished the basic
development by this time so it is i

826
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:40,399
development by this time so it is i
 

827
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,950
development by this time so it is i
think the timing is sort of not perfect

828
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:42,960
think the timing is sort of not perfect
 

829
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,029
think the timing is sort of not perfect
but very close to we're talking about

830
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:45,039
but very close to we're talking about
 

831
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,430
but very close to we're talking about
delay of one month which is it's not

832
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:47,440
delay of one month which is it's not
 

833
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,470
delay of one month which is it's not
great

834
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:48,480
great
 

835
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,269
great
uh but uh sometimes that happens

836
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:51,279
uh but uh sometimes that happens
 

837
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,110
uh but uh sometimes that happens
at the moment we have everything that

838
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,120
at the moment we have everything that
 

839
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,830
at the moment we have everything that
takes uh for us to come up with a great

840
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:55,840
takes uh for us to come up with a great
 

841
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,789
takes uh for us to come up with a great
product

842
00:29:56,789 --> 00:29:56,799
product
 

843
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,110
product
i mean we have a few ideas but

844
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,120
i mean we have a few ideas but
 

845
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,190
i mean we have a few ideas but
talking about them now i think it's

846
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,200
talking about them now i think it's
 

847
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,350
talking about them now i think it's
pointless because while we're doing this

848
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:03,360
pointless because while we're doing this
 

849
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,389
pointless because while we're doing this
research i'm sure we come up with a few

850
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:06,399
research i'm sure we come up with a few
 

851
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,190
research i'm sure we come up with a few
more ideas that will be more relative to

852
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:09,200
more ideas that will be more relative to
 

853
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,830
more ideas that will be more relative to
the situation and the situation right

854
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:11,840
the situation and the situation right
 

855
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,389
the situation and the situation right
now is sort of very very hot on a polka

856
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:14,399
now is sort of very very hot on a polka
 

857
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,350
now is sort of very very hot on a polka
dot side

858
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,360
dot side
 

859
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,230
dot side
okay

860
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,240
okay
 

861
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,470
okay
okay guys do you have some questions to

862
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:18,480
okay guys do you have some questions to
 

863

i have kind of dropped off architecture
 

873
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,510
i have kind of dropped off architecture
of bitcoin bridge and it's relatively

874
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:37,520
of bitcoin bridge and it's relatively
 

875
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,430
of bitcoin bridge and it's relatively
easy yeah it's

876
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:39,440

old contract so it's just based on
 

883
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,990
old contract so it's just based on
miracle proofs right

884
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,000
miracle proofs right
 

885
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,830

i just wanted to clarify kind of it
 

1059
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,270
i just wanted to clarify kind of it
in this design i may be

1060
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:09,280
in this design i may be
 

1061
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,829
in this design i may be
again mistake but in

1062
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:11,839
again mistake but in
 

1063
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,030
again mistake but in
this design which i kind of came up with

1064
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,040
this design which i kind of came up with
 

1065
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,990
this design which i kind of came up with
it's it it really it doesn't require

1066
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,000
it's it it really it doesn't require
 

1067
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,629
it's it it really it doesn't require
kind of infrastructure because

1068
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:20,639
kind of infrastructure because
 

1069
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,669
kind of infrastructure because
um

1070
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:21,679
um
 

1071
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,909
um
you can write smart contracts on bitcoin

1072
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:23,919
you can write smart contracts on bitcoin
 

1073
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:27,190
you can write smart contracts on bitcoin
actually it's it's kind of tricky but

1074
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,200
actually it's it's kind of tricky but
 

1075
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,710
actually it's it's kind of tricky but
this one

1076
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:28,720
this one
 

1077
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,710
this one
they call scripts yeah yeah

1078
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:30,720
they call scripts yeah yeah
 

1079
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,069
they call scripts yeah yeah
and this script which is which i'm

1080
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:34,079
and this script which is which i'm
 

1081
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,470
and this script which is which i'm
thinking about is kind of

1082
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:36,480
thinking about is kind of
 

1083
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,950
thinking about is kind of
it's not really so hard so it just

1084
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:38,960
it's not really so hard so it just
 

1085
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,909
it's not really so hard so it just
locked lock funds and and the

1086

uh all the bridges so they actually pass
pretty much the same stages so and down

1200
00:36:59,349 --> 00:36:59,359
pretty much the same stages so and down
 

1201
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,670
pretty much the same stages so and down
part uh which uh

1202
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:01,680
part uh which uh
 

1203
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,069
part uh which uh
really operates this in the sterilized

1204
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:04,079
really operates this in the sterilized
 

1205
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,470
really operates this in the sterilized
fashion without the necessity to

1206
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:08,480

actually
 

1213
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,510
actually
is the one of the last points so first

1214
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:17,520
is the one of the last points so first

you need to create the basic layer

1216
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:20,400
you need to create the basic layer
 

1217
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,230
you need to create the basic layer
learn how to transfer information from

1218
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:22,240
learn how to transfer information from
 

1219
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,750
learn how to transfer information from
one blockchain to another

1220
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:23,760
one blockchain to another
 

1221
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,870
one blockchain to another
and uh it's it's not that easy um

1222
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:26,880
and uh it's it's not that easy um
 

1223
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,310
and uh it's it's not that easy um
i would agree that

1224
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:28,320
i would agree that
 

1225
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,190
i would agree that
it it's a very easy so although we have

1226
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,200
it it's a very easy so although we have
 

1227
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,910
it it's a very easy so although we have
some uh some tool sets already developed

1228
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:33,920
some uh some tool sets already developed
 

1229
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,030
some uh some tool sets already developed
so we have at least two bridges uh with

1230
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,040
so we have at least two bridges uh with
 

1231
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,589
so we have at least two bridges uh with
two different concepts which are in some

1232
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:39,599
two different concepts which are in some
 

1233
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,990
two different concepts which are in some
fashion similar to each other and uh

1234
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:42,000
fashion similar to each other and uh
 

1235
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,270
fashion similar to each other and uh
differ depending on the other side

1236
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,280
differ depending on the other side
 

1237
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,390
differ depending on the other side
what's blockchain on the other side um

1238
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:48,400
what's blockchain on the other side um
 

1239
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,030
what's blockchain on the other side um
but mainly this is uh

1240
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,040
but mainly this is uh
 

1241
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,750
but mainly this is uh
this staging is done for a reason

1242
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:53,760
this staging is done for a reason
 

1243
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,069
this staging is done for a reason
and uh

1244
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:56,079
and uh
 

1245
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,870
and uh
if you want some capital to inflow from

1246
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:58,880
if you want some capital to inflow from
 

1247
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,030
if you want some capital to inflow from
from bitcoin uh through the bridge so

1248
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,040
from bitcoin uh through the bridge so
 

1249
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,550
from bitcoin uh through the bridge so
you must

1250
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:02,560
you must
 

1251
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,910
you must
assure this capital uh or capital owners

1252
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:05,920
assure this capital uh or capital owners
 

1253
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,310
assure this capital uh or capital owners
that this is safe first of all and this

1254
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:08,320
that this is safe first of all and this
 

1255
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,950
that this is safe first of all and this
is not not an easy part because uh we

1256
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:10,960
is not not an easy part because uh we
 

1257
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,790
is not not an easy part because uh we
have a lot of discussions with different

1258
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:12,800
have a lot of discussions with different
 

1259
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,630
have a lot of discussions with different
funds and uh

1260
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:14,640
funds and uh
 

1261
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,349
funds and uh
yeah it's it's always a very very tricky

1262
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:17,359
yeah it's it's always a very very tricky
 

1263
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,230
yeah it's it's always a very very tricky
tricky question so you need to prove

1264
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,240
tricky question so you need to prove
 

1265
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,109
tricky question so you need to prove
is it

1266
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:21,119
is it
 

1267
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,990
is it
tricky in technical terms like you need

1268
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:24,000
tricky in technical terms like you need
 

1269
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,790
tricky in technical terms like you need
to

1270
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:24,800
to
 

1271
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,270
to
like show a specification provide the

1272
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:27,280
like show a specification provide the
 

1273
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,710
like show a specification provide the
proof that uh absolutely yeah so big big

1274
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:30,720
proof that uh absolutely yeah so big big
 

1275
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,630
proof that uh absolutely yeah so big big
funds they they require it they have

1276
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:32,640
funds they they require it they have
 

1277
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,230
funds they they require it they have
their own

1278
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:34,240
their own
 

1279
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,310
their own
security guys who inspect

1280
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:36,320
security guys who inspect
 

1281
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,349
security guys who inspect
all this

1282
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:37,359
all this
 

1283
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,910
all this
audit results and

1284
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:39,920
audit results and
 

1285
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,550
audit results and
they want to look at the source code

1286
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:42,560
they want to look at the source code
 

1287
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,950
they want to look at the source code
and so on so forth to be sure that if

1288
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:44,960
and so on so forth to be sure that if
 

1289
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,710
and so on so forth to be sure that if
they would like to transfer i don't know

1290
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:46,720
they would like to transfer i don't know
 

1291
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,950
they would like to transfer i don't know
10 million bucks through the bridge so

1292
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:48,960
10 million bucks through the bridge so
 

1293
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,430
10 million bucks through the bridge so
it will be safe

1294
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:53,440

 

1295
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,349

yeah so and it will be interesting to

1296
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:55,359
yeah so and it will be interesting to
 

1297
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,750
yeah so and it will be interesting to
jump in the process but but maybe like a

1298
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:57,760
jump in the process but but maybe like a
 

1299
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,870
jump in the process but but maybe like a
little bit later i agree yeah

1300
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:00,880
little bit later i agree yeah
 

1301
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,990
little bit later i agree yeah
what i would do actually is try to

1302
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,000
what i would do actually is try to
 

1303
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,710
what i would do actually is try to
bring here some some representatives of

1304
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:06,720
bring here some some representatives of
 

1305
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,550
bring here some some representatives of
the bitcoin community um maybe from even

1306
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:10,560
the bitcoin community um maybe from even
 

1307
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,109
the bitcoin community um maybe from even
robbed vtc or nbtc

1308
00:39:13,109 --> 00:39:13,119
robbed vtc or nbtc
 

1309
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,390
robbed vtc or nbtc
projects uh who can maybe

1310
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:16,400
projects uh who can maybe
 

1311
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,150
projects uh who can maybe
tell us a bit more about how they

1312
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,160
tell us a bit more about how they
 

1313
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,230
tell us a bit more about how they
operate the bridges or what difficulty

1314
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,240
operate the bridges or what difficulty
 

1315
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,430
operate the bridges or what difficulty
experience

1316
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:21,440
experience
 

1317
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,150
experience
and so on and so forth and maybe uh

1318
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:24,160
and so on and so forth and maybe uh
 

1319
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,990
and so on and so forth and maybe uh
it is it will be a good move to

1320
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,000
it is it will be a good move to
 

1321
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,349
it is it will be a good move to
ask them

1322
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:29,359
ask them
 

1323
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,870
ask them
ask them

1324
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:30,880
ask them
 

1325
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,150
ask them
to to

1326
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,160
to to
 

1327
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,910
to to
to build the bridge to the freetown site

1328
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:33,920
to build the bridge to the freetown site
 

1329
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,990
to build the bridge to the freetown site
as well well because they already have

1330
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,000
as well well because they already have
 

1331
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,910
as well well because they already have
the bitcoin apart development they will

1332
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:37,920
the bitcoin apart development they will
 

1333
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,710
the bitcoin apart development they will
build they will build another like half

1334
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:40,720
build they will build another like half
 

1335
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,550
build they will build another like half
custody how half we see to any kind kind

1336
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:44,560
custody how half we see to any kind kind
 

1337
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,710
custody how half we see to any kind kind
of solution because the currently

1338
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:46,720
of solution because the currently
 

1339
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,750
of solution because the currently
probability is is kind of like

1340
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:49,760
probability is is kind of like
 

1341
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,150
probability is is kind of like
partially centralized

1342
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:52,160
partially centralized
 

1343
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,990
partially centralized
yeah i know all the drawbacks of of the

1344
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:54,000
yeah i know all the drawbacks of of the
 

1345
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,310
yeah i know all the drawbacks of of the
random tc model that most of the nodes

1346
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:56,320
random tc model that most of the nodes
 

1347
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,550
random tc model that most of the nodes
are controlled by the same company

1348
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:58,560
are controlled by the same company
 

1349
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,190
are controlled by the same company
and so on and so forth but uh

1350
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,200
and so on and so forth but uh
 

1351
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,310
and so on and so forth but uh
still

1352
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:02,320
still
 

1353
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,230
still
i think that it's better to start from

1354
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:04,240
i think that it's better to start from
 

1355
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,950
i think that it's better to start from
something that's already proven uh

1356
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:06,960
something that's already proven uh
 

1357
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,390
something that's already proven uh
on the market

1358
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:08,400
on the market
 

1359
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,150
on the market
and then to to do everything from

1360
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,160
and then to to do everything from
 

1361
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,349
and then to to do everything from
scratch

1362
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:11,359
scratch
 

1363
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,870
scratch
because uh

1364
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:14,880

 

1365
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,870

reinventing the wheel is not always that

1366
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:16,880
reinventing the wheel is not always that
 

1367
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,870
reinventing the wheel is not always that
was the best approach

1368
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:18,880
was the best approach
 

1369
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,030
was the best approach
well

1370
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,040
well
 

1371
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,230
well
i i i expect

1372
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:24,240
i i i expect
 

1373
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,390
i i i expect
yeah comments on that like if you if

1374
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:26,400
yeah comments on that like if you if
 

1375
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,790
yeah comments on that like if you if
your will is in there isn't that

1376
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:28,800
your will is in there isn't that
 

1377
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,710
your will is in there isn't that
like horsepower and

1378
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:30,720
like horsepower and
 

1379
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,109
like horsepower and
then you invented the car you better

1380
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:33,119
then you invented the car you better
 

1381
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,349
then you invented the car you better
change the wheel i mean

1382
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:35,359
change the wheel i mean
 

1383
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,230
change the wheel i mean
i mean that at least the bitcoin part uh

1384
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:38,240
i mean that at least the bitcoin part uh
 

1385
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,829
i mean that at least the bitcoin part uh
that they did

1386
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:39,839
that they did
 

1387
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,910
that they did
is a nice one

1388
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:41,920
is a nice one
 

1389
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,589
is a nice one
i don't mean

1390
00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:43,599
i don't mean
 

1391
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,190
i don't mean
yeah i don't mean that maybe you

1392
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,200
yeah i don't mean that maybe you
 

1393
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,309
yeah i don't mean that maybe you
understand

1394
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:46,319
understand
 

1395
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,470
understand
sorry maybe you technically understand

1396
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:48,480
sorry maybe you technically understand
 

1397
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,030
sorry maybe you technically understand
it but tvm kind of

1398
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,040
it but tvm kind of
 

1399
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,670
it but tvm kind of
storage model is based kind of on the on

1400
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:53,680
storage model is based kind of on the on
 

1401
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,990
storage model is based kind of on the on
three kind of data structure which

1402
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:56,000
three kind of data structure which
 

1403
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,510
three kind of data structure which
consists of like proofs

1404
00:40:59,510 --> 00:40:59,520
consists of like proofs
 

1405
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,109
consists of like proofs
right and

1406
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:01,119
right and
 

1407
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,630
right and
like you can build native native bitcoin

1408
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:04,640
like you can build native native bitcoin
 

1409
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,829
like you can build native native bitcoin
transaction layout from inside tvm back

1410
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:07,839
transaction layout from inside tvm back
 

1411
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,109

and forth
right

1414
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:11,200
right
 

1415
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,030
right
just need to know layout of bitcoin

1416
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,040
just need to know layout of bitcoin
 

1417
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,750
just need to know layout of bitcoin
transaction and and build the same thing

1418
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:15,760
transaction and and build the same thing
 

1419
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,710
transaction and and build the same thing
right inside tvm and parse that

1420
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:18,720
right inside tvm and parse that
 

1421
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,430
right inside tvm and parse that
like you that came from relay

1422
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:21,440
like you that came from relay
 

1423
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,309
like you that came from relay
right

1424
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:22,319
right
 

1425
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,069
right
not really

1426
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:24,079
not really
 

1427
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,430
not really
i don't think so

1428
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:25,440
i don't think so
 

1429
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,309
i don't think so
yeah because you you well you will need

1430
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:28,319
yeah because you you well you will need
 

1431
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,829
yeah because you you well you will need
you will need

1432
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:29,839
you will need
 

1433
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,109
you will need
um

1434
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:31,119
um
 

1435
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:31,910
um
like

1436
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:31,920
like
 

1437
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,670
like
all the

1438

first of all you will need all the
 

1441
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,630
first of all you will need all the
cryptography second of all you basically

00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:36,640
cryptography second of all you basically
 

1443
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,390
cryptography second of all you basically
will need to create to like you will

1444
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:38,400
will need to create to like you will
 

1445
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,630
will need to create to like you will
need to write a lite client

1446
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:40,640
need to write a lite client
 

1447
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,309
need to write a lite client
to bitcoin as a smart contract

1448
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:44,319
to bitcoin as a smart contract
 

1449
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,990
to bitcoin as a smart contract
well yes uh sh 8 25

1450
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,000
well yes uh sh 8 25
 

1451
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,109
well yes uh sh 8 25
whatever it is natively on tvm and on

1452
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:51,119
whatever it is natively on tvm and on
 

1453
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,910
whatever it is natively on tvm and on
bitcoin both like it like we don't have

1454
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:53,920
bitcoin both like it like we don't have
 

1455
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,230
bitcoin both like it like we don't have
to keep shock we don't have so we can

1456
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:56,240
to keep shock we don't have so we can
 

1457
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,309
to keep shock we don't have so we can
like repeat it on ethereum but we have

1458
00:41:58,309 --> 00:41:58,319
like repeat it on ethereum but we have
 

1459
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,030
like repeat it on ethereum but we have
like sha

1460
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,040
like sha
 

1461
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,829
like sha
we have hashing yeah but that's just

1462
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:03,839
we have hashing yeah but that's just
 

1463
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,750
we have hashing yeah but that's just
part of that right and medical proofs we

1464
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:05,760
part of that right and medical proofs we
 

1465
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,910
part of that right and medical proofs we
have them they are based basically on

1466
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:07,920
have them they are based basically on
 

1467
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,470
have them they are based basically on
passion

1468
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:10,480

 

1469
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,790

yeah i'm not sure like

1470
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:12,800
yeah i'm not sure like
 

1471
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,190
yeah i'm not sure like
if you can i'm not sure i'm not sure you

1472
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:15,200
if you can i'm not sure i'm not sure you
 

1473
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,470
if you can i'm not sure i'm not sure you
can

1474
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:16,480
can
 

1475
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,510
can
build the light client of ethereum on

1476
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:19,520
build the light client of ethereum on
 

1477
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,950
build the light client of ethereum on
using

1478
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:20,960
using
 

1479
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,870
using
uh bitcoin using

1480
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:22,880
uh bitcoin using
 

1481
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,470
uh bitcoin using
um

1482
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:24,480
um
 

1483
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,710
um
if you receive like if you receive well

1484
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:26,720
if you receive like if you receive well
 

1485
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,390
if you receive like if you receive well
first of all

1486
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:28,400
first of all
 

1487
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,910
first of all
first of all you will need to parse the

1488
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:29,920
first of all you will need to parse the
 

1489
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,910
first of all you will need to parse the
script right which is you will need to

1490
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:31,920
script right which is you will need to
 

1491
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,950
script right which is you will need to
emulate

1492
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:32,960
emulate
 

1493
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,030
emulate
the like the fourth

1494
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,040
the like the fourth
 

1495
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,430
the like the fourth
script language a little a little like

1496
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:37,440
script language a little a little like
 

1497
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,069
script language a little a little like
the interpretator i mean spv like build

1498
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:40,079
the interpretator i mean spv like build
 

1499
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:47,510
the interpretator i mean spv like build
built in spv

1500
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:47,520

 

1501
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,950

well again again you will need to parse

1502
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:48,960
well again again you will need to parse
 

1503
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,109
well again again you will need to parse
the script anyway whatever yes yes of

1504
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:51,119
the script anyway whatever yes yes of
 

1505
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,710
the script anyway whatever yes yes of
course so you will need to emulate the

1506
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:52,720
course so you will need to emulate the
 

1507
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,950
course so you will need to emulate the
script of the smart contract then then

1508
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:54,960
script of the smart contract then then
 

1509
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,510
script of the smart contract then then
you will need um

1510
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:57,520
you will need um
 

1511
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,710
you will need um
to

1512
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:58,720
to
 

1513
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,990
to
have a proof

1514
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,000
have a proof
 

1515
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,069
have a proof
right that the outputs that have been

1516
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:02,079
right that the outputs that have been
 

1517
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,430
right that the outputs that have been
sent to you are like the correct outputs

1518
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:05,440
sent to you are like the correct outputs
 

1519
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,750
sent to you are like the correct outputs
this is merkel prophet speaking on

1520
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:07,760
this is merkel prophet speaking on
 

1521
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,309
this is merkel prophet speaking on
how to like check the markup yes you

1522
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:10,319
how to like check the markup yes you
 

1523
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,670
how to like check the markup yes you
will need to check numerical proof

1524
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:11,680
will need to check numerical proof
 

1525
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,349
will need to check numerical proof
exactly like ethereum does that oh yeah

1526
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:13,359
exactly like ethereum does that oh yeah
 

1527
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,750
exactly like ethereum does that oh yeah
like bitcoin does that so yes

1528
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:15,760
like bitcoin does that so yes
 

1529
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,390
like bitcoin does that so yes
well if you you can do all that

1530
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:18,400
well if you you can do all that
 

1531
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,069
well if you you can do all that
but i'm not sure i'm not sure it's that

1532
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:20,079
but i'm not sure i'm not sure it's that
 

1533
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,150
but i'm not sure i'm not sure it's that
trivial like the fact that we have yeah

1534
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,160

like

1702
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:51,359
like
 

1703
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:54,230
like
we what we have is different from what

1704

we what we have is different from what
 

1705
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,550
we what we have is different from what
flex has for example and we we wanted to

flex has for example and we we wanted to
 

1707
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,230
flex has for example and we we wanted to
to talk to hear other opinions about uh

1708
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:02,240
to talk to hear other opinions about uh
 

1709
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:06,630
to talk to hear other opinions about uh
how other participants and how judges uh

1710
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:06,640
how other participants and how judges uh
 

1711
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,589
how other participants and how judges uh
here uh see the next

1712
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:09,599
here uh see the next
 

1713
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,349
here uh see the next
stage of the next the last stage of

1714
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:13,359
stage of the next the last stage of
 

1715
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,150
stage of the next the last stage of
dex implementation for sure it should be

1716
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:16,160
dex implementation for sure it should be
 

1717
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,430
dex implementation for sure it should be
about

1718
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:17,440
about
 

1719
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,630
about
interface

1720
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:18,640
interface
 

1721
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,390
interface
but what about the

1722
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:20,400
but what about the
 

1723
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,030
but what about the
the other parts because

1724
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:23,040
the other parts because
 

1725
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,750
the other parts because
we can offer what we see but maybe

1726
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:25,760
we can offer what we see but maybe
 

1727
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,870
we can offer what we see but maybe
somebody has any other opinions and uh

1728
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:28,880
somebody has any other opinions and uh
 

1729
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,510
somebody has any other opinions and uh
wants to announce it

1730
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:31,520
wants to announce it
 

1731
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,710
wants to announce it
okay thank you elena mita i think

1732
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:34,720
okay thank you elena mita i think
 

1733
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,549
okay thank you elena mita i think
the main thing is here is the question

1734
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:36,559
the main thing is here is the question
 

1735
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,470
the main thing is here is the question
to you so what will be the next stage

1736
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:38,480
to you so what will be the next stage
 

1737
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,470
to you so what will be the next stage
for the flex

1738
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:40,480
for the flex
 

1739
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,150
for the flex
for the flex well um we have we have

1740
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:44,160
for the flex well um we have we have
 

1741
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,069
for the flex well um we have we have
basically finished

1742
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:46,079
basically finished
 

1743
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,349
basically finished
um

1744
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:47,359
um
 

1745
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:48,470
um
we

1746
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:48,480
we
 

1747
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,190
we
so

1748
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:49,200
so
 

1749
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,309
so
like

1750
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:50,319
like
 

1751
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,710
like
the amm is there the complex mechanics i

1752
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:52,720
the amm is there the complex mechanics i
 

1753
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,710
the amm is there the complex mechanics i
don't know what it is but but

1754
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:54,720
don't know what it is but but
 

1755
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,549
don't know what it is but but
well our amm i think is is quite

1756
00:47:58,549 --> 00:47:58,559
well our amm i think is is quite
 

1757
00:47:58,559 --> 00:47:59,910
well our amm i think is is quite
quite fitting

1758
00:47:59,910 --> 00:47:59,920
quite fitting
 

1759
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,750
quite fitting
towards that like is it to the complex

1760
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:01,760
towards that like is it to the complex
 

1761
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,270
towards that like is it to the complex
mechanics because you can create as many

1762
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:03,280
mechanics because you can create as many
 

1763
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,910
mechanics because you can create as many
amms you as you want you can launch them

1764
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:05,920
amms you as you want you can launch them
 

1765
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,510
amms you as you want you can launch them
with your different you know governance

1766
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:07,520
with your different you know governance
 

1767
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,150
with your different you know governance
tokens connected to flex and and like

1768
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:10,160
tokens connected to flex and and like
 

1769
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,150
tokens connected to flex and and like
you would with normal order book kind of

1770
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:12,160
you would with normal order book kind of
 

1771
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,230
you would with normal order book kind of
exchanges so you can totally emulate the

1772
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:14,240
exchanges so you can totally emulate the
 

1773
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,390
exchanges so you can totally emulate the
whole work of the financial market uh as

1774
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:16,400
whole work of the financial market uh as
 

1775
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,230
whole work of the financial market uh as
it is today without

1776
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:18,240
it is today without
 

1777
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,630
it is today without
being stuck with the one amm which is

1778
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:20,640
being stuck with the one amm which is
 

1779
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,589
being stuck with the one amm which is
the same as basically the the exchange

1780
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:23,599
the same as basically the the exchange
 

1781
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:24,870
the same as basically the the exchange
so um

1782
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:24,880
so um
 

1783
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,030
so um
so that's about the mm i don't know what

1784
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:27,040
so that's about the mm i don't know what
 

1785
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,309
so that's about the mm i don't know what
else to add uh here

1786
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:30,319
else to add uh here
 

1787
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:31,990
else to add uh here
yeah again i have no connect i don't

1788
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:32,000
yeah again i have no connect i don't
 

1789
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,870
yeah again i have no connect i don't
know i i wasn't participating in the

1790
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:34,880
know i i wasn't participating in the
 

1791
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,870
know i i wasn't participating in the
contest formulation so i have no idea

1792
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:36,880
contest formulation so i have no idea
 

1793
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,950
contest formulation so i have no idea
what what it really means yeah i think

1794
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:38,960
what what it really means yeah i think
 

1795
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,990
what what it really means yeah i think
that's it's it's not about um we should

1796
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:42,000
that's it's it's not about um we should
 

1797
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,750
that's it's it's not about um we should
not stick to the

1798
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:43,760
not stick to the
 

1799
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,750
not stick to the
preliminary warnings that were in the

1800
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:45,760
preliminary warnings that were in the
 

1801
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,790
preliminary warnings that were in the
previous stages because it was not clear

1802
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:48,800
previous stages because it was not clear
 

1803
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,790
previous stages because it was not clear
absolutely where this contest will go

1804
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:50,800
absolutely where this contest will go
 

1805
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,750
absolutely where this contest will go
and uh what will appear uh

1806
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:53,760
and uh what will appear uh
 

1807
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,190
and uh what will appear uh
after it's finished

1808
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:55,200
after it's finished
 

1809
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,910
after it's finished
so as maybe i will try to reformulate

1810
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:57,920
so as maybe i will try to reformulate
 

1811
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,069
so as maybe i will try to reformulate
the question so um

1812
00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:00,079
the question so um
 

1813
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,630
the question so um
if for um

1814
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:02,640
if for um
 

1815
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,349
if for um
so

1816
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:03,359
so
 

1817
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:04,309
so
uh

1818
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:04,319
uh
 

1819
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,870
uh
now we have uh some working solutions

1820
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:06,880
now we have uh some working solutions
 

1821
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,750
now we have uh some working solutions
yeah so uh they are not ideal of course

1822
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:09,760
yeah so uh they are not ideal of course
 

1823
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,829
yeah so uh they are not ideal of course
but they uh they acquire quite decent

1824
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:11,839
but they uh they acquire quite decent
 

1825
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,510
but they uh they acquire quite decent
ones and uh

1826
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:13,520
ones and uh
 

1827
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,910
ones and uh
uh for the third stage

1828
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:15,920
uh for the third stage
 

1829
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,470
uh for the third stage
besides some interface improvements and

1830
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:18,480
besides some interface improvements and
 

1831
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,630
besides some interface improvements and
whatever so uh

1832
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:20,640
whatever so uh
 

1833
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,270
whatever so uh
we have two different models so the amm

1834
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:23,280
we have two different models so the amm
 

1835
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,630
we have two different models so the amm
based uh

1836
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:24,640
based uh
 

1837
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,549
based uh
exchanges and all the book based

1838
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:26,559
exchanges and all the book based
 

1839
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,470
exchanges and all the book based
exchange uh so what will be the uh

1840
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:30,480
exchange uh so what will be the uh
 

1841
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,030
exchange uh so what will be the uh
possible next stage for both types of

1842
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:33,040
possible next stage for both types of
 

1843
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,230
possible next stage for both types of
observers

1844
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:34,240
observers
 

1845
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,510
observers
well i think we need to i like it

1846
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:35,520
well i think we need to i like it
 

1847
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,670
well i think we need to i like it
doesn't matter uh in terms of like

1848
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:37,680
doesn't matter uh in terms of like
 

1849
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,910
doesn't matter uh in terms of like
amendments or not a mm because

1850
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:39,920
amendments or not a mm because
 

1851
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,069
amendments or not a mm because
both solutions provide at the end both

1852
00:49:42,069 --> 00:49:42,079
both solutions provide at the end both
 

1853
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,390
both solutions provide at the end both
solutions provide some user experience

1854
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:44,400
solutions provide some user experience
 

1855
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,150
solutions provide some user experience
and they should include the automatic

1856
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:46,160
and they should include the automatic
 

1857
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,069
and they should include the automatic
market maker so and both of them are

1858
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:50,079
market maker so and both of them are
 

1859
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,910
market maker so and both of them are
providing that

1860
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:51,920
providing that
 

1861
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,630
providing that
now

1862
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:52,640
now
 

1863
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,390
now
we for example in terms of interfaces

1864
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:54,400
we for example in terms of interfaces
 

1865
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,670
we for example in terms of interfaces
you should be careful because we are not

1866
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:55,680
you should be careful because we are not
 

1867
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,430
you should be careful because we are not
going to make a

1868
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:57,440
going to make a
 

1869
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,510
going to make a
standalone web interface because it goes

1870
00:49:59,510 --> 00:49:59,520
standalone web interface because it goes
 

1871
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,190
standalone web interface because it goes
against our ideology because it sucks

1872
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:03,200
against our ideology because it sucks
 

1873
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,630
against our ideology because it sucks

um if the solution is saying that you

1986
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:06,880
um if the solution is saying that you
 

1987
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,589
um if the solution is saying that you
can do that of course like i don't know

1988
00:52:09,589 --> 00:52:09,599
can do that of course like i don't know
 

1989

it should just say what kind of
 

2003
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,670
it should just say what kind of
usability it should have so for example

2004
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:23,680
usability it should have so for example
 

2005
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,270
usability it should have so for example
should it support like should the

2006

which are tradable there for example
 

2041
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,430
which are tradable there for example
taking the brox token and

2042
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:03,440
taking the brox token and
 

2043
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,109
taking the brox token and
adding that to the exchange as part of

2044
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:05,119
adding that to the exchange as part of
 

2045
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,030
adding that to the exchange as part of
the solution and the india and the rules

2046
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:07,040
the solution and the india and the rules
 

2047
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,030
the solution and the india and the rules
and creation of the amms or or whatever

2048
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:09,040
and creation of the amms or or whatever
 

2049
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,390
and creation of the amms or or whatever
governance tokens for your platform i

2050
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:10,400
governance tokens for your platform i
 

2051
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,630
governance tokens for your platform i
think that's it no no more i mean i

2052
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:12,640
think that's it no no more i mean i
 

2053
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,390
think that's it no no more i mean i
i don't know maybe i'm missing something

2054
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:14,400
i don't know maybe i'm missing something
 

2055
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,069
i don't know maybe i'm missing something
okay

2056
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:16,079
okay
 

2057
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,870
okay
so generally dao model uh implemented on

2058
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:18,880
so generally dao model uh implemented on
 

2059
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,950
so generally dao model uh implemented on
the next stage

2060
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:20,960
the next stage
 

2061
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,549
the next stage
and everything around user experience

2062
00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:22,559
and everything around user experience
 

2063
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,910
and everything around user experience
basically and

2064
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:23,920
basically and
 

2065
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,829
basically and
user experience and talking token owner

2066
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:26,839
user experience and talking token owner
 

2067
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:29,510
user experience and talking token owner
experience so things like that okay okay

2068
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:29,520
experience so things like that okay okay
 

2069
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:34,230
experience so things like that okay okay
thank you michael azor please

2070
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:34,240

 

2071
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,549

okay hear me now yep

2072
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:36,559
okay hear me now yep
 

2073
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,069
okay hear me now yep
okay yeah so

2074
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:38,079
okay yeah so
 

2075
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,829
okay yeah so
i guess for

2076
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:39,839
i guess for
 

2077
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,829
i guess for
well more complex mechanics that would

2078
00:53:41,829 --> 00:53:41,839
well more complex mechanics that would
 

2079
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:43,990
well more complex mechanics that would
probably include some something like

2080
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:44,000
probably include some something like
 

2081
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,109
probably include some something like
limit orders and uh

2082
00:53:47,109 --> 00:53:47,119
limit orders and uh
 

2083
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,470
limit orders and uh
something like

2084
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:48,480
something like
 

2085
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,030
something like
well slippage settings and different

2086
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:51,040
well slippage settings and different
 

2087
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,109
well slippage settings and different
settings to allow for

2088
00:53:53,109 --> 00:53:53,119
settings to allow for
 

2089
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:54,790
settings to allow for
a different

2090
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:54,800
a different
 

2091
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,430
a different
like market circumstances uh

2092
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:57,440
like market circumstances uh
 

2093
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,630
like market circumstances uh
to you

2094
00:53:58,630 --> 00:53:58,640
to you
 

2095
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,069
to you
to to allow

2096
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:00,079
to to allow
 

2097
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:04,069
to to allow
the decks and users uh stay

2098
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:04,079
the decks and users uh stay
 

2099
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,069
the decks and users uh stay
well um

2100
00:54:06,069 --> 00:54:06,079
well um
 

2101
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,069
well um
stay

2102
00:54:08,069 --> 00:54:08,079
stay
 

2103
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:08,829
stay
like

2104
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:08,839
like
 

2105
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:10,790
like
agile uh

2106
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:10,800
agile uh
 

2107
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,950
agile uh
regardless of the circumstances on the

2108
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:12,960
regardless of the circumstances on the
 

2109
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,190
regardless of the circumstances on the
market like pairs

2110
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:15,200
market like pairs
 

2111
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,910
market like pairs
so i guess more uh more power to the

2112
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:17,920
so i guess more uh more power to the
 

2113
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,349
so i guess more uh more power to the
users to

2114
00:54:19,349 --> 00:54:19,359
users to
 

2115
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,270
users to
to allow them to

2116
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:21,280
to allow them to
 

2117
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,309
to allow them to
uh

2118
00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:22,319
uh
 

2119
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,270
uh
to choose different settings and to uh

2120
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:25,280
to choose different settings and to uh
 

2121
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,030
to choose different settings and to uh
to perform um

2122
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:27,040
to perform um
 

2123
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,829
to perform um
operations with oh with more

2124
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:29,839
operations with oh with more
 

2125
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,510
operations with oh with more
different parameters i guess that's

2126
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:31,520
different parameters i guess that's
 

2127
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,510
different parameters i guess that's
that's more about

2128
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:33,520
that's more about
 

2129
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,390
that's more about
what

2130
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:34,400
what
 

2131
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,630
what
can be done in this

2132
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:36,640
can be done in this
 

2133
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,150
can be done in this
part of this contest i also wanted to uh

2134
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:40,160
part of this contest i also wanted to uh

developing such solutions and we talked

2216
00:55:59,670 --> 00:55:59,680
developing such solutions and we talked
 

2217
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,470
developing such solutions and we talked
about this many many times is that you

2218
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:02,480
about this many many times is that you
 

2219
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,309
about this many many times is that you
should operate your solution

2220
00:56:04,309 --> 00:56:04,319
should operate your solution
 

2221
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,349
should operate your solution
and

2222
00:56:05,349 --> 00:56:05,359
and
 

2223
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:06,390
and

your solution
 

2235
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,990
your solution
but uh

2236
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:18,000
but uh
 

2237
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,789
but uh
the defies of governance allocate some

2238
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:20,799
the defies of governance allocate some
 

2239
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,309
the defies of governance allocate some
budgets to help you build these

2247
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,670
costs
this is not not about the contest model

2248
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:31,680
this is not not about the contest model
 

2249
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,750
this is not not about the contest model
it's all this is not a grant system or

2250
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:33,760
it's all this is not a grant system or
 

2251
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,030
it's all this is not a grant system or
something like this

2252
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:35,040
something like this
 

2253
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,270
something like this
and uh

2254
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:37,280
and uh
 

2255
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,750
and uh
speaking about the amount of work uh

2256
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:39,760
speaking about the amount of work uh
 

2257
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,589
speaking about the amount of work uh
so there are some good points uh that

2258
00:56:43,589 --> 00:56:43,599
so there are some good points uh that
 

2259
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,789
so there are some good points uh that
you told and meter told so that need to

2260
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:46,799
you told and meter told so that need to
 

2261
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:50,230
you told and meter told so that need to
be you know some digested and uh

2262
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:50,240
be you know some digested and uh
 

2263
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,630
be you know some digested and uh
converted into the proposal for the

2264
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:52,640
converted into the proposal for the
 

2265
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,950
converted into the proposal for the
third stage of the contest maybe it will

2266
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:54,960
third stage of the contest maybe it will
 

2267
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,870
third stage of the contest maybe it will
be split into two stages if it if there

2268
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:56,880
be split into two stages if it if there
 

2269
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,069
be split into two stages if it if there
is a big number of features to be

2270
00:57:00,069 --> 00:57:00,079
is a big number of features to be
 

2271
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,230
is a big number of features to be
implemented on the stage for example

2272
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:02,240
implemented on the stage for example
 

2273
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,829
implemented on the stage for example
they know uh

2274
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:03,839
they know uh
 

2275
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:06,069
they know uh
the next stage is about dao model and

2276
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:06,079
the next stage is about dao model and
 

2277
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,870
the next stage is about dao model and
then about the user interfaces user

2278
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:08,880
then about the user interfaces user
 

2279
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,470
then about the user interfaces user
interaction and so on so on so forth uh

2280
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:12,480
interaction and so on so on so forth uh
 

2281
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,750
interaction and so on so on so forth uh
it we

2282
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:13,760
it we
 

2283
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,470
it we
really try to be fair here to when we

2284
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:16,480
really try to be fair here to when we
 

2285
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,150
really try to be fair here to when we
are estimating the

2286
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:18,160
are estimating the
 

2287
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,910
are estimating the
cost of the

2288
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:19,920
cost of the
 

2289
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,789
cost of the
rewards for for price places but it's

2290
00:57:22,789 --> 00:57:22,799
rewards for for price places but it's
 

2291
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,829
rewards for for price places but it's
not about you know covering your costs

2292
00:57:24,829 --> 00:57:24,839
not about you know covering your costs
 

2293
