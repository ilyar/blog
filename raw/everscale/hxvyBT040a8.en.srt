how uh their solidity forever scale
 

47
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,550
how uh their solidity forever scale
works actually and what's the difference

48
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
works actually and what's the difference
 

49
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,030
works actually and what's the difference
with the ethereum one for example

50
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
with the ethereum one for example
 

51
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,310

everscale network um
 

115
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,390
everscale network um
this is a blockchain of the fifth

116
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
this is a blockchain of the fifth
 

117
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,670
this is a blockchain of the fifth
generation

118
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:33,680
generation
 

119
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,110
generation
uh which was developed uh

120
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
uh which was developed uh
 

121
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,949
uh which was developed uh
more than two years ago

122
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
more than two years ago
 

123
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,390
more than two years ago
with um

124

with um
 

125
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,070
with um
oppa uh it's not working

126
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080

 

127
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,270

um
 

129
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,430
um
yeah so it was developed uh more than

130
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
yeah so it was developed uh more than
 

131
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,949
yeah so it was developed uh more than
two years ago uh by a group of

132
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:50,959
two years ago uh by a group of
 

133
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,990
two years ago uh by a group of
institutionals who decided to create a

134
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
institutionals who decided to create a
 

135
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,670
institutionals who decided to create a
network a blockchain that really uh is

136
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680
network a blockchain that really uh is
 

137
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,830
network a blockchain that really uh is
able to face the difficulties that

138
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
able to face the difficulties that
 

139
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,190
able to face the difficulties that
appear in

140
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
appear in
 

141
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,910
appear in
nowadays especially you all remember all

142
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:03,920
nowadays especially you all remember all
 

143
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,190
nowadays especially you all remember all
these cases with ethereum with solana so

144
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
these cases with ethereum with solana so
 

145
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,149
these cases with ethereum with solana so
when uh even a few applications a few

146
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
when uh even a few applications a few
 

147
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,309
when uh even a few applications a few
high load applications could stall the

148
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
high load applications could stall the
 

149
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,630
high load applications could stall the
whole network so and um

150
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
whole network so and um
 

151
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,190
whole network so and um
those uh initial members of the network

152
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
those uh initial members of the network
 

153
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,630
those uh initial members of the network
so they did tremendous work uh to polish

154
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
so they did tremendous work uh to polish
 

155
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,509
so they did tremendous work uh to polish
everything and build the most scalable

156
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
everything and build the most scalable
 

157
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,110
everything and build the most scalable
network to date so for now so it's uh

158
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
network to date so for now so it's uh
 

159
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,589
network to date so for now so it's uh
the fastest uh i'm not afraid of saying

160
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
the fastest uh i'm not afraid of saying
 

161
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,789
the fastest uh i'm not afraid of saying
this the fastest network uh to date

162
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
this the fastest network uh to date
 

163
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,470
this the fastest network uh to date
uh so

164
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
uh so
 

165
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,470
uh so
uh we have made a really sorrow test uh

166
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
uh we have made a really sorrow test uh
 

167
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,630
uh we have made a really sorrow test uh
the real-time test uh on the network

168
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
the real-time test uh on the network
 

169
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,270
the real-time test uh on the network
last year so where we had 400 validators

170
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
last year so where we had 400 validators
 

171
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,149
last year so where we had 400 validators

different slashing mechanisms and and so
 

175
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,630
different slashing mechanisms and and so
on and so forth so and we managed to

176
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
on and so forth so and we managed to
 

177
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,309

extremely cheap and
 

223
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,189
extremely cheap and
it will be even cheaper in future thanks

can be extremely big and also each work
 

253
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,909
can be extremely big and also each work
chain can also chart in almost

application in the world that will
 

269
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,749
application in the world that will
require such such workloads but

270
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:45,759
require such such workloads but
 

271
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,629
require such such workloads but
uh even theoretically so we can uh

272
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
uh even theoretically so we can uh
 

273
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,550
uh even theoretically so we can uh
reach the uh throughput of 1 million tps

274
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
reach the uh throughput of 1 million tps
 

275
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,909
reach the uh throughput of 1 million tps
and

276
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919
and
 

277
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,070
and
thanks to everscale architecture so it

278
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
thanks to everscale architecture so it
 

279
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,550
thanks to everscale architecture so it
can scale the workload linearly so

280
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
can scale the workload linearly so
 

281
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,029
can scale the workload linearly so
meaning that if you add more throughput

282
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
meaning that if you add more throughput
 

283
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,430
meaning that if you add more throughput
you just add new validators and the

284
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
you just add new validators and the
 

285
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,350
you just add new validators and the
network starts working more and more

286
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
network starts working more and more
 

287
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,790
network starts working more and more
productive

288
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
productive
 

289
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,469
productive
um and also of course so uh as soon as

290
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
um and also of course so uh as soon as
 

291
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,629
um and also of course so uh as soon as
network uh splits so uh it means that uh

292
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
network uh splits so uh it means that uh
 

293
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,350
network uh splits so uh it means that uh
each heart operates independently until

294
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
each heart operates independently until
 

295
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,150
each heart operates independently until
it's merged back and even if anything

296
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
it's merged back and even if anything
 

297
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,710
it's merged back and even if anything
goes wrong with one specific shards the

298
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
goes wrong with one specific shards the
 

299
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,029
goes wrong with one specific shards the
all the smart contracts deployed in

00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
all the smart contracts deployed in
 

301
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,430
all the smart contracts deployed in
other charts they can easily continue to

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
other charts they can easily continue to
 

303
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,909
other charts they can easily continue to

305
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,270

everscale uses the bft

306
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280
everscale uses the bft
 

307
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,230
everscale uses the bft

now so and we plan to migrate to even

310
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
now so and we plan to migrate to even
 

311
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,830
now so and we plan to migrate to even

uh advanced uh

314
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
uh advanced uh

soft majority uh fault tolerant

316
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
soft majority uh fault tolerant
 

317
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,270
soft majority uh fault tolerant
pos consensus soon so currently uh the

318
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
pos consensus soon so currently uh the
 

319
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,029
pos consensus soon so currently uh the
new upgrade for node software has been

320
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
new upgrade for node software has been
 

321
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,710
new upgrade for node software has been
developed in this very moment and

322
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
developed in this very moment and
 

323
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,870
developed in this very moment and
hopefully we will see it within a couple

324
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
hopefully we will see it within a couple
 

325
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,070
hopefully we will see it within a couple
of months

326
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
of months
 

327
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,550
of months
and it will give us even more stability

328
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
and it will give us even more stability
 

329
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,790
and it will give us even more stability
and the possibility to scale the network

330
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
and the possibility to scale the network
 

331
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,950
and the possibility to scale the network
even more

332
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
even more
 

333
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,230
even more
and

334
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
and
 

335
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,309
and
actually how the network works it works

336
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
actually how the network works it works
 

337
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,230
actually how the network works it works
is that you have independent validators

338
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,240
is that you have independent validators
 

339
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,950
is that you have independent validators
so anyone can raise this validator he

340
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
so anyone can raise this validator he
 

341
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,870
so anyone can raise this validator he
just needs to ensure that there is a

00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,520
you just need to provide the minimum
 

367
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,430
you just need to provide the minimum
stake for your validator and all the

stake for your validator and all the
 

369
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,790

yeah so actually with our efforts uh on
 

389
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,469
yeah so actually with our efforts uh on
promoting our scale also in asian

390
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
promoting our scale also in asian
 

391
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,950
promoting our scale also in asian
markets especially in on the middle east

392
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960

we are seeing a lot of newcomers a lot
 

395
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,749
we are seeing a lot of newcomers a lot
of new validators uh coming into the

396
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:21,759
of new validators uh coming into the
 

397
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,909
of new validators uh coming into the

00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919
network so
 

399
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,790
network so
hopefully so uh we will see a lot of new

400
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
hopefully so uh we will see a lot of new
 

401
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,790
hopefully so uh we will see a lot of new

we have focused on doing since the very
 

409
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,589
we have focused on doing since the very
start of the network is to make it very

410
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
start of the network is to make it very
 

411
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,509
start of the network is to make it very
well connected to all other existing

well connected to all other existing
 

413
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,509
well connected to all other existing

the network uh so we
uh

514
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
uh
 

515
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,470
uh
come into a new record on the network of

516
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
come into a new record on the network of
 

517
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,910
come into a new record on the network of
800 000 uh accounts live accounts that

518
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
800 000 uh accounts live accounts that
 

519
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,710
800 000 uh accounts live accounts that
are working on the network and uh

520
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,720
are working on the network and uh
 

521
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,069
are working on the network and uh
i just posted uh the previous record of

522
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:44,079
i just posted uh the previous record of
 

523
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,630
i just posted uh the previous record of
750

524
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:46,640
750
 

525
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,590
750
maybe a one or so week ago so you see we

526
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
maybe a one or so week ago so you see we
 

527
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,829
maybe a one or so week ago so you see we
are almost uh grown by additional 40 000

528
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
are almost uh grown by additional 40 000
 

529
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,389
are almost uh grown by additional 40 000
and hopefully we will reach 800 000 by

530
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
and hopefully we will reach 800 000 by
 

531
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,470
and hopefully we will reach 800 000 by
end of next week

532
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
end of next week
 

533
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,269
end of next week
there are uh 38 million of ordinary

534
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
there are uh 38 million of ordinary
 

535
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,110
there are uh 38 million of ordinary
transactions so i'm specifically

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
transactions so i'm specifically
 

537
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,710
transactions so i'm specifically
indicating this because these are

538
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
indicating this because these are
 

539
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,110
indicating this because these are
transactions created by the uh smart

540
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
transactions created by the uh smart
 

541
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,310
transactions created by the uh smart
contracts and by users who are doing the

542
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,320

doing they think on in different games
 

547
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,829
doing they think on in different games
uh because there are a lot of also

548
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
uh because there are a lot of also
 

549
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,590
uh because there are a lot of also
ordinary uh

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,269
ordinary uh
service transactions like tick tock

552
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
service transactions like tick tock
 

553
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,870
service transactions like tick tock
transactions that are

transactions that are
 

555
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,790
transactions that are
helping contracts to function and if we

556
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
helping contracts to function and if we
 

557
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,310
helping contracts to function and if we
count those so it will be uh over 120

558
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
count those so it will be uh over 120
 

559

uh reached on the network
 

563
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,150
uh reached on the network
uh as i said more than 200 uh validators

a lot of cool stuff going on on
 

587
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,269
a lot of cool stuff going on on
our celebrations

588
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
our celebrations
 

589
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,470
our celebrations
and

590
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
and
 

591
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,629
and
what i have said so the transaction cost

592
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
what i have said so the transaction cost
 

593
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,990
what i have said so the transaction cost
for

594
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,000
for
 

595
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,829
for
running anything on everscale is

596
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
running anything on everscale is
 

597
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,269
running anything on everscale is
extremely small so even now so you can

598
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
extremely small so even now so you can
 

599
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,110
extremely small so even now so you can
see that the ordinary transaction costs

600
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,120
see that the ordinary transaction costs
 

601
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,430
see that the ordinary transaction costs
you less than 1000

602
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
you less than 1000
 

603
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,310
you less than 1000
of dollar

604
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320

 

605
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,269

so

606
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
so
 

607
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,350
so
speaking about the features i mostly

608
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
speaking about the features i mostly
 

609
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,670
speaking about the features i mostly
covered all of them so just

610
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
covered all of them so just
 

611
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,910
covered all of them so just
let's move further

612
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
let's move further
 

613
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,150
let's move further
um

614
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
um
 

615
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,389
um
as i said our scale has appeared as an

616
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
as i said our scale has appeared as an
 

617
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,509
as i said our scale has appeared as an
answer to the existence problems of the

618
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
answer to the existence problems of the
 

619
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,190
answer to the existence problems of the
blockchain and of uh the web3 in general

620
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
blockchain and of uh the web3 in general
 

621
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,750
blockchain and of uh the web3 in general
so because we have seen a dramatic

622
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
so because we have seen a dramatic
 

623
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,949
so because we have seen a dramatic
growth of interest in

624
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
growth of interest in
 

625
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,550
growth of interest in
blockchain development on different

626
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560
blockchain development on different
 

627
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,190
blockchain development on different
networks but unfortunately uh

628
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
networks but unfortunately uh
 

629
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,430
networks but unfortunately uh
you remember so there is something like

630
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
you remember so there is something like
 

631
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,389
you remember so there is something like
uh

632
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
uh
 

633
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,509
uh
post ethereum uh distress

634
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519

screen shown um a lot of people have

638
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
screen shown um a lot of people have
 

639
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,750
screen shown um a lot of people have
suffered from the high commissions and

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,760
suffered from the high commissions and
 

641
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,430
suffered from the high commissions and
it was almost impossible to use the

642
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
it was almost impossible to use the
 

643
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,389
it was almost impossible to use the
network and uh a lot of developers have

644
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
network and uh a lot of developers have
 

645
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,790
network and uh a lot of developers have
started thinking about moving to some

646
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
started thinking about moving to some
 

647
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,190
started thinking about moving to some
layer 2 solutions

648
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,200
layer 2 solutions
 

649
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,710
layer 2 solutions
or maybe to some

650
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
or maybe to some
 

651
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,269
or maybe to some
new new networks but

652
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:27,279
new new networks but
 

653
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,870
new new networks but
the main problem that we have seen is

654
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880
the main problem that we have seen is
 

655
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,389
the main problem that we have seen is
that lots of

656
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
that lots of
 

657
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,509
that lots of
existing

658
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:31,519

660
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:33,279
blockchain projects
 

661
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,910
blockchain projects
have started pretty much typically like

662
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
have started pretty much typically like
 

663
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,030
have started pretty much typically like
um

664
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,040
um
 

665
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,949
um
any other startups also they gathered

666
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
any other startups also they gathered
 

667
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,629
any other startups also they gathered
the money so they started aggressive

668
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
the money so they started aggressive
 

669
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,269
the money so they started aggressive
marketing promising a lot but in the end

670
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:43,279
marketing promising a lot but in the end
 

671
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,350
marketing promising a lot but in the end
uh the technology is really struggling

672
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,360
uh the technology is really struggling
 

673
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,509
uh the technology is really struggling
to follow their promises

674
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
to follow their promises
 

675
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,509
to follow their promises
and uh on everscale actually we

676
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
and uh on everscale actually we
 

677
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,629
and uh on everscale actually we
preach

678
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
preach
 

679
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,949
preach
a different approach and uh we first

680
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
a different approach and uh we first
 

681
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,389
a different approach and uh we first
build and promote

um now let's speak a bit about the
 

705
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,310
um now let's speak a bit about the
ecosystem so what's going on actually so

who who are all these people who are
actually on their scale uh this is this

710
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
actually on their scale uh this is this
 

711
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,870
actually on their scale uh this is this
terrible slide just to show you um

terrible slide just to show you um
 

713
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,350
terrible slide just to show you um
a bit of a small piece of ecosystem

714
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
a bit of a small piece of ecosystem
 

715
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,590
a bit of a small piece of ecosystem
actually the major project so they're

716
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
actually the major project so they're
 

717
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,590
actually the major project so they're
quite a number but

ago so uh
 

907
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,990
ago so uh
made the decentralized governance real

908
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,000
made the decentralized governance real
 

909
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,950
made the decentralized governance real
so uh for now we have uh more than 80 of

the network that has passed uh some a
 

917
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,110
the network that has passed uh some a
number of them that has not passed so

918
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
number of them that has not passed so
 

919
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,669
number of them that has not passed so
and uh in order to vote or never doubt

920
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
and uh in order to vote or never doubt
 

921
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,350
and uh in order to vote or never doubt
so you actually need to lock a certain

922
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
so you actually need to lock a certain
 

923
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,310
so you actually need to lock a certain
stake that will be equal to the number

924
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
stake that will be equal to the number
 

925
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,430
stake that will be equal to the number
of your votes and that uh lets you as a

00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:49,440
of your votes and that uh lets you as a
 

927
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,350
of your votes and that uh lets you as a
community member even if you have a

928
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,360
community member even if you have a
 

929
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,830
community member even if you have a
minor stake but you can also

930
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840
minor stake but you can also
 

931
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,710
minor stake but you can also
express your opinion and also affect

solution on certain proposal
 

937
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,070
solution on certain proposal
uh in future so what we are planning to

938
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,080
uh in future so what we are planning to
 

939
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,150
uh in future so what we are planning to
do is um

940
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,160
do is um
 

941
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,669
do is um
create a liquid staking protocol that

942
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:07,679
create a liquid staking protocol that
 

943
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,870
create a liquid staking protocol that
will allow you

944
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:10,880

 

945
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,110

to

946
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:12,120
to
 

947
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,110
to
simultaneously uh stake your uh

948
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,120
simultaneously uh stake your uh
 

949
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,990
simultaneously uh stake your uh
errors within the pools so getting some

950
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
errors within the pools so getting some
 

951
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,830
errors within the pools so getting some
rewards for it so money will be working

952
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
rewards for it so money will be working
 

953
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,430
rewards for it so money will be working
for for you

954
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:21,440
for for you
 

955
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,110
for for you
and at the same time the tokens that you

956
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
and at the same time the tokens that you
 

957
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,789
and at the same time the tokens that you
will get in return so of course they

958
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:24,799
will get in return so of course they
 

959
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,510
will get in return so of course they
will have also some additional value and

960
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,520
will have also some additional value and
 

961
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,510
will have also some additional value and
uh one of the features will be the

962
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
uh one of the features will be the
 

963
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,870
uh one of the features will be the
opportunity to vote on everdel so and

964
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
opportunity to vote on everdel so and
 

965
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,190
opportunity to vote on everdel so and
this will radically increase uh the

966
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,200
this will radically increase uh the
 

967
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,950
this will radically increase uh the
amount staked

968
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:36,960
amount staked
 

969
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,310
amount staked
in this protocol

970
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320

 

971
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,390

by the way it's already open source so

972
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:42,400
by the way it's already open source so
 

973
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,630
by the way it's already open source so
we have published in open source just

974
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640
we have published in open source just
 

975
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,990
we have published in open source just
recently so

976
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,000
recently so
 

977
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,230
recently so
didn't update the presentation

978
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,240
didn't update the presentation
 

979
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,070
didn't update the presentation
uh next we have a lot of excellent

980
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
uh next we have a lot of excellent
 

981
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,350
uh next we have a lot of excellent
connectivity tools for development

982
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,360
connectivity tools for development
 

983
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,430
connectivity tools for development
of web applications and

984
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:57,440
of web applications and
 

985
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,150
of web applications and
standalone applications

986
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,160
standalone applications
 

987
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,230
standalone applications
you have a constellation of different

988
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:02,240
you have a constellation of different
 

989
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,470
you have a constellation of different
wallets that support

990
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:04,480
wallets that support
 

991
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,029
wallets that support
in a bit different way uh

992
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:07,039
in a bit different way uh
 

993
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,190
in a bit different way uh
but all of them generally provide you

994
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,200
but all of them generally provide you
 

995
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,950
but all of them generally provide you
with opportunity to easily connect to

996
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:10,960
with opportunity to easily connect to
 

997
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,870
with opportunity to easily connect to
the network uh using uh the approach

998
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:14,880
the network uh using uh the approach
 

999
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,590
the network uh using uh the approach
pretty similar to like uh

1000
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:17,600
pretty similar to like uh
 

1001
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,590
pretty similar to like uh
a web3 of metamask does

1002
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:21,600
a web3 of metamask does
 

1003
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,149
a web3 of metamask does
yeah you can do a lot with this thing

1004
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:24,159
yeah you can do a lot with this thing
 

1005
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,310
yeah you can do a lot with this thing
you can send different payloads you can

1006
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,320
you can send different payloads you can
 

1007
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,029
you can send different payloads you can
call contracts you can deploy anything

1008
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:29,039
call contracts you can deploy anything
 

1009
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,230
call contracts you can deploy anything
so

1010
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,240
so
 

1011
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,590
so
quite a lot of stuff can be done with

1012
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:31,600
quite a lot of stuff can be done with
 

1013
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,510
quite a lot of stuff can be done with
this

1014
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
this
 

1015
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,590
this
about the breach so uh

1016
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:35,600
about the breach so uh
 

1017
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,750
about the breach so uh
we will talk a bit uh later so it's not

1018
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:37,760
we will talk a bit uh later so it's not
 

1019
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,270
we will talk a bit uh later so it's not
only october's bridge that exists on the

1020
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,280
only october's bridge that exists on the
 

1021
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,070
only october's bridge that exists on the
network so we have a lot of uh well a

1022
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,080
network so we have a lot of uh well a
 

1023
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,909
network so we have a lot of uh well a
number of uh other bridges that are

1024
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:43,919
number of uh other bridges that are
 

1025
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,390
number of uh other bridges that are
currently in an experimental stage and

1026
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:46,400
currently in an experimental stage and
 

1027
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,270
currently in an experimental stage and
uh

1028
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
uh
 

1029
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,669
uh
they are being developed also to target

1030
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:49,679
they are being developed also to target
 

1031
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,230
they are being developed also to target
specific networks like tezus or cardano

1032
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,240
specific networks like tezus or cardano
 

1033
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,950
specific networks like tezus or cardano
and uh those networks uh

1034
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:54,960
and uh those networks uh
 

1035
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,549
and uh those networks uh
and teams from those networks will soon

1036
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:56,559
and teams from those networks will soon
 

1037
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,630
and teams from those networks will soon
be able also to

1038
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:58,640
be able also to
 

1039
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,870
be able also to
join the everscale community

1040
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:02,880
join the everscale community
 

1041
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,669

next we have uh at least

1042
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:05,679
next we have uh at least
 

1043
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,870
next we have uh at least
four or five dexes existing on our scale

1044
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:08,880
four or five dexes existing on our scale
 

1045
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,549
four or five dexes existing on our scale
so the largest one is a flat cube

1046
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:10,559
so the largest one is a flat cube
 

1047
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,669
so the largest one is a flat cube
developed by bruxus but also we have the

flex developed by everex team so it is

1050
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,520
flex developed by everex team so it is
 

1051
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,590
flex developed by everex team so it is
the order book based uh

1052
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:19,600
the order book based uh
 

1053
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,270

um we have launched uh

1126
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,400
um we have launched uh
 

1127
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,430
um we have launched uh
two or three months ago the uh official

launch pad for

1130
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:00,880
launch pad for
 

1131
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,350
launch pad for
everscale it's called everstart that

1132
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,360
everscale it's called everstart that
 

1133
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,750
everscale it's called everstart that
allows you to

1134
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:05,760
allows you to
 

1135
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,310
allows you to
launch your product and also collect

launch your product and also collect
 

1137
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,710
launch your product and also collect
some initial funding

1138
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:10,720
some initial funding
 

1139
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,990
some initial funding
for now it works in a semi-moderated uh

1140
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,000
for now it works in a semi-moderated uh
 

1141
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,310
for now it works in a semi-moderated uh
way but later it will migrate to dao

1142
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:16,320
way but later it will migrate to dao
 

1143
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,830
way but later it will migrate to dao
based approach and

1144
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:19,840
based approach and
 

1145
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,669
based approach and
decisions on which projects to list are

1146
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:21,679
decisions on which projects to list are
 

1147
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,350
decisions on which projects to list are
never down or not so will be taken

1148
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,360
never down or not so will be taken
 

1149
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,230
never down or not so will be taken
through them so already uh five projects

1150
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,240
through them so already uh five projects
 

1151
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,270
through them so already uh five projects
has launched on the uh ever start so

1152
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,280
has launched on the uh ever start so
 

1153
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,510
has launched on the uh ever start so
it's it's a small number but uh it's a

1154
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,520
it's it's a small number but uh it's a
 

1155
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,350
it's it's a small number but uh it's a
beginning humble beginning

1156
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,360
beginning humble beginning
 

1157
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,870
beginning humble beginning
and uh so we expect really a lot a lot

1158
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
and uh so we expect really a lot a lot
 

1159
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,310
and uh so we expect really a lot a lot
of newcomers to launch soon

1160
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,320
of newcomers to launch soon
 

1161
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,590
of newcomers to launch soon
uh

1162
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:41,600
uh
 

1163
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,789
uh
uh also uh everscale is not only about a

1164
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:44,799
uh also uh everscale is not only about a
 

1165
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,870
uh also uh everscale is not only about a
crypto and nft so it's important to

1166
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:46,880
crypto and nft so it's important to
 

1167
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,430
crypto and nft so it's important to
understand that this network can really

1168
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:49,440
understand that this network can really
 

1169
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,310
understand that this network can really
withstand the workloads of the

1170
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,320
withstand the workloads of the
 

1171
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,110
withstand the workloads of the
traditionality businesses and one of the

1172
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,120
traditionality businesses and one of the
 

1173
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,070
traditionality businesses and one of the
applications that we are currently

1174
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,080
applications that we are currently
 

1175
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,190
applications that we are currently
negotiating actively with different

1176
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200
negotiating actively with different
 

1177
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,590
negotiating actively with different
countries is the deployment of different

scale which includes not only the

1182
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,080
scale which includes not only the
 

1183
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,310
scale which includes not only the
currency function but it also includes a

1184
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
currency function but it also includes a
 

1185
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,070
currency function but it also includes a
lot of security controls a lot of

1186
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,080
lot of security controls a lot of
 

1187
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,310
lot of security controls a lot of
permissioning and so on so forth

1188
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:14,320
permissioning and so on so forth
 

1189
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,669
permissioning and so on so forth
and uh

1190
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:15,679
and uh
 

1191
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,029
and uh
everscale is capable of fitting

1192
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:19,039
everscale is capable of fitting
 

1193
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,870
everscale is capable of fitting
with a needs actually because you can

1194
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:20,880
with a needs actually because you can
 

1195
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,549
with a needs actually because you can
imagine the amount of transactions that

1196
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:22,559
imagine the amount of transactions that
 

1197
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,710
imagine the amount of transactions that
are done in the real world with the fiat

1198
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720
are done in the real world with the fiat
 

1199
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,630
are done in the real world with the fiat
money so just

1200
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
money so just
 

1201
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,190
money so just
only visa generate something like 20

1202
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
only visa generate something like 20
 

1203
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,269
only visa generate something like 20
ktps on average

1204
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:31,279
ktps on average
 

1205
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,070
ktps on average
with a big one it was something like 55

1206
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,080
with a big one it was something like 55
 

1207
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,350
with a big one it was something like 55
even wrong

1208
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:35,360
even wrong
 

1209
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,630
even wrong
during some world championship

1210
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:36,640
during some world championship
 

1211
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,990
during some world championship
championship

1212
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,000
championship
 

1213
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,510
championship
and uh so actually visa can wholly fit

1214
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:41,520
and uh so actually visa can wholly fit
 

1215
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,750
and uh so actually visa can wholly fit
within every scale now

1216
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:43,760
within every scale now
 

1217
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,870
within every scale now
uh yeah so there are some some features

1218
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:46,880
uh yeah so there are some some features
 

1219
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,269
uh yeah so there are some some features
that already exist in every scale that

1220
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:49,279
that already exist in every scale that
 

1221
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,750
that already exist in every scale that
are capable of

1222
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:51,760
are capable of
 

1223
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,110
are capable of
and useful for cbdc deployment

1224
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,120
and useful for cbdc deployment
 

1225
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,110
and useful for cbdc deployment
um

1226
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,120
um
 

1227
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,430
um
let's speak about the community and

1228
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
let's speak about the community and
 

1229
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,110

scale so actually

1232
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:02,880
scale so actually
 

1233
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,029
scale so actually
we have started as a company from the

1234
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:05,039
we have started as a company from the
 

1235
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,269
we have started as a company from the
eastern europe and of course the

1236

eastern europe and of course the
 

1237
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,029
eastern europe and of course the
majority of the community initially was

1238
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:09,039
majority of the community initially was
 

1239
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,390
majority of the community initially was
from there

1240
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:10,400
from there
 

1241
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,190

still not very big so and the majority
 

1295
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,310
still not very big so and the majority
of communities are coming to the

1296

the next one is everex uh who which is a

1342
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:07,760
the next one is everex uh who which is a
 

1343
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,909
the next one is everex uh who which is a
company who initially developed all the

this is something that's uh
 

1349
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,230
this is something that's uh

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,549
network so uh who will bring a lot of
value and you can see also that we have

1518
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:38,559
value and you can see also that we have
 

1519
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,470
value and you can see also that we have
selected people uh from different

1520
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:40,480
selected people uh from different
 

1521
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,870
selected people uh from different
regions to better represent our scale in

1522
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:42,880
regions to better represent our scale in
 

1523
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,350
regions to better represent our scale in
them so we have people from europe from

1524
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,360
them so we have people from europe from
 

1525
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,389
them so we have people from europe from
north america from latim from asia uh

1526
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:48,399
north america from latim from asia uh
 

1527
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,269
north america from latim from asia uh
from from middle east uh

1528
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:51,279
from from middle east uh
 

1529
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,470
from from middle east uh
so those guys uh i actively uh

1530
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:54,480
so those guys uh i actively uh
 

1531
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,389
so those guys uh i actively uh
promote another scale now

1532
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:56,399
promote another scale now
 

1533
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,710
promote another scale now
within big uh funds and big investors uh

1534
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:00,720
within big uh funds and big investors uh
 

1535
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,029

explaining directly the benefits of

1536
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:03,039
explaining directly the benefits of
 

1537
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,470
explaining directly the benefits of
error scale to

1538
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:04,480
error scale to
 

1539
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,110
error scale to
to countries to governments and so on so

1540
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,120
to countries to governments and so on so
 

1541
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,389
to countries to governments and so on so
forth so and

1542
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:08,399
forth so and
 

1543
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,070
forth so and
definitely you will see them

1544
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,080
definitely you will see them
 

1545
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,870
definitely you will see them
uh

1546
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:10,880
uh
 

1547
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,430
uh
much more later

1548
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:13,440
much more later
 

1549
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,389
much more later
uh

1550
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:14,399
uh
 

1551
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,470
uh
a few words about the roadmaps of what

1552
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:16,480
a few words about the roadmaps of what
 

1553
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,350
a few words about the roadmaps of what
actually everscale uh we'll be doing the

1554
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,360
actually everscale uh we'll be doing the
 

1555
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,269
actually everscale uh we'll be doing the
in the nearest future so we are right

1556
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:21,279
in the nearest future so we are right
 

1557
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,230
in the nearest future so we are right
now here so you see that uh

1558
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:24,240
now here so you see that uh
 

1559
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,549
now here so you see that uh
here are some major points that we have

1560
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:26,559
here are some major points that we have
 

1561
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,430
here are some major points that we have
done but quite a lot is to be done yet

1562
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:29,440
done but quite a lot is to be done yet
 

1563
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,630
done but quite a lot is to be done yet
so uh

1564
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:30,640
so uh
 

1565
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,110
so uh
uh including the update of our uh

1566
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,120
uh including the update of our uh
 

1567
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,669
uh including the update of our uh

creation the possibility and the builder

1572
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:39,360
creation the possibility and the builder
 

1573
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,070
creation the possibility and the builder
for dows on everscale so actually

1574
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,080
for dows on everscale so actually
 

1575
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,669
for dows on everscale so actually
you already can now

1576
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:43,679
you already can now

you can take the sources and deploy your
 

1583
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,789
you can take the sources and deploy your
own one but we want to make it much

00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:52,799
own one but we want to make it much
 

1585
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,830
own one but we want to make it much
easier for projects to

on the decentralized fund protocols on
 

1601
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,870
on the decentralized fund protocols on
nft bridges and quite a lot

1602
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:10,880
nft bridges and quite a lot
 

1603
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,070
nft bridges and quite a lot
so uh

1604
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,080
so uh
 

1605
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,909
so uh
it's important to understand that uh on

1606
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:13,919
it's important to understand that uh on
 

1607
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,909
it's important to understand that uh on
a scale so you don't have a single team

1608
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:15,919
a scale so you don't have a single team
 

1609
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,230
a scale so you don't have a single team
that's developing everything

1610
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:18,240
that's developing everything
 

1611
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,230
that's developing everything
you have a lot of passionate uh

1612
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:20,240
you have a lot of passionate uh
 

1613
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,389
you have a lot of passionate uh
communities a lot of patient developers

1614
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:22,399
communities a lot of patient developers
 

1615
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,990
communities a lot of patient developers
who are focusing on developing their own

1616
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,000
who are focusing on developing their own
 

1617
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,389
who are focusing on developing their own
business and are doing this in ever

1618
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:26,399
business and are doing this in ever
 

1619
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,630
business and are doing this in ever
skill way decentralized

1620
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:28,640
skill way decentralized
 

1621
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,950
skill way decentralized
uh with strong focus on community uh

1622
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:30,960
uh with strong focus on community uh
 

1623
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,310
uh with strong focus on community uh
drilling approach

1624
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:32,320
drilling approach
 

1625
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,269
drilling approach
open sourcing uh most critical parts and

1626
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:35,279
open sourcing uh most critical parts and
 

1627
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,350
open sourcing uh most critical parts and
all this in everything so this is

1628
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:37,360
all this in everything so this is
 

1629
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,710
all this in everything so this is
something that really differs the

1630
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:38,720
something that really differs the
 

1631
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,389
something that really differs the
everscale community from most of the

1632
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:40,399
everscale community from most of the
 

1633
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,990
everscale community from most of the
other blockchain projects

1634
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,000

 

1635
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,990

just to highlight maybe a few things

1636
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,000
just to highlight maybe a few things
 

1637
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,710
just to highlight maybe a few things
that

1638
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:46,720
that
 

1639
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,310
that
are going to come

1640
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:48,320
are going to come
 

1641
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,389
are going to come
in the nearest future so first of all is

1642
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:50,399
in the nearest future so first of all is
 

1643
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,710
in the nearest future so first of all is
the smft consensus

1644
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:52,720
the smft consensus
 

1645
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,630
the smft consensus
that

1646
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:54,640
that
 

1647
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,470
that
will allow us to

1648
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:56,480
will allow us to
 

1649
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,789
will allow us to
bring even higher stability and

1650
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:58,799
bring even higher stability and
 

1651
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,669
bring even higher stability and
scalability of the network and reach the

1652
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:01,679
scalability of the network and reach the
 

1653
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,389
scalability of the network and reach the
sub second finality of all blocks

1654
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:04,399
sub second finality of all blocks
 

1655
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,990
sub second finality of all blocks
uh it will also help us to reduce

1656
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
uh it will also help us to reduce
 

1657
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,710
uh it will also help us to reduce
the gas fees at least by an order

1658
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:10,720
the gas fees at least by an order
 

1659
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,070
the gas fees at least by an order
of magnitude

1660
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,080
of magnitude
 

1661
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,029
of magnitude
uh

1662
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:13,039
uh
 

1663
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,630
uh
closer to the end of the year we will

1664
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:14,640
closer to the end of the year we will
 

1665
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,710
closer to the end of the year we will
switch to the dynamic guess

1666
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:16,720
switch to the dynamic guess
 

1667
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,190
switch to the dynamic guess
and so it will also mean that

1668
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,200
and so it will also mean that
 

1669
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,549
and so it will also mean that
the uh

1670
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:20,559
the uh
 

1671
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,630
the uh
dynamic gas rebalancing but even with

1672
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:22,640
dynamic gas rebalancing but even with
 

1673
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,389
dynamic gas rebalancing but even with
this approach so it will be much much

1674
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:24,399
this approach so it will be much much
 

1675
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,310
this approach so it will be much much
better than on ethereum

1676
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:26,320
better than on ethereum
 

1677
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,789
better than on ethereum
uh higher protocol

1678
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:28,799
uh higher protocol
 

1679
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,269
uh higher protocol
highest throughputs uh of course goes

1680
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:31,279
highest throughputs uh of course goes
 

1681
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,230
highest throughputs uh of course goes
without saying so we even don't cover

1682
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:34,240
without saying so we even don't cover
 

1683
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,389
without saying so we even don't cover
now so the existing throughput are never

1684
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:36,399
now so the existing throughput are never
 

1685
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,870
now so the existing throughput are never
scaled so and maybe you guys will help

1686
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:38,880
scaled so and maybe you guys will help
 

1687
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,269
scaled so and maybe you guys will help
us doing this uh ram protocol actually

1688
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:41,279
us doing this uh ram protocol actually
 

1689
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,149
us doing this uh ram protocol actually
has uh landed already and uh so now it

1690
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
has uh landed already and uh so now it
 

1691
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,430
has uh landed already and uh so now it
allows you to

1692
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:45,440
allows you to
 

1693
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,310
allows you to
uh

1694

messages within the network so uh

1698
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,039
messages within the network so uh
 

1699
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,509
messages within the network so uh
i'll take you guys uh we'll talk about

1700
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:53,519
i'll take you guys uh we'll talk about
 

1701
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,310
i'll take you guys uh we'll talk about
how

1702
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:54,320
how
 

1703
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,430
how
the network is functioning uh

1704
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:57,440
the network is functioning uh
 

1705
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,389
the network is functioning uh
once the low level so later

1706
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:00,399
once the low level so later
 

1707
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,230
once the low level so later
and a lot of other things actually

1708
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:04,240

 

1709
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,789

also what we are focusing on this year

1710
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:06,799
also what we are focusing on this year
 

1711
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,950
also what we are focusing on this year
is uh adding first of all the evm work

1712
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:08,960
is uh adding first of all the evm work
 

1713
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,510
is uh adding first of all the evm work
chain so it will allow uh existing

1714
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,520
chain so it will allow uh existing
 

1715
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,470

projects that are currently working on

1716
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:14,480
projects that are currently working on
 

1717
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,750
projects that are currently working on
other chains

1718
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:15,760
other chains
 

1719
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,950
other chains
to

1720
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:16,960
to
 

1721
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,270
to
easily hop on the error scale and

1722
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,280
easily hop on the error scale and
 

1723
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,510
easily hop on the error scale and
benefit from the connectivity it it

1724
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:21,520
benefit from the connectivity it it
 

1725
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,589
benefit from the connectivity it it
offers of course it will not be as

1726
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:23,599
offers of course it will not be as
 

1727
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,669
offers of course it will not be as
productive as a native ever scale but at

1728
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:25,679
productive as a native ever scale but at
 

1729
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,149
productive as a native ever scale but at
least it will be a transition place that

1730
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,159
least it will be a transition place that
 

1731
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,750

pieces that you need to do this with the

1772
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:20,079
pieces that you need to do this with the
 

1773
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,550
pieces that you need to do this with the
chip store so it will be kind of uh ipfs

1774
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:22,560
chip store so it will be kind of uh ipfs
 

1775
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,069
chip store so it will be kind of uh ipfs
but this is a truly on on-chain stuff

so maybe they will also join the

1834
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,160
so maybe they will also join the
 

1835
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,950
so maybe they will also join the
hackathon

1836
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:32,960

 

1837
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,430

and those guys are doing

1838
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:35,440
and those guys are doing
 

1839
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,870
and those guys are doing
the things that will

1840
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:36,880
the things that will
 

1841
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,030
the things that will
affect the lives of each of us

affect the lives of each of us
 

1843
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,950
affect the lives of each of us
so and actually this is something that

1844
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:40,960
so and actually this is something that
 

1845
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,910
so and actually this is something that
has started already in europe uh when uh

1846
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:43,920
has started already in europe uh when uh
 

1847
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,670
has started already in europe uh when uh
all the data controlled by you and you

1848
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:45,680
all the data controlled by you and you
 

1849
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,310
all the data controlled by you and you
can easily uh control the level of

1850
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:48,320
can easily uh control the level of
 

1851

2182
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:24,880
constellation of d5 platforms that
 

2183
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,510
constellation of d5 platforms that
have really made a big impact in the

2184
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:27,520
have really made a big impact in the
 

2185
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,549
have really made a big impact in the
everscale ecosystem but also in d5 as a

2186
00:52:30,549 --> 00:52:30,559
everscale ecosystem but also in d5 as a
 

2187
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:31,430

is that it's always been here it's
 

2231
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,549
is that it's always been here it's
always been technology first you build

2232
00:53:20,549 --> 00:53:20,559
always been technology first you build
 

2233
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,710
always been technology first you build
something that really works first and

2234

something that really works first and
 

2235
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,390
something that really works first and
then you move on and you tell people

2236
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:24,400
then you move on and you tell people
 

2237
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,470
then you move on and you tell people
about it and people are ready to believe

about it and people are ready to believe
 

2239
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,990
about it and people are ready to believe
in you because you believe in what

2240
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,000
in you because you believe in what
 

2241
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,150
in you because you believe in what
you're building and what you've built

years old
 

2253
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,349
years old
uh we started around the same time as

2254
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:45,359
uh we started around the same time as
 

2255
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,270
uh we started around the same time as
everscale was launched

2256
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:47,280
everscale was launched
 

2257
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,109
everscale was launched
uh and the idea at the beginning was to

2258
00:53:49,109 --> 00:53:49,119
uh and the idea at the beginning was to
 

2259
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,589
uh and the idea at the beginning was to
bring in the most talented people in d5

who can build that vision that we had

2266
00:53:57,829 --> 00:53:57,839
who can build that vision that we had
 

2267
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,230
who can build that vision that we had
and could translate that potential that

2268
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:00,240
and could translate that potential that
 

2269
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,109
and could translate that potential that
was in d5 that so often gets missed by

2270
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:03,119
was in d5 that so often gets missed by
 

2271
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,589
was in d5 that so often gets missed by
other developers into something that was

2272
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:05,599
other developers into something that was
 

2273
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,829
other developers into something that was
practical and into something that

2274
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:07,839
practical and into something that
 

2275
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,349
practical and into something that
everybody could use because that's what

2276
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:09,359
everybody could use because that's what
 

2277
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,109
everybody could use because that's what
d5 was supposed to be about

d5 was supposed to be about
 

2279
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,710
d5 was supposed to be about
uh we're going to talk i think there's

2280
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:12,720
uh we're going to talk i think there's
 

2281
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,030
uh we're going to talk i think there's
uh we've shown some slides here about

2282
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:15,040
uh we've shown some slides here about
 

2283
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,069
uh we've shown some slides here about
and vlad mentioned it uh p-e-t-s-d so

2284
00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:18,079
and vlad mentioned it uh p-e-t-s-d so
 

2285
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:19,990
and vlad mentioned it uh p-e-t-s-d so
post-ethereum transaction stress

disorder um basically it's a it's a joke

2288
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:23,200
disorder um basically it's a it's a joke
 

2289
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,549
disorder um basically it's a it's a joke
but uh

2290
00:54:24,549 --> 00:54:24,559
but uh
 

2291
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:25,829
but uh
it isn't

2292
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:25,839
it isn't
 

2293
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:29,190
it isn't
tenable to have very very high fees very

2294
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:29,200
tenable to have very very high fees very
 

2295
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,670
tenable to have very very high fees very
slow uh transaction times what we're

2296
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:31,680
slow uh transaction times what we're
 

2297
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,829
slow uh transaction times what we're
trying to do is make finance available

2298
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:33,839
trying to do is make finance available
 

2299
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,349
trying to do is make finance available
to everybody so

2300
00:54:35,349 --> 00:54:35,359
to everybody so
 

2301
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,430
to everybody so
if finance if defy is only going to be

2302
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:37,440
if finance if defy is only going to be
 

2303
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,510
if finance if defy is only going to be
available available to very wealthy

2304
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:39,520
available available to very wealthy
 

2305
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:44,150
available available to very wealthy
people it's just not going to work

2306
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:44,160

 

2307
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,990

the way that this is possible is because

2308
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,000
the way that this is possible is because
 

2309
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,390
the way that this is possible is because
it's built on the everscale network

2310
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:48,400
it's built on the everscale network
 

2311
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,190
it's built on the everscale network
which vlad just talked at length about

2312
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:51,200
which vlad just talked at length about
 

2313
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,270
which vlad just talked at length about
um so given that everscale is the flash

2314
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:55,280
um so given that everscale is the flash
 

2315
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,109
um so given that everscale is the flash
is the fastest blockchain

2316
00:54:57,109 --> 00:54:57,119
is the fastest blockchain
 

2317
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,109
is the fastest blockchain
around

2318
00:54:59,109 --> 00:54:59,119
around
 

2319
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,910
around
and can scale toward uh to fit any

2320
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:01,920
and can scale toward uh to fit any
 

2321
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,109
and can scale toward uh to fit any
project

2322
00:55:03,109 --> 00:55:03,119
project
 

2323
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:06,630
project
um that makes it that gave us the

2324
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:06,640
um that makes it that gave us the
 

2325
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,510
um that makes it that gave us the
technological foundation to do what we

2326
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:09,520
technological foundation to do what we
 

2327
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,750
technological foundation to do what we
wanted to do with um with these

2328
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:11,760
wanted to do with um with these
 

2329
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,230
wanted to do with um with these
different with our our dex platform with

2330
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:14,240
different with our our dex platform with
 

2331
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,990
different with our our dex platform with
our bridge platform with our wallet and

2332
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:16,000
our bridge platform with our wallet and
 

2333
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,430
our bridge platform with our wallet and
with all the other platforms that we

2334
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:17,440
with all the other platforms that we
 

2335
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,030
with all the other platforms that we
build wouldn't have been possible

2336
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,040
build wouldn't have been possible
 

2337
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,230
build wouldn't have been possible
without that underlying solidity that

2338
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:22,240
without that underlying solidity that
 

2339
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,950
without that underlying solidity that
underlying basis

2340
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:26,960

 

2341
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,470

so a bit about our philosophy i just

2342
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:28,480
so a bit about our philosophy i just
 

2343
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,870
so a bit about our philosophy i just
kind of mentioned this but um

2344
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:30,880
kind of mentioned this but um
 

2345
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,430
kind of mentioned this but um
we're committed to to transparency

2346
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:33,440
we're committed to to transparency
 

2347
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,950
we're committed to to transparency
decentralization

2348
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:34,960
decentralization
 

2349
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,829
decentralization
and

2350
00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:35,839
and
 

2351
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,910
and
creating solutions that are efficient

2352
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:37,920
creating solutions that are efficient
 

2353
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,910
creating solutions that are efficient
that are easy to understand that are

2354
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:39,920
that are easy to understand that are
 

2355
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,670
that are easy to understand that are
sustainable and that anybody can use

2356
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:43,680
sustainable and that anybody can use
 

2357
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,190
sustainable and that anybody can use
um and in the end where we're going is

2358
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:47,200
um and in the end where we're going is
 

2359
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,309
um and in the end where we're going is
uh we we said the first slide says web 3

2360
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:50,319
uh we we said the first slide says web 3
 

2361
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:53,030
uh we we said the first slide says web 3
is not not as far away as you think um

2362
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:53,040
is not not as far away as you think um
 

2363
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,630
is not not as far away as you think um
yeah that's that's what we're aiming at

2364
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:54,640
yeah that's that's what we're aiming at
 

2365
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,870
yeah that's that's what we're aiming at
web 3 complete web 3

2366
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:56,880
web 3 complete web 3
 

2367
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,789
web 3 complete web 3
and not just for

2368
00:55:58,789 --> 00:55:58,799
and not just for
 

2369
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,829
and not just for
technically savvy people but for

2370
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:00,839
technically savvy people but for
 

2371
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:02,710
technically savvy people but for
everybody because it's something that

2372
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:02,720
everybody because it's something that
 

2373
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,630
everybody because it's something that
the that the world definitely needs

2374
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:04,640
the that the world definitely needs
 

2375
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,789
the that the world definitely needs
right now if we think back to when uh

2376
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:06,799
right now if we think back to when uh
 

2377
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,789
right now if we think back to when uh
bitcoin itself was founded it was

2378
00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:08,799
bitcoin itself was founded it was
 

2379
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:12,150
bitcoin itself was founded it was
founded on the heels of the 2008 um

2380
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:12,160
founded on the heels of the 2008 um
 

2381
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,990
founded on the heels of the 2008 um
recession um

2382
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:14,000
recession um
 

2383
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,829
recession um
and so i feel like i think a lot of

2384
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:15,839
and so i feel like i think a lot of
 

2385
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,150
and so i feel like i think a lot of
people feel that uh there are a lot of

2386
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:18,160
people feel that uh there are a lot of
 

2387
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,750
people feel that uh there are a lot of
companies in the space that have kind of

2388
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:19,760
companies in the space that have kind of
 

2389
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,750
companies in the space that have kind of
lost their focus on that original

2390
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:21,760
lost their focus on that original
 

2391
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,309
lost their focus on that original
promise um that was here in this space

2392
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:24,319
promise um that was here in this space
 

2393
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,990
promise um that was here in this space
and one of the great things about brox's

2394
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:26,000
and one of the great things about brox's
 

2395
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,829
and one of the great things about brox's
at least from my perspective is that

2396
00:56:27,829 --> 00:56:27,839
at least from my perspective is that
 

2397
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,750
at least from my perspective is that
we've never lost that focus

2398
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:29,760
we've never lost that focus
 

2399
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,870
we've never lost that focus
and so i found that inspiring

2400
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:32,880
and so i found that inspiring
 

2401
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,630
and so i found that inspiring
so our big platforms this is the

2402
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:34,640
so our big platforms this is the
 

2403
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,430
so our big platforms this is the
constellation of uh of

2404
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:37,440
constellation of uh of
 

2405
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,309
constellation of uh of
our

2406
00:56:38,309 --> 00:56:38,319
our
 

2407
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:40,789
our
flagship platforms first is access

2408
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:40,799
flagship platforms first is access
 

2409
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:41,990
flagship platforms first is access
bridge

2410
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:42,000
bridge
 

2411
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,150
bridge
vlad talked a bit about access bridge

2412
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:44,160
vlad talked a bit about access bridge
 

2413
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,470
vlad talked a bit about access bridge
it's a unique platform uh

2414
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:46,480
it's a unique platform uh
 

2415
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,309
it's a unique platform uh
people who use it

2416
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:48,319
people who use it
 

2417
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,950
people who use it
they're all uh i mean we've we've grown

2418
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:50,960
they're all uh i mean we've we've grown
 

2419

how easy it is to use and the problems
 

2423
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,150
how easy it is to use and the problems
that that it solves so vlad talked about

2424
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:58,160
that that it solves so vlad talked about
 

2425
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:58,950
that that it solves so vlad talked about
um

2426
00:56:58,950 --> 00:56:58,960
um
 

2427
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,030
um
the the problems with defy the the uh

2428
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:01,040
the the problems with defy the the uh
 

2429
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,430
the the problems with defy the the uh
trilemma right so what's the trilemma

2430
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:03,440
trilemma right so what's the trilemma
 

2431
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:08,150
trilemma right so what's the trilemma
trilemma is that a d5 platform can't be

2432
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:08,160
trilemma is that a d5 platform can't be
 

2433
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,829
trilemma is that a d5 platform can't be
all three things that it needs to be

2434
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:09,839
all three things that it needs to be
 

2435
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,549
all three things that it needs to be
right it has to be scalable it has to be

2436
00:57:12,549 --> 00:57:12,559
right it has to be scalable it has to be
 

2437
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,630
right it has to be scalable it has to be
secure

2438
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:14,640
secure
 

2439
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:20,390
secure
and what was the what's the third thing

2440
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:20,400

 

2441
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,030

decentralized right yeah so scalable

2442
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:23,040
decentralized right yeah so scalable
 

2443
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,270
decentralized right yeah so scalable
decentralized and secure most platforms

2444
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:27,280
decentralized and secure most platforms
 

2445
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,190
decentralized and secure most platforms
can accomplish two of those things but

2446
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:29,200
can accomplish two of those things but
 

2447
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,230
can accomplish two of those things but
uh

2448
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:30,240
uh
 

2449
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,789
uh
up until now essentially there hasn't

2450
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:32,799
up until now essentially there hasn't
 

2451
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,710
up until now essentially there hasn't
been a platform that's been able to

2452
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:34,720
been a platform that's been able to
 

2453
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,589
been a platform that's been able to
solve all three you can be scalable

2454
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:37,599
solve all three you can be scalable
 

2455
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,349
solve all three you can be scalable
and secure but you can't be

2456
00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:39,359
and secure but you can't be
 

2457
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,750
and secure but you can't be
decentralized or you can be one uh two

2458
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:41,760
decentralized or you can be one uh two
 

2459
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,670
decentralized or you can be one uh two
of the others and not one of the the

2460
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:43,680
of the others and not one of the the
 

2461
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,390
of the others and not one of the the
remaining one

2462
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:46,400
remaining one
 

2463
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,349
remaining one
so to start with octus bridge

2464
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:49,359
so to start with octus bridge
 

2465
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,270
so to start with octus bridge
basically what it does as vlad explained

2466
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:51,280
basically what it does as vlad explained
 

2467
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,109
basically what it does as vlad explained
it does uh crosstalk cross chain

2468
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:53,119
it does uh crosstalk cross chain
 

2469
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:58,789
it does uh crosstalk cross chain

cross-train solution that allows you to

2480
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:10,960
cross-train solution that allows you to
 

2481
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,470
cross-train solution that allows you to
work not only on the token level but

2482
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:12,480
work not only on the token level but
 

2483
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,390
work not only on the token level but
also with arbitrary data and smart

2484
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:14,400
also with arbitrary data and smart
 

2485
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,549
also with arbitrary data and smart
contract callouts um basically what that

2486
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:16,559
contract callouts um basically what that
 

2487
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,230
contract callouts um basically what that
means is that the everyday user can use

2488
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:18,240
means is that the everyday user can use
 

2489
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,510
means is that the everyday user can use
it right but then also and it's an ideal

2490
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:21,520
it right but then also and it's an ideal
 

2491
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,829
it right but then also and it's an ideal
solution just like uh the everest

2492
00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:23,839
solution just like uh the everest
 

2493

kind of project you're running this too

2496
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:28,240
kind of project you're running this too
 

2497
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,349
kind of project you're running this too
is scalable to uh in the sense that it

2498
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:31,359
is scalable to uh in the sense that it
 

2499
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:33,430
is scalable to uh in the sense that it
it fits the needs of the individual user

2500
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:33,440
it fits the needs of the individual user
 

2501
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,390
it fits the needs of the individual user
but also these bigger projects and the

2502
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:36,400
but also these bigger projects and the
 

2503
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,829
but also these bigger projects and the
way that that works is because it is

2504
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:37,839
way that that works is because it is
 

2505
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:39,910
way that that works is because it is

00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,230
uh 0.0 um
i think it's it's less than a penny so a

2526
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:04,240
i think it's it's less than a penny so a
 

2527
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,470
i think it's it's less than a penny so a
fifth of a penny uh

2528
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:06,480
fifth of a penny uh
 

2529
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,430
fifth of a penny uh
multi-network um so the big the big

2530
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:09,440
multi-network um so the big the big
 

2531
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,589
multi-network um so the big the big
feature here is that it is connected to

2532
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:11,599
feature here is that it is connected to
 

2533
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,030
feature here is that it is connected to
some of the uh

2534
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:13,040
some of the uh
 

2535
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,589
some of the uh
the biggest networks in um in

2536
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:15,599
the biggest networks in um in
 

2537
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,670
the biggest networks in um in
cryptocurrency and in d5

2538
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:17,680
cryptocurrency and in d5
 

2539

and then it's scalable obviously

2540
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:20,799
and then it's scalable obviously
 

2541
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:24,390
and then it's scalable obviously
which allows us to not only um

2542
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:24,400
which allows us to not only um
 

2543
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,990
which allows us to not only um
have all the network networks we have

2544
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:26,000
have all the network networks we have
 

2545
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,910
have all the network networks we have
now but we're also working on bringing

2546
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:27,920
now but we're also working on bringing
 

2547
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,950
now but we're also working on bringing
in more

2548
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:28,960
in more
 

2549
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,150
in more
um so we're still pretty much at the

2550
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:32,160
um so we're still pretty much at the
 

2551
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,710
um so we're still pretty much at the
early stages in this in this project we

2552
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:34,720
early stages in this in this project we
 

2553
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,710
early stages in this in this project we
already have a big user base

2554
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:36,720
already have a big user base
 

2555
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,270
already have a big user base
you can uh check out the numbers here

i mean if you want to do this without a
platform like this you're going to have

2640
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:12,000
platform like this you're going to have
 

2641
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,470
platform like this you're going to have
to go through five or six gateways that

2642
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:14,480
to go through five or six gateways that
 

2643
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,230
to go through five or six gateways that
you have to pay here here here you

01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:16,240
you have to pay here here here you
 

2645
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,549
you have to pay here here here you

upper ability uh so

2652
01:01:24,549 --> 01:01:24,559
upper ability uh so
 

2653
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:25,829
upper ability uh so
we have another slide that's coming up

2654
01:01:25,829 --> 01:01:25,839
we have another slide that's coming up
 

2655
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,510
we have another slide that's coming up
so i'll talk a bit more about it then

2656
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:27,520
so i'll talk a bit more about it then
 

2657
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,630
so i'll talk a bit more about it then
but basically it's the idea that we just

2658
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:30,640
but basically it's the idea that we just
 

2659
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,030
but basically it's the idea that we just
have one innervate interface the

2660
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:33,040
have one innervate interface the
 

2661
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:36,230
have one innervate interface the
octus bridge interface um or you can

2662
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:36,240
octus bridge interface um or you can
 

2663
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,390
octus bridge interface um or you can
take the api and put it into your own

2664
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:38,400
take the api and put it into your own
 

2665
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,589
take the api and put it into your own
platform

2666
01:01:39,589 --> 01:01:39,599
platform
 

2667
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:42,150
platform
and have your own single interface but

2668
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:42,160
and have your own single interface but
 

2669
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,670
and have your own single interface but
it takes care of everything behind the

01:04:50,069 --> 01:04:50,079
different connected uh bridges so it's a
 

2837
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:51,910
different connected uh bridges so it's a
very cool feature if you guys haven't

2838
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:51,920
very cool feature if you guys haven't
 

2839
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,910
very cool feature if you guys haven't
checked it out i recommend you you do so

2840
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:55,920
checked it out i recommend you you do so
 

2841
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,750
checked it out i recommend you you do so
relayers we talked about this before so

2842
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:57,760
relayers we talked about this before so
 

2843
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,349
relayers we talked about this before so
i'm not going to dwell on this but

2844
01:04:59,349 --> 01:04:59,359
i'm not going to dwell on this but
 

2845
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:01,430
i'm not going to dwell on this but
they're spread out around the world

2846
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:01,440
they're spread out around the world
 

2847
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,549
they're spread out around the world
these

2848
01:05:02,549 --> 01:05:02,559
these
 

2849
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:03,789
these
this is part of that that

2850
01:05:03,789 --> 01:05:03,799
this is part of that that
 

2851
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:06,309
this is part of that that
decentralization thing which is very

2852
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:06,319
decentralization thing which is very
 

2853
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:09,270
decentralization thing which is very
important to us so not only do we have

2854
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:09,280
important to us so not only do we have
 

2855
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,470
important to us so not only do we have
relayers that are separated um

2856
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:12,480
relayers that are separated um
 

2857
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,470
relayers that are separated um
in different geographical locations and

2858
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:14,480
in different geographical locations and
 

2859
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,470
in different geographical locations and
disconnected from each other

2860
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:16,480
disconnected from each other
 

2861
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,390
disconnected from each other
but we also have a backup system that

2862
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:18,400
but we also have a backup system that
 

2863
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,230
but we also have a backup system that
checks to make sure that these

2864
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:20,240
checks to make sure that these
 

2865
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,710
checks to make sure that these
relayers are not acting in bad faith and

2866
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:22,720
relayers are not acting in bad faith and
 

2867
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,710
relayers are not acting in bad faith and
if they are acting in bad faith uh

2868
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:24,720
if they are acting in bad faith uh
 

2869
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,150
if they are acting in bad faith uh
they'll be slashed and there will be

2870
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:26,160
they'll be slashed and there will be
 

2871
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,950
they'll be slashed and there will be
repercussions for it um eventually we're

2872
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:28,960
repercussions for it um eventually we're
 

2873
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,950
repercussions for it um eventually we're
gonna have uh we're gonna have more than

2874
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:30,960
gonna have uh we're gonna have more than
 

2875
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,029
gonna have uh we're gonna have more than
100 relayers right but

2876
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:33,039
100 relayers right but
 

2877
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:35,670
100 relayers right but
uh there will only be 100 relayers that

2878
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:35,680
uh there will only be 100 relayers that
 

2879
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,109
uh there will only be 100 relayers that
will be able to verify these

2880
01:05:37,109 --> 01:05:37,119
will be able to verify these
 

2881
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:39,029
will be able to verify these
transactions at a time

2882
01:05:39,029 --> 01:05:39,039
transactions at a time
 

2883
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:40,950
transactions at a time
which actually improves the security

2884
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:40,960
which actually improves the security
 

2885
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,150
which actually improves the security
because it randomizes it a bit

2886
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:44,160
because it randomizes it a bit
 

2887
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,349
because it randomizes it a bit
and doesn't give power more power to

2888
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:47,359
and doesn't give power more power to
 

2889
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:50,789
and doesn't give power more power to
a specific relay or a specific

2890
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:50,799
a specific relay or a specific
 

2891
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:54,150
a specific relay or a specific
individual

2892
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:54,160

 

2893
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,150

there you can see the uh the currently

2894
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:56,160
there you can see the uh the currently
 

2895
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,990
there you can see the uh the currently
connected blockchains obviously uh

2896
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:58,000
connected blockchains obviously uh
 

2897
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,710
connected blockchains obviously uh
everscale is one of them as well so

2898
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:00,720
everscale is one of them as well so
 

2899
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,630
everscale is one of them as well so
we have seven right now and then we're

2900
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:02,640
we have seven right now and then we're
 

2901
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,029
we have seven right now and then we're
we are in the process of adding solana

2902
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:05,039
we are in the process of adding solana
 

2903
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:08,150
we are in the process of adding solana
and near um two other very very large

2904
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:08,160
and near um two other very very large
 

2905
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,630
and near um two other very very large
uh blockchains um and you look at all

2906
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:10,640
uh blockchains um and you look at all
 

2907
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,789
uh blockchains um and you look at all
the different projects there solana near

2908
01:06:12,789 --> 01:06:12,799
the different projects there solana near
 

2909
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:15,510
the different projects there solana near
solana especially is one of the bigger

2910
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:15,520
solana especially is one of the bigger
 

2911
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,829
solana especially is one of the bigger
nft

2912
01:06:17,829 --> 01:06:17,839
nft
 

2913
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:18,870
nft
so

2914
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:18,880
so
 

2915
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,630
so
this is going to open up a lot of doors

2916
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:20,640
this is going to open up a lot of doors
 

2917
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,670
this is going to open up a lot of doors
a lot of different possibilities for

2918
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:23,680
a lot of different possibilities for
 

2919
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,029
a lot of different possibilities for
for everscale

2920
01:06:25,029 --> 01:06:25,039
for everscale
 

2921
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:28,870
for everscale
and for broxas because

2922
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:28,880

 

2923
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,390

that will bring in

2924
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:30,400
that will bring in
 

2925
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,270
that will bring in
um it's diffic it can be difficult uh to

2926
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:33,280
um it's diffic it can be difficult uh to
 

2927
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,950
um it's diffic it can be difficult uh to
do to create nfts launch nfts uh launch

2928
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:36,960
do to create nfts launch nfts uh launch
 

2929
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,750
do to create nfts launch nfts uh launch
gamify projects on platforms that are

2930
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:39,760
gamify projects on platforms that are
 

2931
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,029
gamify projects on platforms that are
not equipped to handle the huge load

2932
01:06:43,029 --> 01:06:43,039
not equipped to handle the huge load
 

2933
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:44,710
not equipped to handle the huge load
that that kind of thing brings in like a

2934
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:44,720
that that kind of thing brings in like a
 

2935
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:45,510
that that kind of thing brings in like a
game

2936
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:45,520
game
 

2937
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,910
game
is uh that carries a huge load with it

2938
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:47,920
is uh that carries a huge load with it
 

2939
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,630
is uh that carries a huge load with it
everscale is is the network that can

2940
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:50,640
everscale is is the network that can
 

2941
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,870
everscale is is the network that can
actually handle these things and so once

2942
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:52,880
actually handle these things and so once
 

2943
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,230
actually handle these things and so once
we've opened these gateways to these

2944
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:54,240
we've opened these gateways to these
 

2945
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,950
we've opened these gateways to these
other networks it'll it'll uh

2946
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:56,960
other networks it'll it'll uh
 

2947
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,829
other networks it'll it'll uh
inspire an influx of new users to to

2948
01:06:59,829 --> 01:06:59,839
inspire an influx of new users to to
 

2949
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:03,190
inspire an influx of new users to to
ever scale

2950
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:03,200

 

2951
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:06,069

so the tokenomics here

2952
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:06,079
so the tokenomics here
 

2953
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,430
so the tokenomics here
distribution we've got 65 percent uh of

2954
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:09,440
distribution we've got 65 percent uh of
 

2955
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,190
distribution we've got 65 percent uh of
the bridge token

2956
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:11,200
the bridge token
 

2957
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,109
the bridge token
in farming for four years

2958
01:07:13,109 --> 01:07:13,119
in farming for four years
 

2959
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:15,349
in farming for four years
twelve percent it goes the roxas team

2960
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:15,359
twelve percent it goes the roxas team
 

2961
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:17,270
twelve percent it goes the roxas team
eleven percent is under the everscale d5

2962
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:17,280
eleven percent is under the everscale d5
 

2963
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,390
eleven percent is under the everscale d5
alliance

2964
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:18,400
alliance
 

2965
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,670
alliance
and there's a twelve percent uh pre-sale

2966
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:21,680
and there's a twelve percent uh pre-sale
 

2967
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,430
and there's a twelve percent uh pre-sale
um the bridge token itself that is

2968
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:25,440
um the bridge token itself that is
 

2969
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,710
um the bridge token itself that is
uh what enables the dow to work so

2970
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:28,720
uh what enables the dow to work so
 

2971
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,390
uh what enables the dow to work so
with the bridge token you stake a

2972
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:30,400
with the bridge token you stake a
 

2973
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,910
with the bridge token you stake a
certain amount of it you can become a

2974
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:31,920
certain amount of it you can become a
 

2975
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,710
certain amount of it you can become a
relayer you stake a different amount

2976
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:34,720
relayer you stake a different amount
 

2977
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,870
relayer you stake a different amount
that's the maximum but if you stick a

2978
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:36,880
that's the maximum but if you stick a
 

2979
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,789
that's the maximum but if you stick a
different amount you'll be able to

2980
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:38,799
different amount you'll be able to
 

2981
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:40,230
different amount you'll be able to
participate in

2982
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:40,240
participate in
 

2983
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,630
participate in
in voting on different proposals on the

2984
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:42,640
in voting on different proposals on the
 

2985
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,109
in voting on different proposals on the
the bridge platform um and so that's

2986
01:07:45,109 --> 01:07:45,119
the bridge platform um and so that's
 

2987
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,990
the bridge platform um and so that's
important too uh we want um this

2988
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:48,000
important too uh we want um this
 

2989
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,670
important too uh we want um this
platform to

2990
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:49,680
platform to
 

2991
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,390
platform to
reflect what the industry actually needs

2992
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:52,400
reflect what the industry actually needs
 

2993
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,150
reflect what the industry actually needs
and so the only way to really do that is

2994
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:54,160
and so the only way to really do that is
 

2995
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,470
and so the only way to really do that is
to make it actually decentralized and

2996
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:56,480
to make it actually decentralized and
 

2997
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,430
to make it actually decentralized and

chain link does
 

3055
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,189
chain link does
but this is all going to

3056
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:01,199
but this is all going to
 

3057
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:03,590
but this is all going to
make the platform much more formidable

3058
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:03,600
make the platform much more formidable
 

3059
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,990
make the platform much more formidable
but also bring in a lot of new people

3060
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:06,000
but also bring in a lot of new people
 

3061
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,990
but also bring in a lot of new people
not a lot of new users

3062
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:10,000

 

3063
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,669

all right so next is flat cube our decks

and it was built by taking all the all
 

3081
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:35,990
and it was built by taking all the all
the best features of these bigger um

3082
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:36,000
the best features of these bigger um
 

3083
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,229
the best features of these bigger um
dexes like uniswap

01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:41,199
uh and bringing them into um into
 

3087
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:44,149
uh and bringing them into um into
everscale where they can really flourish

3088
01:09:44,149 --> 01:09:44,159
everscale where they can really flourish
 

3089
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:46,630

um along with

3090
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:46,640
um along with
 

3091
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,189
um along with
the same thing goes for for flat cube uh

3092
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:49,199
the same thing goes for for flat cube uh
 

3093
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:50,390
the same thing goes for for flat cube uh
that goes for

3094
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:50,400
that goes for
 

3095
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,470
that goes for
uh the octus bridge in terms of how fast

3096
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:52,480
uh the octus bridge in terms of how fast
 

3097
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,510
uh the octus bridge in terms of how fast
it is

3098
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:53,520
it is
 

3099
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,830
it is
um how easy it is to use

3100
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:55,840
um how easy it is to use
 

3101
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,550
um how easy it is to use
um and then also we have a ton of

3102
01:09:58,550 --> 01:09:58,560
um and then also we have a ton of
 

3103
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,189
um and then also we have a ton of
farming and staking opportunities with

3104
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:01,199
farming and staking opportunities with
 

3105
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,189
farming and staking opportunities with
really high aprs

3106
01:10:03,189 --> 01:10:03,199
really high aprs
 

3107
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,189
really high aprs
that have helped us build up a really

3108
01:10:05,189 --> 01:10:05,199
that have helped us build up a really
 

3109
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:06,950
that have helped us build up a really
solid user base of people who are

3110
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:06,960
solid user base of people who are
 

3111
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,390
solid user base of people who are
passionate about using it and who

3112
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:08,400
passionate about using it and who
 

3113
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:12,870
passionate about using it and who
believe in it uh in the long term

3114
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:12,880

 

3115
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,990

so the basic function is asset swap

3116
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:16,000
so the basic function is asset swap
 

3117
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,510
so the basic function is asset swap
cross pair swaps and multi-sig support

3118
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:19,520
cross pair swaps and multi-sig support
 

3119
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,229
cross pair swaps and multi-sig support
um in figures like i said over 80 we had

3120
01:10:22,229 --> 01:10:22,239
um in figures like i said over 80 we had
 

3121
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:23,590
um in figures like i said over 80 we had
83

3122
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:23,600
83
 

3123
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,669
83
24 hour hour volume is two and a half

3124
01:10:25,669 --> 01:10:25,679
24 hour hour volume is two and a half
 

3125
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,830
24 hour hour volume is two and a half
million transaction speed less than two

3126
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:27,840
million transaction speed less than two
 

3127
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,189
million transaction speed less than two
seconds so i challenge you guys to find

3128
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:31,199
seconds so i challenge you guys to find
 

3129
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:34,390
seconds so i challenge you guys to find
uh find a dex that has a faster one and

3130
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:34,400
uh find a dex that has a faster one and
 

3131
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,470
uh find a dex that has a faster one and
then transaction cost is all right so

3132
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:36,480
then transaction cost is all right so
 

3133
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,590
then transaction cost is all right so
it's uh

3134
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:37,600
it's uh
 

3135
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,910
it's uh
three cents i believe

3136
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:41,920

 

3137
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,590

swapping is very easy

3138
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:43,600
swapping is very easy
 

3139
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,030
swapping is very easy
i'm sure some of you have used it before

3140
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:45,040
i'm sure some of you have used it before
 

3141
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,229
i'm sure some of you have used it before
but all you have to do is connect your

3142
01:10:46,229 --> 01:10:46,239
but all you have to do is connect your
 

3143
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:48,149
but all you have to do is connect your
wallet select a token select an amount

3144
01:10:48,149 --> 01:10:48,159
wallet select a token select an amount
 

3145
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:51,350
wallet select a token select an amount
and then just make a swap

3146
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:51,360

 

3147
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,669

the thing that you need on our end to

3148
01:10:53,669 --> 01:10:53,679
the thing that you need on our end to
 

3149
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:55,669
the thing that you need on our end to
use it is the everwallet and that's

3150
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:55,679
use it is the everwallet and that's
 

3151
01:10:55,679 --> 01:11:00,070
use it is the everwallet and that's
going to be the next thing i cover but

3152
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:00,080

 

3153
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,470

one of the key parts of the flat cube

3154
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:02,480
one of the key parts of the flat cube
 

3155
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,390
one of the key parts of the flat cube
decks is the wrapped ever token so

3156
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:04,400
decks is the wrapped ever token so
 

3157
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,149
decks is the wrapped ever token so
wrapped ever allows

3158
01:11:06,149 --> 01:11:06,159
wrapped ever allows
 

3159
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:09,110
wrapped ever allows
us to interact with tokens from other

3160
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:09,120
us to interact with tokens from other
 

3161
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,910
us to interact with tokens from other

and it's it can be exchanged one for one

3170
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:19,920
and it's it can be exchanged one for one
 

3171
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,550
and it's it can be exchanged one for one
with uh with ever it's a very easy

other dexes on the market right so
 

3185
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,430
other dexes on the market right so
current market problems um

01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:39,440
current market problems um
 

3187
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,110
current market problems um
a lot of miners and mining pools can

a lot of miners and mining pools can
 

3189
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,270
a lot of miners and mining pools can

decentralized exchanges that kind of

3194
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:46,800
decentralized exchanges that kind of
 

3195
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,470
decentralized exchanges that kind of
violates the whole idea of

01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:48,480
violates the whole idea of
 

3197
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,630
violates the whole idea of
decentralization

3198
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:50,640
decentralization
 

3199
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,030
decentralization
we don't need the miners and

3200
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:53,040
we don't need the miners and
 

3201
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,510
we don't need the miners and
mining pools shouldn't have uh

3202
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:55,520
mining pools shouldn't have uh
 

3203
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,590
mining pools shouldn't have uh
a strong grip on power they shouldn't

3204
01:11:57,590 --> 01:11:57,600
a strong grip on power they shouldn't
 

3205
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,070
a strong grip on power they shouldn't
have that much of a grip on power

3206
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:00,080
have that much of a grip on power
 

3207
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,229
have that much of a grip on power
true decentralization

3208
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:02,239
true decentralization
 

3209
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:05,910
true decentralization
it's very hard to come by in d5

3210
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:05,920
it's very hard to come by in d5
 

3211
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:09,270
it's very hard to come by in d5
a bit of an oxymoron but uh

3212
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:09,280
a bit of an oxymoron but uh
 

3213
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,669
a bit of an oxymoron but uh
everyone's still striving for that that

3214
01:12:11,669 --> 01:12:11,679
everyone's still striving for that that
 

3215
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:14,310
everyone's still striving for that that
true decentralization uh but the way

3216
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:14,320
true decentralization uh but the way
 

3217
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,149
true decentralization uh but the way
that a lot of these platforms are set up

3218
01:12:16,149 --> 01:12:16,159
that a lot of these platforms are set up
 

3219
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:19,189
that a lot of these platforms are set up
they're not actually decentralized

3220
01:12:19,189 --> 01:12:19,199
they're not actually decentralized
 

3221
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,189
they're not actually decentralized
and then of course transaction speed and

3222
01:12:21,189 --> 01:12:21,199
and then of course transaction speed and
 

3223
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:22,470
and then of course transaction speed and
fees

3224
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:22,480
fees
 

3225
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,189
fees
so there nobody's got us beat

3226
01:12:25,189 --> 01:12:25,199
so there nobody's got us beat
 

3227
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:27,910
so there nobody's got us beat
this is just an example this is uh

3228
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:27,920
this is just an example this is uh
 

3229
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,590
this is just an example this is uh
this is what gives people p e t s d

3230
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:31,600
this is what gives people p e t s d
 

3231
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,510
this is what gives people p e t s d
so you look at the low

3232
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:33,520
so you look at the low
 

3233
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,350
so you look at the low
gas fee it's over 200

3234
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:35,360
gas fee it's over 200
 

3235
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:40,550
gas fee it's over 200
average 222 high 222. that's not i mean

3236
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:40,560
average 222 high 222. that's not i mean
 

3237
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,350
average 222 high 222. that's not i mean
if

3238
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:41,360

01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,510
the way that d5 is talked about
it's a replacement for this out-of-date

3242
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:45,520
it's a replacement for this out-of-date
 

3243
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,750
it's a replacement for this out-of-date
banking system that's not a replacement

3244
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:47,760
banking system that's not a replacement
 

3245
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,270
banking system that's not a replacement
for any kind of banking system that's

01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,189
for any kind of banking system that's
something that's not sustainable

3248
01:12:51,189 --> 01:12:51,199
something that's not sustainable
 

3249
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:53,189
something that's not sustainable
on everscale it's

3250
01:12:53,189 --> 01:12:53,199
on everscale it's
 

3251
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,110
on everscale it's
200 less so

3252
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:55,120
200 less so
 

3253
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,790
200 less so
that's something that people can

3254
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:56,800
that's something that people can
 

3255
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,030
that's something that people can
actually work with

3256
01:12:59,030 --> 01:12:59,040
actually work with
 

3257
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,550
actually work with
so our solution flat cube

3258
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:02,560
so our solution flat cube
 

3259
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,709
so our solution flat cube
total value uh locked into the platform

3260
01:13:04,709 --> 01:13:04,719
total value uh locked into the platform
 

3261
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,750
total value uh locked into the platform

close to 3 million
 

3269
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,550
close to 3 million
and then the highest apr we got is uh

3270
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:18,560
and then the highest apr we got is uh
 

3271
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,070
and then the highest apr we got is uh
uh most recently 113 percent um which is

3272
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:22,080
uh most recently 113 percent um which is
 

3273
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,669
uh most recently 113 percent um which is
huge uh

we have faith in it and that's why we

3344
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:35,840
we have faith in it and that's why we
 

3345
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,189
we have faith in it and that's why we
make it open source and not a lot of

3349
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:42,070

in terms of the auditing we've been

3350
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:42,080
in terms of the auditing we've been
 

3351
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,669
in terms of the auditing we've been
audited a number of times um and that's

3352
01:14:45,669 --> 01:14:45,679
audited a number of times um and that's
 

3353
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:47,430
audited a number of times um and that's
uh something that still goes on because

3354
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:47,440
uh something that still goes on because
 

3355
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,070
uh something that still goes on because
it you know you don't just get audited

3356
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:50,080
it you know you don't just get audited
 

3357
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,070
it you know you don't just get audited
once you don't get um

as we get more people we have to be to

3362
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:56,640
as we get more people we have to be to

as we get more people we have to be to
know that we can handle um the bigger

know that we can handle um the bigger
 

3365
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,709
know that we can handle um the bigger
workload and so that's a constant

we've made videos uh all explaining how
 

3395
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,310
we've made videos uh all explaining how
this works and all trying to smooth

they're a bit out of date here um but

3418
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:55,600
they're a bit out of date here um but
 

3419
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,110
they're a bit out of date here um but
they're still very high

3420
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:57,120
they're still very high
 

3421
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,550
they're still very high
uh and this was um i think taken a

uh and this was um i think taken a
 

3423
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,110
uh and this was um i think taken a
couple maybe a month ago or so so some

01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:03,120
couple maybe a month ago or so so some
 

3425
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,189

of the statistics here are are out of
 

3427
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:07,750
of the statistics here are are out of
date a little bit but this does give a

3428
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:07,760
date a little bit but this does give a
 

3429
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,750
date a little bit but this does give a
good uh representation of the

farming opportunities are very very

3434
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:13,920
farming opportunities are very very
 

3435
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,350

healthy the pools are very healthy we

3436
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:15,360
healthy the pools are very healthy we
 

3437
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,270
healthy the pools are very healthy we
have a lot of people participating in it

3438

have a lot of people participating in it
 

3439
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,270
have a lot of people participating in it
um and then they get rewards

3440
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:19,280
um and then they get rewards
 

3441
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,709
um and then they get rewards
in uh through our vesting system

3442

and organize swaps with other assets
 

3475
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,750
and organize swaps with other assets
and then also create their own farming

3476

how the the platform is going to change
 

3559
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,189
how the the platform is going to change
if you want to see a change or if

3560
01:18:37,189 --> 01:18:37,199
if you want to see a change or if

someone else brings a proposal that you

3562
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:38,560
someone else brings a proposal that you
 

3563
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,630
someone else brings a proposal that you
agree with you stake your cube you vote

3564
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:40,640
agree with you stake your cube you vote
 

3565
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,149
agree with you stake your cube you vote
on it and then the platform can change

3566
01:18:42,149 --> 01:18:42,159
on it and then the platform can change
 

3567
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:45,510
on it and then the platform can change
if it gets enough uh get enough votes

3568
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:45,520
if it gets enough uh get enough votes
 

3569
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,550
if it gets enough uh get enough votes
um

3570
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:46,560
um
 

3571
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,630
um
then you can also stake your cube to to

3572
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:48,640
then you can also stake your cube to to
 

3573
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,990
then you can also stake your cube to to
get rewards uh you're rewarded for

3574
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:52,000
get rewards uh you're rewarded for
 

3575
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,750
get rewards uh you're rewarded for
boosting the liquidity of the platform

3576
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:55,760
boosting the liquidity of the platform
 

3577
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,110
boosting the liquidity of the platform
uh so and up here you can see the uh the

3578
01:18:59,110 --> 01:18:59,120
uh so and up here you can see the uh the
 

3579
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,470
uh so and up here you can see the uh the

distribution of the cube token and then
 

3583
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,110
distribution of the cube token and then
the dow monthly emissions um this stuff

3584
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:05,120
the dow monthly emissions um this stuff
 

3585
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,430
the dow monthly emissions um this stuff
you can check out uh on your own i don't

quite quite a number of stuff is going
 

4031
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,910
quite quite a number of stuff is going
on actually so there

4032
01:27:33,910 --> 01:27:33,920
on actually so there
 

4033
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,750
on actually so there
and then uh there's been a lot of talk

4034
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:35,760
and then uh there's been a lot of talk
 

4035
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,830
and then uh there's been a lot of talk
about how well suited everscale is for

4036
01:27:37,830 --> 01:27:37,840
about how well suited everscale is for
 

4037
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,910
about how well suited everscale is for
gamify and metaverse projects why is

4038
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:39,920
gamify and metaverse projects why is
 

4039
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,750
gamify and metaverse projects why is
that the case what makes everscale the

4040
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:41,760
that the case what makes everscale the
 

4041
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,270
that the case what makes everscale the
ideal blockchain for those kinds of

4042
01:27:43,270 --> 01:27:43,280
ideal blockchain for those kinds of
 

4043
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:46,550
ideal blockchain for those kinds of
projects um actually uh the answer is

4044
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:46,560
projects um actually uh the answer is
 

4045
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,790
projects um actually uh the answer is
just if you have a look at the recent uh

4046
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:48,800
just if you have a look at the recent uh
 

4047
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,189
just if you have a look at the recent uh
incidents that networks experienced with

4048
01:27:51,189 --> 01:27:51,199
incidents that networks experienced with
 

4049
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:52,950
incidents that networks experienced with
launching such a gamified project like

4050
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:52,960
launching such a gamified project like
 

4051
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,830
launching such a gamified project like
steppen uh or before cryptokitties if

4052
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:55,840
steppen uh or before cryptokitties if
 

4053
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,870
steppen uh or before cryptokitties if
you remember it so what went uh

4054
01:27:58,870 --> 01:27:58,880
you remember it so what went uh
 

4055
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,350
you remember it so what went uh
not really well for ethereum uh so

4056
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:01,360
not really well for ethereum uh so
 

4057
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,189
not really well for ethereum uh so
actually every scale thanks to infinite

4058
01:28:03,189 --> 01:28:03,199
actually every scale thanks to infinite
 

4059
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:06,229
actually every scale thanks to infinite
sharding so it's capable uh to scale uh

4060
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:06,239
sharding so it's capable uh to scale uh
 

4061
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,870
sharding so it's capable uh to scale uh
momentarily to withstand the workload

4062
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:08,880
momentarily to withstand the workload
 

4063
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,390
momentarily to withstand the workload
that it's required

4064
01:28:10,390 --> 01:28:10,400
that it's required
 

4065
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,470
that it's required
and currently so uh

4066
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:12,480
and currently so uh
 

4067
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:15,189
and currently so uh
no game has generated the workload

4068
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:15,199
no game has generated the workload
 

4069
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:17,750
no game has generated the workload
that's never scale is not capable to to

4070
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:17,760
that's never scale is not capable to to
 

4071
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,110
that's never scale is not capable to to
do with

4072
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:19,120
do with
 

4073
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,110
do with
yeah i would just add uh i mean people

4074
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,120
yeah i would just add uh i mean people
 

4075
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,030
yeah i would just add uh i mean people
talk about uh or have talked about

4076
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:23,040
talk about uh or have talked about
 

4077
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,510
talk about uh or have talked about
solana as the ethereum killer or as the

4078
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:25,520
solana as the ethereum killer or as the
 

4079
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:28,629
solana as the ethereum killer or as the
solution to ethereum um because it was

4080
01:28:28,629 --> 01:28:28,639
solution to ethereum um because it was
 

4081
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:30,629
solution to ethereum um because it was
going to be able to handle more uh

4082
01:28:30,629 --> 01:28:30,639
going to be able to handle more uh
 

4083
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:32,790
going to be able to handle more uh
transactions a higher load but then uh

4084
01:28:32,790 --> 01:28:32,800
transactions a higher load but then uh
 

4085
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,550
transactions a higher load but then uh
people started migrating to solana and

4086
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:34,560
people started migrating to solana and
 

4087
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,110
people started migrating to solana and
solana's down all the time now so uh it

4088
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:37,120
solana's down all the time now so uh it
 

4089
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,750
solana's down all the time now so uh it
doesn't really work out um that way uh

4090
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:39,760
doesn't really work out um that way uh
 

4091
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,590
doesn't really work out um that way uh
that i don't think they're capable of

4092
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:41,600
that i don't think they're capable of
 

4093
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,669
that i don't think they're capable of
taking on not just them but a lot of

4094
01:28:43,669 --> 01:28:43,679
taking on not just them but a lot of
 

4095
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:45,590
taking on not just them but a lot of
these networks are not capable of taking

4096
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:45,600
these networks are not capable of taking
 

4097
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:46,870
these networks are not capable of taking
on that kind of load because they're not

4098
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:46,880
on that kind of load because they're not
 

4099
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:51,910
on that kind of load because they're not
built the same way but

4100
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:51,920

 

4101
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,189

um

4102
01:28:53,189 --> 01:28:53,199
um
 

4103
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:54,790
um
can you list three killer features of

4104
01:28:54,790 --> 01:28:54,800
can you list three killer features of
 

4105
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,390
can you list three killer features of
your project that make it ahead of

4106
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:56,400
your project that make it ahead of
 

4107
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,310
your project that make it ahead of
competitors what are the competitive

competitors what are the competitive
 

4109
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,310
competitors what are the competitive
advantage that you feel most confident

4110
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:00,320
advantage that you feel most confident
 

4111
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,990
advantage that you feel most confident
about

um
 

4115
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,790
um
i would say maybe it's it's not

4116
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:04,800
i would say maybe it's it's not
 

4117
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:07,350
i would say maybe it's it's not
something sericular features so actually

4118
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:07,360
something sericular features so actually
 

4119
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,870
something sericular features so actually
this is the whole philosophy that we

4120
01:29:08,870 --> 01:29:08,880
this is the whole philosophy that we
 

4121
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:13,030
this is the whole philosophy that we
preach and so we first really uh well

4122
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:13,040
preach and so we first really uh well
 

4123
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:16,390
preach and so we first really uh well
study what people need so we uh take

4124
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:16,400
study what people need so we uh take
 

4125
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,750
study what people need so we uh take
careful uh

4126
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:17,760
careful uh

4128
01:29:20,149 --> 01:29:20,159
customer research and look what other
 

4129
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:21,590
customer research and look what other
others are doing so what challenges

4130
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:21,600
others are doing so what challenges
 

4131
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,790
others are doing so what challenges
they're facing

4132
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:22,800
they're facing
 

4133
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,790
they're facing
uh after that we think

4134
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:24,800
uh after that we think
 

4135
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,070
uh after that we think
so uh think of how we can uh overcome

4136
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:28,080
so uh think of how we can uh overcome
 

4137
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,510
so uh think of how we can uh overcome
those limitations that are causing the

4138
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:29,520
those limitations that are causing the
 

4139
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,189
those limitations that are causing the
problems now and

4140
01:29:31,189 --> 01:29:31,199
problems now and
 

4141
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,550
problems now and
also we think about the problems that

4142
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:32,560
also we think about the problems that
 

4143
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,270
also we think about the problems that
may arise in future so uh just to give

4144
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:35,280
may arise in future so uh just to give
 

4145
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,669
may arise in future so uh just to give
you an example so as a recent you may

4146
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:37,679

um that uh a number of hacks of d5

4152
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:45,360
um that uh a number of hacks of d5
 

4153
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,590
um that uh a number of hacks of d5
platforms has drastically increased over

4154
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:47,600
platforms has drastically increased over
 

4155
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:51,110
platforms has drastically increased over
over the last uh few months so and the

4156
01:29:51,110 --> 01:29:51,120
over the last uh few months so and the
 

4157
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:53,189
over the last uh few months so and the
first uh obvious target for them are

4158
01:29:53,189 --> 01:29:53,199
first uh obvious target for them are
 

4159
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:55,830
first uh obvious target for them are
bridges because uh bridges contain a lot

4160
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:55,840
bridges because uh bridges contain a lot
 

4161
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,750
bridges because uh bridges contain a lot
of liquidity on the walls

4162
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:57,760
of liquidity on the walls
 

4163
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,669
of liquidity on the walls
and uh they are

4164
01:29:59,669 --> 01:29:59,679
and uh they are
 

4165
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:00,790
and uh they are
such

4166
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:00,800
such
 

4167
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:04,229
such
really rich targets for hackers

4168
01:30:04,229 --> 01:30:04,239
really rich targets for hackers
 

4169
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:05,669
really rich targets for hackers
but

4170
01:30:05,669 --> 01:30:05,679
but
 

4171
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:07,590
but
in the architectures that we are

4172
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:07,600
in the architectures that we are
 

4173
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,110
in the architectures that we are
developing security is on the first

4174
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:09,120
developing security is on the first
 

4175
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,990
developing security is on the first
place actually so when we try to think

4176
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:12,000
place actually so when we try to think
 

4177
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,030
place actually so when we try to think
of any possible scenario how the hacker

4178
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:15,040
of any possible scenario how the hacker
 

4179
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,070
of any possible scenario how the hacker
can

4180
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:16,080
can
 

4181
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,470
can
try to break in into the bridge and how

4182
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:18,480
try to break in into the bridge and how
 

4183
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,709
try to break in into the bridge and how
we will make the funds secure

4184
01:30:20,709 --> 01:30:20,719
we will make the funds secure
 

4185
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:23,270
we will make the funds secure
so and that's pretty pretty much

4186
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:23,280
so and that's pretty pretty much
 

4187
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:26,390
so and that's pretty pretty much
the approach as we preach across all of

4188
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:26,400
the approach as we preach across all of
 

4189
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:29,430
the approach as we preach across all of
our development the first try to think a

4190
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:29,440
our development the first try to think a
 

4191
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:30,950
our development the first try to think a
few steps ahead

4192
01:30:30,950 --> 01:30:30,960
few steps ahead
 

4193
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:33,110
few steps ahead
before we're doing something so we make

4194
01:30:33,110 --> 01:30:33,120
before we're doing something so we make
 

4195
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:36,629
before we're doing something so we make
the reliable systems and uh they may not

4196
01:30:36,629 --> 01:30:36,639
the reliable systems and uh they may not
 

4197
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:39,510
the reliable systems and uh they may not
be the fastest in development like us

4198
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:39,520
be the fastest in development like us
 

4199
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,030
be the fastest in development like us
because a lot of projects are doing

4200
01:30:41,030 --> 01:30:41,040
because a lot of projects are doing
 

4201
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:41,990
because a lot of projects are doing
faster

4202
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:42,000
faster
 

4203
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,990
faster
that's true but

4204
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:44,000
that's true but
 

4205
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,149
that's true but
then they suffer so and

4206
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:46,159
then they suffer so and
 

4207
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:48,470
then they suffer so and
we are developing on a bit slower pace

4208
01:30:48,470 --> 01:30:48,480
we are developing on a bit slower pace
 

4209
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:51,910
we are developing on a bit slower pace
but we're trying to build solutions that

4210
01:30:51,910 --> 01:30:51,920
but we're trying to build solutions that
 

4211
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:55,270
but we're trying to build solutions that
uh are really really uh expensive to

4212
01:30:55,270 --> 01:30:55,280
uh are really really uh expensive to
 

4213
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:56,629
uh are really really uh expensive to
hack so

4214
01:30:56,629 --> 01:30:56,639
hack so
 

4215
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:00,390
hack so
no reason to do this

4216
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:00,400

 

4217
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,870

do you have any plans to migrate uh to

4218
01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:02,880
do you have any plans to migrate uh to
 

4219
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,629
do you have any plans to migrate uh to
other chains

4220
01:31:04,629 --> 01:31:04,639
other chains
 

4221
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:05,910
other chains
um

4222
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:05,920
um
 

4223
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,750
um
probably the question is about adding

4224
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:07,760
probably the question is about adding
 

4225
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,750
probably the question is about adding
new chains yeah i think uh

4226
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:09,760
new chains yeah i think uh
 

4227
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,830
new chains yeah i think uh
yeah so we have actually plans and uh

4228
01:31:11,830 --> 01:31:11,840
yeah so we have actually plans and uh
 

4229
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,830
yeah so we have actually plans and uh
the commercial strategy for the octus

4230
01:31:13,830 --> 01:31:13,840
the commercial strategy for the octus
 

4231
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:17,270
the commercial strategy for the octus
bridge for example is adding the most

4232
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:17,280
bridge for example is adding the most
 

4233
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,750
bridge for example is adding the most
valuable chains uh to connect between

4234
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:19,760
valuable chains uh to connect between
 

4235
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,910
valuable chains uh to connect between
each other so there is absolutely no

4236
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:21,920
each other so there is absolutely no
 

4237
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:23,910
each other so there is absolutely no
reason for us to

4238
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:23,920
reason for us to
 

4239
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,310
reason for us to
roll up to i don't know some minor chain

4240
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:26,320
roll up to i don't know some minor chain
 

4241
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:27,750
roll up to i don't know some minor chain
where there are no developers no

4242
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:27,760
where there are no developers no
 

4243
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:30,390
where there are no developers no
development activity and those ones were

4244
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:30,400
development activity and those ones were
 

4245
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,750
development activity and those ones were
selected uh actually because they had a

4246
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:33,760
selected uh actually because they had a
 

4247
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,590
selected uh actually because they had a
lot of developer activity going on a lot

4248
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:35,600
lot of developer activity going on a lot
 

4249
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,590
lot of developer activity going on a lot
of liquidity a lot of interesting

4250
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:37,600
of liquidity a lot of interesting
 

4251
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,430
of liquidity a lot of interesting
projects that uh

4252
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:39,440
projects that uh
 

4253
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,990
projects that uh
sooner or later phase limitation of the

4254
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:42,000
sooner or later phase limitation of the
 

4255
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,470
sooner or later phase limitation of the
homegrown network and then they need to

4256
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:44,480
homegrown network and then they need to
 

4257
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:47,750
homegrown network and then they need to
scale to other audiences so and so forth

4258
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:47,760
scale to other audiences so and so forth
 

4259
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,189
scale to other audiences so and so forth
and as i showed uh on the slides uh

4260
01:31:51,189 --> 01:31:51,199
and as i showed uh on the slides uh
 

4261
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:53,669
and as i showed uh on the slides uh
devoted to uh connectivity and to cross

4262
01:31:53,669 --> 01:31:53,679
devoted to uh connectivity and to cross
 

4263
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:55,830
devoted to uh connectivity and to cross
chain actually i strongly believe that

4264
01:31:55,830 --> 01:31:55,840
chain actually i strongly believe that
 

4265
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,270
chain actually i strongly believe that
the cross chain is the future because uh

4266
01:31:59,270 --> 01:31:59,280
the cross chain is the future because uh
 

4267
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,030
the cross chain is the future because uh
of course there is always a preference

4268
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:01,040
of course there is always a preference
 

4269
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,830
of course there is always a preference
for developers so some someone likes

4270
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:03,840
for developers so some someone likes
 

4271
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,750
for developers so some someone likes
rust someone likes solidity someone

4272
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:05,760
rust someone likes solidity someone
 

4273
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,709
rust someone likes solidity someone
likes ethereum another one like sneer

4274
01:32:08,709 --> 01:32:08,719
likes ethereum another one like sneer
 

4275
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:12,070
likes ethereum another one like sneer
but in general so if they find the uh

4276
01:32:12,070 --> 01:32:12,080
but in general so if they find the uh
 

4277
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:14,629
but in general so if they find the uh
fit between the

4278
01:32:14,629 --> 01:32:14,639
fit between the
 

4279
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:16,629
fit between the
the the proposals that they are doing

4280
01:32:16,629 --> 01:32:16,639
the the proposals that they are doing
 

4281
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:19,350
the the proposals that they are doing
and the customer needs uh sooner or

4282
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:19,360
and the customer needs uh sooner or
 

4283
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,430
and the customer needs uh sooner or
later they will need to grow and they

4284
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:21,440
later they will need to grow and they
 

4285
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:25,110
later they will need to grow and they
will be standing actually and um

4286
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:25,120
will be standing actually and um
 

4287
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,470
will be standing actually and um
the architecture of october's bridge

4288
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:26,480
the architecture of october's bridge
 

4289
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:29,750
the architecture of october's bridge
allows to deploy the bridge in a new uh

4290
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:29,760
allows to deploy the bridge in a new uh
 

4291
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,550
allows to deploy the bridge in a new uh
evm network within a day

evm network within a day
 

4293
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,790
evm network within a day
but there's absolutely no reason for us

4294
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:34,800
but there's absolutely no reason for us
 

4295
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:38,709
but there's absolutely no reason for us
to do this until we fully cover all

4296
01:32:38,709 --> 01:32:38,719
to do this until we fully cover all
 

4297
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:49,110
to do this until we fully cover all
those networks that's already in place

4298
01:32:49,110 --> 01:32:49,120

 

4299
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:53,189

no more no more uh

uh it's currently in progress so um

4308
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:03,360
uh it's currently in progress so um
 

4309
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,669
uh it's currently in progress so um
within a couple of months i think

4310
01:33:05,669 --> 01:33:05,679
within a couple of months i think
 

4311
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:08,470
within a couple of months i think
so uh actually this is something

4312
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:08,480
so uh actually this is something
 

4313
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,270
so uh actually this is something
what

4314
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:09,280
what
 

4315
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,669
what
metamask did so when a lot of our

4316
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:11,679
metamask did so when a lot of our
 

4317
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:13,990
metamask did so when a lot of our
customers were asking us to add a

4318
01:33:13,990 --> 01:33:14,000
customers were asking us to add a
 

4319
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,950
customers were asking us to add a
display of nfts but the main

4320
01:33:16,950 --> 01:33:16,960
display of nfts but the main
 

4321
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,430
display of nfts but the main
reason why it took so long uh here is

4322
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:19,440
reason why it took so long uh here is
 

4323
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:20,390
reason why it took so long uh here is
because

4324
01:33:20,390 --> 01:33:20,400
because
 

4325
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,709
because
our wallet now is infrastructure product

4326
01:33:22,709 --> 01:33:22,719
our wallet now is infrastructure product
 

4327
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:24,790
our wallet now is infrastructure product
actually so it's not a customer product

4328
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:24,800
actually so it's not a customer product
 

4329
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:25,830
actually so it's not a customer product
uh

4330
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:25,840
uh
 

4331
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,229
uh
this and uh we need to think

4332
01:33:28,229 --> 01:33:28,239
this and uh we need to think
 

4333
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:31,590
this and uh we need to think
a bit uh far far beyond uh

4334
01:33:31,590 --> 01:33:31,600
a bit uh far far beyond uh
 

4335
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,669
a bit uh far far beyond uh
of what will be going on and what how

4336
01:33:33,669 --> 01:33:33,679
of what will be going on and what how
 

4337
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:36,390
of what will be going on and what how
the our wallet will be evolving actually

4338
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:36,400
the our wallet will be evolving actually
 

4339
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,110
the our wallet will be evolving actually
and uh nft displaying uh

4340
01:33:39,110 --> 01:33:39,120
and uh nft displaying uh
 

4341
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:41,350
and uh nft displaying uh
is just one of the features that uh

4342
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:41,360
is just one of the features that uh
 

4343
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,070
is just one of the features that uh
constantly added to the error wallet so

4344
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:44,080
constantly added to the error wallet so
 

4345
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:47,110
constantly added to the error wallet so
also we will we have the network scanner

4346
01:33:47,110 --> 01:33:47,120
also we will we have the network scanner
 

4347
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:50,550
also we will we have the network scanner
called everscan so everscan.yeah

4348
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:50,560
called everscan so everscan.yeah
 

4349
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,709
called everscan so everscan.yeah
it will also contain

4350
01:33:52,709 --> 01:33:52,719
it will also contain
 

4351
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:55,910
it will also contain
the possibility of viewing nfts and not

4352
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:55,920
the possibility of viewing nfts and not
 

4353
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,870
the possibility of viewing nfts and not
only pictures contained in nfts but

4354
01:33:58,870 --> 01:33:58,880
only pictures contained in nfts but
 

4355
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,350
only pictures contained in nfts but
as i said so all the other stuff like

4356
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:01,360
as i said so all the other stuff like
 

4357
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,030
as i said so all the other stuff like
metaverse regions

4358
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:03,040
metaverse regions
 

4359
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:05,030
metaverse regions
inventory

4360
01:34:05,030 --> 01:34:05,040
inventory
 

4361
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,110
inventory
i don't know what else so a lot of stuff

4362
01:34:07,110 --> 01:34:07,120
i don't know what else so a lot of stuff
 

4363
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:09,430
i don't know what else so a lot of stuff
so as it will be that

4364
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:09,440
so as it will be that
 

4365
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,430
so as it will be that
um another question sorry i'm new to the

4366
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:11,440
um another question sorry i'm new to the
 

4367
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:13,350
um another question sorry i'm new to the
ever to ever scale

4368
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:13,360
ever to ever scale
 

4369
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,990
ever to ever scale
uh like sorry

4370
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:16,000
uh like sorry
 

4371
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,870
uh like sorry
no welcome uh daniel um what is the

4372
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:18,880
no welcome uh daniel um what is the
 

4373
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:22,149
no welcome uh daniel um what is the
benefit for me to become a relayer

4374
01:34:22,149 --> 01:34:22,159
benefit for me to become a relayer
 

4375
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:23,030
benefit for me to become a relayer
uh

4376
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:23,040
uh
 

4377
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:25,510
uh
relayer is uh okay so

4378
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:25,520
relayer is uh okay so
 

4379
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:28,390
relayer is uh okay so
on never scale so uh you have validators

4380
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:28,400
on never scale so uh you have validators
 

4381
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,629
on never scale so uh you have validators
so validator gets the reward

4382
01:34:30,629 --> 01:34:30,639
so validator gets the reward
 

4383
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:32,790
so validator gets the reward
for validating the network obviously so

4384
01:34:32,790 --> 01:34:32,800
for validating the network obviously so
 

4385
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,910
for validating the network obviously so
it's something like gives you

4386
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:35,920
it's something like gives you
 

4387
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:40,229
it's something like gives you
annualized something like 11 percent

4388
01:34:40,229 --> 01:34:40,239
annualized something like 11 percent
 

4389
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:41,189
annualized something like 11 percent
or so

4390
01:34:41,189 --> 01:34:41,199
or so
 

4391
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:43,750
or so
and uh for october's breach so we also

4392
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:43,760
and uh for october's breach so we also
 

4393
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:47,030
and uh for october's breach so we also
have those validators sculpture layers

4394
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:47,040
have those validators sculpture layers
 

4395
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,510
have those validators sculpture layers
so actually real layers and it's very

4396
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:49,520
so actually real layers and it's very
 

4397
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,350
so actually real layers and it's very
important to look into the tokenomics of

4398
01:34:51,350 --> 01:34:51,360
important to look into the tokenomics of
 

4399
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:53,109
important to look into the tokenomics of
the bridge in this case our layers get

4400
01:34:53,109 --> 01:34:53,119
the bridge in this case our layers get
 

4401
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:55,510
the bridge in this case our layers get
the half of all the rewards that bridge

4402
01:34:55,510 --> 01:34:55,520
the half of all the rewards that bridge
 

4403
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,870
the half of all the rewards that bridge
has generated

4404
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:56,880
has generated
 

4405
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:00,310
has generated
and as the layer number is limited so uh

4406
01:35:00,310 --> 01:35:00,320
and as the layer number is limited so uh
 

4407
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,070
and as the layer number is limited so uh
you can imagine that they're

4408
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:02,080
you can imagine that they're
 

4409
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,229
you can imagine that they're
making uh much more money than the

4410
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:04,239
making uh much more money than the
 

4411
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:06,629
making uh much more money than the
regularistic stakeholder although you

4412
01:35:06,629 --> 01:35:06,639
regularistic stakeholder although you
 

4413
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:09,430
regularistic stakeholder although you
can use your bridge tokens to stake

4414
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:09,440
can use your bridge tokens to stake
 

4415
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,870
can use your bridge tokens to stake
on the bridge to get a part of reward

4416
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:12,880
on the bridge to get a part of reward
 

4417
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,430
on the bridge to get a part of reward
so but to be relayer it's it's quite

4418
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:15,440
so but to be relayer it's it's quite
 

4419
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:18,070
so but to be relayer it's it's quite
expensive so it's a hundred thousand uh

4420
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:18,080
expensive so it's a hundred thousand uh
 

4421
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,030
expensive so it's a hundred thousand uh
bridge tokens which is uh something like

4422
01:35:21,030 --> 01:35:21,040
bridge tokens which is uh something like
 

4423
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,910
bridge tokens which is uh something like
half a million dollars uh nowadays and

4424
01:35:23,910 --> 01:35:23,920
half a million dollars uh nowadays and
 

4425
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,590
half a million dollars uh nowadays and
uh

4426
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:25,600
uh
 

4427
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,270
uh
that's why we are carefully selecting

4428
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:27,280
that's why we are carefully selecting
 

4429
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,750
that's why we are carefully selecting
the layers

4430
01:35:29,750 --> 01:35:29,760
the layers
 

4431
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:32,229
the layers
that will add not only money but also

4432
01:35:32,229 --> 01:35:32,239
that will add not only money but also
 

4433
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:33,990
that will add not only money but also
the value and the reputation to the

4434
01:35:33,990 --> 01:35:34,000
the value and the reputation to the
 

4435
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,189
the value and the reputation to the
bridge itself

4436
01:35:35,189 --> 01:35:35,199
bridge itself
 

4437
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:36,950
bridge itself
that's why we are constantly in in a

4438
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:36,960
that's why we are constantly in in a
 

4439
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,590
that's why we are constantly in in a
discussion with big liquidity providers

4440
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:39,600
discussion with big liquidity providers
 

4441
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,709
discussion with big liquidity providers
with a

4442
01:35:40,709 --> 01:35:40,719
with a
 

4443
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:44,229
with a
big and noticeable market players so who

4444
01:35:44,229 --> 01:35:44,239
big and noticeable market players so who
 

4445
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:47,669
big and noticeable market players so who
will be happy to see on the list

4446
01:35:47,669 --> 01:35:47,679
will be happy to see on the list
 

4447
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:48,870
will be happy to see on the list
but also relayer is a great

4448
01:35:48,870 --> 01:35:48,880
but also relayer is a great
 

4449
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,870
but also relayer is a great
responsibility and you really need to

4450
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:50,880
responsibility and you really need to
 

4451
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,270
responsibility and you really need to
take uh to make sure that you have that

4452
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:53,280
take uh to make sure that you have that
 

4453
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:56,950
take uh to make sure that you have that
your hardware to run the re-layer

4454
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:56,960
your hardware to run the re-layer
 

4455
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:01,109
your hardware to run the re-layer
and good internet connection

4456
01:36:01,109 --> 01:36:01,119

 

4457
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:02,229

yeah so

4458
01:36:02,229 --> 01:36:02,239
yeah so
 

4459
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:05,109
yeah so
for you uh for for error layer so it's

4460
01:36:05,109 --> 01:36:05,119
for you uh for for error layer so it's
 

4461
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:08,709
for you uh for for error layer so it's
of course not only about being

4462
01:36:08,709 --> 01:36:08,719
of course not only about being
 

4463
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:10,870
of course not only about being
money generating stream but it's also

4464
01:36:10,870 --> 01:36:10,880
money generating stream but it's also
 

4465
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,790
money generating stream but it's also
about the reputation so because we

4466
01:36:12,790 --> 01:36:12,800
about the reputation so because we
 

4467
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,950
about the reputation so because we
position bridge as a really secure

4468
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:14,960
position bridge as a really secure
 

4469
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,790
position bridge as a really secure
cross-chain transfer uh

4470
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:16,800
cross-chain transfer uh
 

4471
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,950
cross-chain transfer uh
tool

4472
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:18,960
tool
 

4473
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:21,830
tool
everscale is cool but not uh still not

4474
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:21,840
everscale is cool but not uh still not
 

4475
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,750
everscale is cool but not uh still not
well-known blockchain so how do you plan

4476
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:23,760
well-known blockchain so how do you plan
 

4477
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:25,830
well-known blockchain so how do you plan
to get more exposure

4478
01:36:25,830 --> 01:36:25,840
to get more exposure
 

4479
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,830
to get more exposure
actually that's what i said

4480
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:27,840
actually that's what i said
 

4481
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,030
actually that's what i said
so we have started the

4482
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:31,040
so we have started the
 

4483
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:32,310
so we have started the
first

4484
01:36:32,310 --> 01:36:32,320
first
 

4485
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,950
first

few months have passed but we already
 

4491
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,390
few months have passed but we already
see a lot of gaining gaining from that

4492
01:36:42,390 --> 01:36:42,400
see a lot of gaining gaining from that
 

4493
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:43,990
see a lot of gaining gaining from that
region a lot of grossing in the

4494
01:36:43,990 --> 01:36:44,000
region a lot of grossing in the
 

4495
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,189
region a lot of grossing in the
community

community
 

4497
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:48,149
community
uh so and in asian regions so we focus

4498
01:36:48,149 --> 01:36:48,159
uh so and in asian regions so we focus
 

4499
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:50,790
uh so and in asian regions so we focus
now on south korea and indonesia but we

4500
01:36:50,790 --> 01:36:50,800
now on south korea and indonesia but we
 

4501
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,390
now on south korea and indonesia but we
haven't planned

4502
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:52,400
haven't planned
 

4503
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,870
haven't planned
additional marketing campaigns in japan

4504
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:54,880
additional marketing campaigns in japan
 

4505
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:59,590
additional marketing campaigns in japan
and

and also planning to expand furthermore

4510
01:37:04,149 --> 01:37:04,159
and also planning to expand furthermore
 

4511
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:05,990
and also planning to expand furthermore
across the world so now we are testing a

4512
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:06,000
across the world so now we are testing a
 

4513
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,470
across the world so now we are testing a
lot of different hypotheses uh the

4514
01:37:08,470 --> 01:37:08,480
lot of different hypotheses uh the
 

4515
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,310
lot of different hypotheses uh the
product fits

4516
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:10,320
product fits
 

4517
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,550
product fits
so try to look into the messages that

4518
01:37:12,550 --> 01:37:12,560
so try to look into the messages that
 

4519
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,149
so try to look into the messages that
are really appealing to people

4520
01:37:14,149 --> 01:37:14,159
are really appealing to people
 

4521
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:16,070
are really appealing to people
especially nowadays during the crypto

4522
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:16,080
especially nowadays during the crypto
 

4523
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,990
especially nowadays during the crypto
winter when everyone is down so

4524
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:18,000
winter when everyone is down so
 

4525
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,870
winter when everyone is down so
everybody's set so we need to somehow

4526
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:20,880
everybody's set so we need to somehow
 

4527
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:21,750
everybody's set so we need to somehow
find

4528
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:21,760
find
 

4529
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:25,030
find
this right words for people

4530
01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:25,040
this right words for people
 

4531
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:28,310
this right words for people
um next question uh what are

4532
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:28,320
um next question uh what are
 

4533
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,550
um next question uh what are
cross chain oracles

4534
01:37:30,550 --> 01:37:30,560
cross chain oracles
 

4535
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,229
cross chain oracles
crossing oracles is

4536
01:37:32,229 --> 01:37:32,239
crossing oracles is
 

4537
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:34,629
crossing oracles is
a concept that we are currently uh

4538
01:37:34,629 --> 01:37:34,639
a concept that we are currently uh
 

4539
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:38,470
a concept that we are currently uh
developing so it's it's in r d stage

4540
01:37:38,470 --> 01:37:38,480
developing so it's it's in r d stage
 

4541
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,910
developing so it's it's in r d stage
um actually what uh

4542
01:37:41,910 --> 01:37:41,920
um actually what uh
 

4543
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:44,390
um actually what uh
bridge does so it actually listens all

4544
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:44,400
bridge does so it actually listens all
 

4545
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:47,109
bridge does so it actually listens all
the networks that it's connected to and

4546
01:37:47,109 --> 01:37:47,119
the networks that it's connected to and
 

4547
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:49,590
the networks that it's connected to and
this way uh layer nodes can also operate

4548
01:37:49,590 --> 01:37:49,600
this way uh layer nodes can also operate
 

4549
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,030
this way uh layer nodes can also operate
like oracles

4550
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:51,040
like oracles
 

4551
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,270
like oracles
because you can subscribe to certain

4552
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:53,280
because you can subscribe to certain
 

4553
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:56,149
because you can subscribe to certain
data that you need to transfer

4554
01:37:56,149 --> 01:37:56,159
data that you need to transfer
 

4555
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:58,310
data that you need to transfer
to get from different chains and this

4556
01:37:58,310 --> 01:37:58,320
to get from different chains and this
 

4557
01:37:58,320 --> 01:37:59,590
to get from different chains and this
way

4558
01:37:59,590 --> 01:37:59,600
way
 

4559
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,350
way
bridge serves as a

4560
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:01,360
bridge serves as a
 

4561
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:04,070
bridge serves as a
ultimate decentralized oracle

4562
01:38:04,070 --> 01:38:04,080
ultimate decentralized oracle
 

4563
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,070
ultimate decentralized oracle
but

4564
01:38:06,070 --> 01:38:06,080
but
 

4565
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:07,910
but
as we clearly understand how much

4566
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:07,920
as we clearly understand how much
 

4567
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,590
as we clearly understand how much
responsibility it will

4568
01:38:09,590 --> 01:38:09,600
responsibility it will
 

4569
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:10,709
responsibility it will
put on us

4570
01:38:10,709 --> 01:38:10,719
put on us
 

4571
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:12,709
put on us
we first want to

4572
01:38:12,709 --> 01:38:12,719
we first want to
 

4573
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:13,750
we first want to
carefully

4574
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:13,760
carefully
 

4575
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,270
carefully
look into how everything works for

4576
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:15,280
look into how everything works for
 

4577
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:17,270
look into how everything works for
example in chain link and all the other

4578
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:17,280
example in chain link and all the other
 

4579
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,709
example in chain link and all the other
oracles

4580
01:38:18,709 --> 01:38:18,719
oracles
 

4581
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:19,669
oracles
and

4582
01:38:19,669 --> 01:38:19,679
and
 

4583
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:22,550
and
propose the system that will

4584
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:22,560
propose the system that will
 

4585
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,750
propose the system that will
deliver the reliable on chain data for

4586
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:25,760
deliver the reliable on chain data for
 

4587
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:28,149
deliver the reliable on chain data for
the needs not only of users but also for

4588
01:38:28,149 --> 01:38:28,159
the needs not only of users but also for
 

4589
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:30,790
the needs not only of users but also for
the apps and uh different smart

4590
01:38:30,790 --> 01:38:30,800
the apps and uh different smart
 

4591
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:33,430
the apps and uh different smart
contracts applications and

4592
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:33,440
contracts applications and
 

4593
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,990
contracts applications and
this is not an easy task but

4594
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:36,000
this is not an easy task but
 

4595
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,189
this is not an easy task but
we it's

4596
01:38:37,189 --> 01:38:37,199
we it's
 

4597
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:39,350
we it's
prioritizing our roadmap so i hope that

4598
01:38:39,350 --> 01:38:39,360
prioritizing our roadmap so i hope that
 

4599
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:41,750
prioritizing our roadmap so i hope that
we'll see some kind of mvp

we'll see some kind of mvp
 

4601
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,629
we'll see some kind of mvp
this year

4602
01:38:44,629 --> 01:38:44,639
this year
 

4603
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:45,910
this year
are there any more

you could give us an update on any uh
 

4615
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:06,070
you could give us an update on any uh
road map achievements

4616
01:39:06,070 --> 01:39:06,080
road map achievements
 

4617
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:08,870
road map achievements
uh yeah uh actually really

4618
01:39:08,870 --> 01:39:08,880
uh yeah uh actually really
 

4619
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:12,070
uh yeah uh actually really
not not not long ago so we have released

4620
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:12,080
not not not long ago so we have released
 

4621
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:14,070
not not not long ago so we have released
one of the biggest

4622
01:39:14,070 --> 01:39:14,080
one of the biggest
 

4623
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,229
one of the biggest
updates for the breach recently it's

4624
01:39:16,229 --> 01:39:16,239
updates for the breach recently it's
 

4625
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:17,750
updates for the breach recently it's
called the merge

4626
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:17,760
called the merge
 

4627
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:20,310
called the merge
and what it does so it's works in

4628
01:39:20,310 --> 01:39:20,320
and what it does so it's works in
 

4629
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:22,229
and what it does so it's works in
junction with a

4630
01:39:22,229 --> 01:39:22,239
junction with a
 

4631
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:25,109
junction with a
universal bridge technology so universal

4632
01:39:25,109 --> 01:39:25,119
universal bridge technology so universal
 

4633
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:28,229
universal bridge technology so universal
bridge lets you uh transfer any token to

4634
01:39:28,229 --> 01:39:28,239
bridge lets you uh transfer any token to
 

4635
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:29,590
bridge lets you uh transfer any token to
any other network for example if you

4636
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:29,600
any other network for example if you
 

4637
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:31,750
any other network for example if you
have a token on i don't know an

4638
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:31,760
have a token on i don't know an
 

4639
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:34,550
have a token on i don't know an
avalanche and you need to get it on bnb

4640
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:34,560
avalanche and you need to get it on bnb
 

4641
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:37,590
avalanche and you need to get it on bnb
uh so you can uh already now transfer it

4642
01:39:37,590 --> 01:39:37,600
uh so you can uh already now transfer it
 

4643
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,070
uh so you can uh already now transfer it
without any limitation meaning that we

4644
01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:40,080
without any limitation meaning that we
 

4645
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,750
without any limitation meaning that we
support all tokens

4646
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:41,760
support all tokens
 

4647
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,790
support all tokens
uh but you will get the

4648
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:44,800
uh but you will get the
 

4649
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:48,149
uh but you will get the
robbed token with a prefix oct

4650
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:48,159
robbed token with a prefix oct
 

4651
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:49,990
robbed token with a prefix oct
for octus

4652
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:50,000
for octus
 

4653
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,229
for octus
in the target network and for just

4654
01:39:52,229 --> 01:39:52,239
in the target network and for just
 

4655
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:54,950
in the target network and for just
imagine if you have uh your own tokens

4656
01:39:54,950 --> 01:39:54,960
imagine if you have uh your own tokens
 

4657
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,990
imagine if you have uh your own tokens
already on different networks um

4658
01:39:57,990 --> 01:39:58,000
already on different networks um
 

4659
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,430
already on different networks um
and you want

4660
01:39:59,430 --> 01:39:59,440
and you want
 

4661
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:02,390
and you want
them to easily convert to one another so

4662
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:02,400
them to easily convert to one another so
 

4663
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,470
them to easily convert to one another so
that's where the merged technology uh

4664
01:40:04,470 --> 01:40:04,480
that's where the merged technology uh
 

4665
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,870
that's where the merged technology uh
comes in place so it allows you to

4666
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:06,880
comes in place so it allows you to
 

4667
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,229
comes in place so it allows you to
indicate the specific uh tokens in

4668
01:40:10,229 --> 01:40:10,239
indicate the specific uh tokens in
 

4669
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:12,310
indicate the specific uh tokens in
different networks that are basically

4670
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:12,320
different networks that are basically
 

4671
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:14,709
different networks that are basically
the same so for example if you have

4672
01:40:14,709 --> 01:40:14,719
the same so for example if you have
 

4673
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:15,910
the same so for example if you have
tether

4674
01:40:15,910 --> 01:40:15,920
tether
 

4675
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:19,750
tether
on ethereum and on solana uh so this is

4676
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:19,760
on ethereum and on solana uh so this is
 

4677
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,310
on ethereum and on solana uh so this is
pretty much the same tether yeah so just

4678
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:22,320
pretty much the same tether yeah so just
 

4679
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,149
pretty much the same tether yeah so just
of course there are some peculiarities

4680
01:40:24,149 --> 01:40:24,159
of course there are some peculiarities
 

4681
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:26,390
of course there are some peculiarities
but basically this is the same

4682
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:26,400
but basically this is the same
 

4683
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,870
but basically this is the same
entity issuing it and uh

4684
01:40:28,870 --> 01:40:28,880
entity issuing it and uh
 

4685
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:30,709
entity issuing it and uh
you want to indicate that it is the same

4686
01:40:30,709 --> 01:40:30,719
you want to indicate that it is the same
 

4687
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:34,629
you want to indicate that it is the same
token and in this case um it works a bit

4688
01:40:34,629 --> 01:40:34,639
token and in this case um it works a bit
 

4689
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:37,590
token and in this case um it works a bit
differently so uh for universal bridge

4690
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:37,600
differently so uh for universal bridge
 

4691
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:40,470
differently so uh for universal bridge
tokens so how it works you actually have

4692
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:40,480
tokens so how it works you actually have
 

4693
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:43,189
tokens so how it works you actually have
the one input stream so with your tokens

4694
01:40:43,189 --> 01:40:43,199
the one input stream so with your tokens
 

4695
01:40:43,199 --> 01:40:44,390
the one input stream so with your tokens
that are

4696
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:44,400
that are
 

4697
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:47,189
that are
put on the world in one network and then

4698
01:40:47,189 --> 01:40:47,199
put on the world in one network and then
 

4699
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:49,030
put on the world in one network and then
it is a bridge who controls the emission

4700
01:40:49,030 --> 01:40:49,040
it is a bridge who controls the emission
 

4701
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:50,950
it is a bridge who controls the emission
of this derivative some other tokens so

4702
01:40:50,950 --> 01:40:50,960
of this derivative some other tokens so
 

4703
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,390
of this derivative some other tokens so
on the other network

4704
01:40:52,390 --> 01:40:52,400
on the other network
 

4705
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,709
on the other network
but for the merge tokens so actually

4706
01:40:54,709 --> 01:40:54,719
but for the merge tokens so actually
 

4707
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:58,070
but for the merge tokens so actually
there is a new configuration in it that

4708
01:40:58,070 --> 01:40:58,080
there is a new configuration in it that
 

4709
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:01,030
there is a new configuration in it that
indicates the link between tokens and

4710
01:41:01,030 --> 01:41:01,040
indicates the link between tokens and
 

4711
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:03,669
indicates the link between tokens and
now you will be able to uh

4712
01:41:03,669 --> 01:41:03,679
now you will be able to uh
 

4713
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:05,990
now you will be able to uh
withdraw tokens on the target network

4714
01:41:05,990 --> 01:41:06,000
withdraw tokens on the target network
 

4715
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,430
withdraw tokens on the target network
only if they are contained in that world

4716
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:09,440
only if they are contained in that world
 

4717
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,830
only if they are contained in that world
at the end of the line

4718
01:41:11,830 --> 01:41:11,840
at the end of the line
 

4719
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,910
at the end of the line
and this technology is is really

4720
01:41:13,910 --> 01:41:13,920
and this technology is is really
 

4721
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,990
and this technology is is really
interesting and cool because uh it will

4722
01:41:15,990 --> 01:41:16,000
interesting and cool because uh it will
 

4723
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,310
interesting and cool because uh it will
allow uh projects actually to control

4724
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:18,320
allow uh projects actually to control
 

4725
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,070
allow uh projects actually to control
the emission from one place

4726
01:41:20,070 --> 01:41:20,080
the emission from one place
 

4727
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:22,390
the emission from one place
for example if you have

4728
01:41:22,390 --> 01:41:22,400
for example if you have
 

4729
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,830
for example if you have
some

4730
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:23,840
some
 

4731
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,109
some
some dao

4732
01:41:25,109 --> 01:41:25,119
some dao
 

4733
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:27,590
some dao
deployed in in any other network so that

4734
01:41:27,590 --> 01:41:27,600
deployed in in any other network so that
 

4735
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,350
deployed in in any other network so that
is controlling the

4736
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:29,360
is controlling the
 

4737
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:32,229
is controlling the
the token so you can issue enough tokens

4738
01:41:32,229 --> 01:41:32,239
the token so you can issue enough tokens
 

4739
01:41:32,239 --> 01:41:34,310
the token so you can issue enough tokens
and rebalance them between networks

4740
01:41:34,310 --> 01:41:34,320
and rebalance them between networks
 

4741
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:35,270
and rebalance them between networks
uh

4742
01:41:35,270 --> 01:41:35,280
uh
 

4743
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:38,070
uh
there is a new feature coming soon so uh

4744
01:41:38,070 --> 01:41:38,080
there is a new feature coming soon so uh
 

4745
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:40,470
there is a new feature coming soon so uh
we have quite a lot of updates coming uh

4746
01:41:40,470 --> 01:41:40,480
we have quite a lot of updates coming uh
 

4747
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,709
we have quite a lot of updates coming uh
with the pro prominence solana

4748
01:41:42,709 --> 01:41:42,719
with the pro prominence solana
 

4749
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:46,149
with the pro prominence solana
integration um so um

4750
01:41:46,149 --> 01:41:46,159
integration um so um
 

4751
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:47,590
integration um so um
if we uh

4752
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:47,600
if we uh
 

4753
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:50,070
if we uh
get on time so uh we will also add the

4754
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:50,080
get on time so uh we will also add the
 

4755
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,950
get on time so uh we will also add the
possibility to uh universal uh smart

4756
01:41:52,950 --> 01:41:52,960
possibility to uh universal uh smart
 

4757
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:55,030
possibility to uh universal uh smart
calls transferred between any other

4758
01:41:55,030 --> 01:41:55,040
calls transferred between any other
 

4759
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,590
calls transferred between any other
chain so meaning that you can call on 1d

4760
01:41:57,590 --> 01:41:57,600
chain so meaning that you can call on 1d
 

4761
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,990
chain so meaning that you can call on 1d
app in one chain the smart contract in

4762
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:00,000
app in one chain the smart contract in
 

4763
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,629
app in one chain the smart contract in
total another chain so it creates such a

4764
01:42:02,629 --> 01:42:02,639
total another chain so it creates such a
 

4765
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:04,790
total another chain so it creates such a
tremendous amount of opportunities for

4766
01:42:04,790 --> 01:42:04,800
tremendous amount of opportunities for
 

4767
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,070
tremendous amount of opportunities for
you

4768
01:42:06,070 --> 01:42:06,080
you
 

4769
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,990
you
i'm not sure if it will release in this

4770
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:08,000
i'm not sure if it will release in this
 

4771
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,750
i'm not sure if it will release in this
specific release but it will definitely

4772
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:09,760
specific release but it will definitely
 

4773
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,750
specific release but it will definitely
come

4774
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:11,760
come
 

4775
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:12,830
come
and of

4776
01:42:12,830 --> 01:42:12,840
and of
 

4777
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:15,270
and of
course we

4778
01:42:15,270 --> 01:42:15,280
course we
 

4779
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:16,790
course we
are constantly working on improving the

4780
01:42:16,790 --> 01:42:16,800
are constantly working on improving the
 

4781
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:19,510
are constantly working on improving the
security so and uh

4782
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:19,520
security so and uh
 

4783
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:21,430
security so and uh
there are quite a lot of improvements

4784
01:42:21,430 --> 01:42:21,440
there are quite a lot of improvements
 

4785
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,390
there are quite a lot of improvements
that

4786
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:22,400
that
 

4787
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:23,590
that
are not

4788
01:42:23,590 --> 01:42:23,600
are not
 

4789
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:24,709
are not
well

4790
01:42:24,709 --> 01:42:24,719
well
 

4791
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:27,189
well
interesting for a common user but

4792
01:42:27,189 --> 01:42:27,199
interesting for a common user but
 

4793
01:42:27,199 --> 01:42:29,109
interesting for a common user but
they are sounds really

4794
01:42:29,109 --> 01:42:29,119
they are sounds really
 

4795
01:42:29,119 --> 01:42:30,870
they are sounds really
important for developers

4796
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:30,880
important for developers
 

4797
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,229
important for developers
so uh

4798
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:32,239
so uh
 

4799
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:35,270
so uh
we have also recently uh

4800
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:35,280
we have also recently uh
 

4801
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,510
we have also recently uh
added

4802
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:37,520
added
 

4803
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:39,910
added
a whole bunch of documentation

4804
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:39,920
a whole bunch of documentation
 

4805
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,070
a whole bunch of documentation
about the octus bridge to make it easier

4806
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:42,080
about the octus bridge to make it easier
 

4807
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:44,709
about the octus bridge to make it easier
to integrate with

4808
01:42:44,709 --> 01:42:44,719
to integrate with
 

4809
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:47,030
to integrate with
okay so enough walk to the bridge

4810
01:42:47,030 --> 01:42:47,040
okay so enough walk to the bridge
 

4811
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,629
okay so enough walk to the bridge
for the flat cube for example we have

4812
01:42:48,629 --> 01:42:48,639
for the flat cube for example we have
 

4813
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:50,390
for the flat cube for example we have
recently added a

4814
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:50,400
recently added a
 

4815
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,669
recently added a
stable curve

4816
01:42:51,669 --> 01:42:51,679
stable curve
 

4817
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:54,310
stable curve
to to our decks meaning that you can now

4818
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:54,320
to to our decks meaning that you can now
 

4819
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:59,990
to to our decks meaning that you can now
deploy uh pool liquidity pool with a

4820
01:42:59,990 --> 01:43:00,000
deploy uh pool liquidity pool with a
 

4821
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,870
deploy uh pool liquidity pool with a
curve pretty similar to what

4822
01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:02,880
curve pretty similar to what
 

4823
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:05,590
curve pretty similar to what
curve does the girth project does so

4824
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:05,600
curve does the girth project does so
 

4825
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,189
curve does the girth project does so
means that you can

4826
01:43:07,189 --> 01:43:07,199
means that you can
 

4827
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:09,750
means that you can
swap stable coins with a really slow

4828
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:09,760
swap stable coins with a really slow
 

4829
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:13,990
swap stable coins with a really slow
slippage uh almost zero um and it was

4830
01:43:13,990 --> 01:43:14,000
slippage uh almost zero um and it was
 

4831
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,470
slippage uh almost zero um and it was
something that was so so badly needed on

4832
01:43:16,470 --> 01:43:16,480
something that was so so badly needed on
 

4833
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,189
something that was so so badly needed on
the scale and now we are working also on

4834
01:43:19,189 --> 01:43:19,199
the scale and now we are working also on
 

4835
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:21,750
the scale and now we are working also on
the triples uh

4836
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:21,760
the triples uh
 

4837
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,350
the triples uh
meaning that you can have liquid pools

4838
01:43:23,350 --> 01:43:23,360
meaning that you can have liquid pools
 

4839
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:25,830
meaning that you can have liquid pools
with multiple tokens

4840
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:25,840
with multiple tokens
 

4841
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:26,870
with multiple tokens
yeah so

4842
01:43:26,870 --> 01:43:26,880
yeah so
 

4843
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,950

so

5022

so
 

5023
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,469
so
but in this time currently all program

5024
02:18:52,469 --> 02:18:52,479
but in this time currently all program
 

5025
02:18:52,479 --> 02:18:55,589
but in this time currently all program
is most threat

5026
02:18:55,589 --> 02:18:55,599

 

5027
02:18:55,599 --> 02:18:58,150

i think music trading it's a future for

5028
02:18:58,150 --> 02:18:58,160
i think music trading it's a future for
 

5029
02:18:58,160 --> 02:19:00,230
i think music trading it's a future for
blockchain and for every scale it's

5030
02:19:00,230 --> 02:19:00,240
blockchain and for every scale it's
 

5031
02:19:00,240 --> 02:19:02,790
blockchain and for every scale it's
already done

5032
02:19:02,790 --> 02:19:02,800
already done
 

5033
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:05,750
already done
you still have dynamic sharding

5034
02:19:05,750 --> 02:19:05,760
you still have dynamic sharding
 

5035
02:19:05,760 --> 02:19:08,389
you still have dynamic sharding
it means we increase threshold count if

5036
02:19:08,389 --> 02:19:08,399
it means we increase threshold count if
 

5037
02:19:08,399 --> 02:19:11,509
it means we increase threshold count if
we have load network and merge it back

5038
02:19:11,509 --> 02:19:11,519
we have load network and merge it back
 

5039
02:19:11,519 --> 02:19:14,070
we have load network and merge it back
if it's done

5040
02:19:14,070 --> 02:19:14,080
if it's done
 

5041
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:15,190
if it's done
so

5042
02:19:15,190 --> 02:19:15,200
so
 

5043
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:17,030
so
next feature is severe scale it's paid

5044
02:19:17,030 --> 02:19:17,040

addresses or
 

5185
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:55,750
addresses or
maybe the status was frozen and

5186
02:21:55,750 --> 02:21:55,760
maybe the status was frozen and
 

5187
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:57,030
maybe the status was frozen and
destroyed

02:21:57,030 --> 02:21:57,040
destroyed
 

5189
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:58,389
destroyed
so frozen

5190
02:21:58,389 --> 02:21:58,399
so frozen
 

5191
02:21:58,399 --> 02:22:00,389
so frozen
it's about paid storage if we deploy a

5192
02:22:00,389 --> 02:22:00,399
it's about paid storage if we deploy a
 

5193
02:22:00,399 --> 02:22:03,110
it's about paid storage if we deploy a
smart contract and don't pay it uh

5194
02:22:03,110 --> 02:22:03,120
smart contract and don't pay it uh
 

5195
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:06,870
smart contract and don't pay it uh
fee yes and if this contract

5196
02:22:06,870 --> 02:22:06,880
fee yes and if this contract
 

5197
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:09,590
fee yes and if this contract
uh this country will be freezing frozen

5198
02:22:09,590 --> 02:22:09,600
uh this country will be freezing frozen
 

5199
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:10,710
uh this country will be freezing frozen
um

5200
02:22:10,710 --> 02:22:10,720
um
 

5201
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:12,870
um
frozen contract to store

5202
02:22:12,870 --> 02:22:12,880

two years as i know but every scale is

5204
02:22:15,990 --> 02:22:16,000
two years as i know but every scale is
 

5205
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,630
two years as i know but every scale is
new network and i know only

5206
02:22:18,630 --> 02:22:18,640
new network and i know only
 

5207
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:21,030
new network and i know only
several cases when small contract was

5208
02:22:21,030 --> 02:22:21,040
several cases when small contract was
 

5209
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:24,309
several cases when small contract was
frozen we cannot throw them contract we

5210
02:22:24,309 --> 02:22:24,319
frozen we cannot throw them contract we
 

5211
02:22:24,319 --> 02:22:26,230
frozen we cannot throw them contract we
have this procedure but

5212
02:22:26,230 --> 02:22:26,240
have this procedure but
 

5213
02:22:26,240 --> 02:22:28,710
have this procedure but
it's don't use it

5214
02:22:28,710 --> 02:22:28,720
it's don't use it
 

5215
02:22:28,720 --> 02:22:29,830
it's don't use it
often

5216
02:22:29,830 --> 02:22:29,840
often
 

5217
02:22:29,840 --> 02:22:31,910
often
so an active active smart contract is

5218
02:22:31,910 --> 02:22:31,920
so an active active smart contract is
 

5219
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:33,990
so an active active smart contract is
one contract that we can execute

5220
02:22:33,990 --> 02:22:34,000
one contract that we can execute
 

5221
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:35,190
one contract that we can execute
right now

5222
02:22:35,190 --> 02:22:35,200
right now
 

5223
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:37,190
right now
so

5224
02:22:37,190 --> 02:22:37,200
so
 

5225
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:39,190
so
what about asynchronic material of every

5226
02:22:39,190 --> 02:22:39,200
what about asynchronic material of every
 

5227
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:40,309
what about asynchronic material of every
scale

5228
02:22:40,309 --> 02:22:40,319
scale
 

5229
02:22:40,319 --> 02:22:43,190
scale
it's a big part and most important part

5230
02:22:43,190 --> 02:22:43,200
it's a big part and most important part
 

5231
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:45,670
it's a big part and most important part
for developers so

5232
02:22:45,670 --> 02:22:45,680
for developers so
 

5233
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:48,469
for developers so
let's see

5234
02:22:48,469 --> 02:22:48,479

so uh what's the problem with this uh

5332
02:24:42,950 --> 02:24:42,960
so uh what's the problem with this uh
 

5333
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:44,870
so uh what's the problem with this uh

uh first difficult to calculate gas fee

5336
02:24:48,550 --> 02:24:48,560
uh first difficult to calculate gas fee
 

5337
02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:51,510
uh first difficult to calculate gas fee
uh we have a long chain uh every message

5338
02:24:51,510 --> 02:24:51,520
uh we have a long chain uh every message
 

5339
02:24:51,520 --> 02:24:54,309
uh we have a long chain uh every message

so

5350
02:25:03,429 --> 02:25:03,439
so
 

5351
02:25:03,439 --> 02:25:06,230
so
we can't calculate how many errors you

5352
02:25:06,230 --> 02:25:06,240
we can't calculate how many errors you
 

5353
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:08,389
we can't calculate how many errors you

uh usually we use uh

5360
02:25:15,110 --> 02:25:15,120
uh usually we use uh
 

5361
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:17,270
uh usually we use uh
usually we take more errors that i

5362
02:25:17,270 --> 02:25:17,280
usually we take more errors that i
 

5363
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:19,590

5366
02:25:22,469 --> 02:25:22,479

5367
02:25:22,479 --> 02:25:24,950
prediction how many errors you can use
we can use maybe i don't know we need to

5368
02:25:24,950 --> 02:25:24,960
we can use maybe i don't know we need to
 

5369
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:26,630
we can use maybe i don't know we need to
use two errors for

5370
02:25:26,630 --> 02:25:26,640
use two errors for
 

5371
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:30,150
use two errors for
all chain but users send five flavors

5372
02:25:30,150 --> 02:25:30,160
all chain but users send five flavors
 

5373
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:31,750
all chain but users send five flavors
and we

5374
02:25:31,750 --> 02:25:31,760
and we
 

5375
02:25:31,760 --> 02:25:35,110
and we
return change uh when

5376
02:25:35,110 --> 02:25:35,120
return change uh when
 

5377
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:38,070
return change uh when
transaction chains is chain inspected

5378
02:25:38,070 --> 02:25:38,080
transaction chains is chain inspected
 

5379
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:40,070
transaction chains is chain inspected
so

5380
02:25:40,070 --> 02:25:40,080
so
 

5381
02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:43,590
so
uh save a second problem uh if we have a

5382
02:25:43,590 --> 02:25:43,600
uh save a second problem uh if we have a
 

5383
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:46,150
uh save a second problem uh if we have a

02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:11,190

but it's hard for development

5408
02:26:11,190 --> 02:26:11,200
but it's hard for development
 

5409
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:13,750
but it's hard for development
we can use callback message

5410
02:26:13,750 --> 02:26:13,760
we can use callback message
 

5411
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:16,870
we can use callback message
we can use many different uh

development
 

5425
02:26:31,120 --> 02:26:33,190
development
when you

5426
02:26:33,190 --> 02:26:33,200
when you
 

5427
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:35,110
when you
uh when you deploy smart contract you

5428
02:26:35,110 --> 02:26:35,120
uh when you deploy smart contract you
 

5429
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:39,110
uh when you deploy smart contract you
need to think how it will be

5430
02:26:39,110 --> 02:26:39,120
need to think how it will be
 

5431
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:41,429
need to think how it will be
how it will be used and

5432
02:26:41,429 --> 02:26:41,439
how it will be used and
 

5433
02:26:41,439 --> 02:26:44,550
how it will be used and
what you will be do if something

5434
02:26:44,550 --> 02:26:44,560
what you will be do if something
 

5435
02:26:44,560 --> 02:26:45,910

02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:56,710
think about it when you develop a smart
contract

5506
02:27:56,710 --> 02:27:56,720

 

5507
02:27:56,720 --> 02:28:00,389

so what about paid storage uh as i say

5508
02:28:00,389 --> 02:28:00,399
so what about paid storage uh as i say
 

5509
02:28:00,399 --> 02:28:01,349
so what about paid storage uh as i say
uh

5510
02:28:01,349 --> 02:28:01,359
uh
 

5511
02:28:01,359 --> 02:28:03,830
uh
smart contracts uh

5512
02:28:03,830 --> 02:28:03,840
smart contracts uh
 

5513
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:05,990
smart contracts uh
pay a storage sphere

5514
02:28:05,990 --> 02:28:06,000
pay a storage sphere
 

5515
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,389
pay a storage sphere
we can calculate how many storage fee we

5516
02:28:08,389 --> 02:28:08,399
we can calculate how many storage fee we
 

5517
02:28:08,399 --> 02:28:11,830
we can calculate how many storage fee we
will pay it one year to year or or

5518
02:28:11,830 --> 02:28:11,840
will pay it one year to year or or
 

5519
02:28:11,840 --> 02:28:13,429
will pay it one year to year or or
on different period

5520
02:28:13,429 --> 02:28:13,439
on different period
 

5521
02:28:13,439 --> 02:28:16,070
on different period
but

5522
02:28:16,070 --> 02:28:16,080

 

5523
02:28:16,080 --> 02:28:17,590

if of course if

5524
02:28:17,590 --> 02:28:17,600
if of course if
 

5525
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:19,349
if of course if
storage speed not changed

5526
02:28:19,349 --> 02:28:19,359
storage speed not changed
 

5527
02:28:19,359 --> 02:28:20,710
storage speed not changed
for network

5528
02:28:20,710 --> 02:28:20,720
for network
 

5529
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:22,469
for network
so

5530
02:28:22,469 --> 02:28:22,479
so
 

5531
02:28:22,479 --> 02:28:24,230
so
and when we

5532
02:28:24,230 --> 02:28:24,240
and when we
 

5533
02:28:24,240 --> 02:28:27,590
and when we
deploy a smart contract every time we

5534
02:28:27,590 --> 02:28:27,600
deploy a smart contract every time we
 

5535
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:29,590
deploy a smart contract every time we
store a

5536
02:28:29,590 --> 02:28:29,600
store a
 

5537
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:32,389
store a
part of adders on smart contract

5538
02:28:32,389 --> 02:28:32,399
part of adders on smart contract
 

5539
02:28:32,399 --> 02:28:33,510
part of adders on smart contract
addresses

5540
02:28:33,510 --> 02:28:33,520
addresses
 

5541
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:35,110
addresses
for storage sphere

5542
02:28:35,110 --> 02:28:35,120
for storage sphere
 

5543
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:37,349
for storage sphere
because storage fee

5544
02:28:37,349 --> 02:28:37,359
because storage fee
 

5545
02:28:37,359 --> 02:28:39,110
because storage fee
is changeable

5546
02:28:39,110 --> 02:28:39,120
is changeable
 

5547
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:41,429
is changeable
not directly it's changeable

5548
02:28:41,429 --> 02:28:41,439
not directly it's changeable
 

5549
02:28:41,439 --> 02:28:43,190
not directly it's changeable
chargeable every time when smart

5550
02:28:43,190 --> 02:28:43,200
chargeable every time when smart
 

5551
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:48,150
chargeable every time when smart
contract executed

5552
02:28:48,150 --> 02:28:48,160

 

5553
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:49,270

but

5554
02:28:49,270 --> 02:28:49,280
but
 

5555
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:51,510
but
good practice if you don't use the smart

5556
02:28:51,510 --> 02:28:51,520
good practice if you don't use the smart
 

5557
02:28:51,520 --> 02:28:54,070
good practice if you don't use the smart
contract you will destroy it and take

5558
02:28:54,070 --> 02:28:54,080
contract you will destroy it and take
 

5559
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:55,110
contract you will destroy it and take
back

5560
02:28:55,110 --> 02:28:55,120
back
 

5561
02:28:55,120 --> 02:29:00,469
back
errors that stored on the smart contract

5562
02:29:00,469 --> 02:29:00,479

 

5563
02:29:00,479 --> 02:29:01,670

okay

5564
02:29:01,670 --> 02:29:01,680
okay
 

5565
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:04,070
okay
i think all you need to know is this

5566
02:29:04,070 --> 02:29:04,080
i think all you need to know is this
 

5567
02:29:04,080 --> 02:29:05,110
i think all you need to know is this
time

5568
02:29:05,110 --> 02:29:05,120
time
 

5569
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:06,469
time
when you deploy a smart contract you

5570
02:29:06,469 --> 02:29:06,479
when you deploy a smart contract you
 

5571
02:29:06,479 --> 02:29:08,550
when you deploy a smart contract you
need to

5572
02:29:08,550 --> 02:29:08,560
need to
 

5573
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:10,150
need to
you need to send

5574
02:29:10,150 --> 02:29:10,160
you need to send
 

5575
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:13,990
you need to send
a few errors i don't know

5576
02:29:13,990 --> 02:29:14,000

 

5577
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,550

0.1 neighbors or smaller to smart

5578
02:29:16,550 --> 02:29:16,560
0.1 neighbors or smaller to smart
 

5579
02:29:16,560 --> 02:29:18,389
0.1 neighbors or smaller to smart
contract and

5580
02:29:18,389 --> 02:29:18,399
contract and
 

5581
02:29:18,399 --> 02:29:19,990
contract and
it can help to

5582
02:29:19,990 --> 02:29:20,000
it can help to
 

5583
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,550
it can help to
store this contract one year and now

5584
02:29:22,550 --> 02:29:22,560
store this contract one year and now
 

5585
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:24,309
store this contract one year and now
uh for uh

5586
02:29:24,309 --> 02:29:24,319
uh for uh
 

5587
02:29:24,319 --> 02:29:27,349
uh for uh
faculty members we sent sent i think how

5588
02:29:27,349 --> 02:29:27,359
faculty members we sent sent i think how
 

5589
02:29:27,359 --> 02:29:31,030
faculty members we sent sent i think how
to calculate storage team

5590
02:29:31,030 --> 02:29:31,040

 

5591
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:33,990

and uh proof of state validation oh i

5592
02:29:33,990 --> 02:29:34,000
and uh proof of state validation oh i
 

5593
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,710
and uh proof of state validation oh i
don't know what uh what can i say

5594
02:29:36,710 --> 02:29:36,720
don't know what uh what can i say
 

5595
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:38,389
don't know what uh what can i say
more about proof of state

5596
02:29:38,389 --> 02:29:38,399
more about proof of state
 

5597
02:29:38,399 --> 02:29:39,670
more about proof of state
i don't

5598
02:29:39,670 --> 02:29:39,680
i don't
 

5599
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:41,270
i don't
speak about proof of state and proof of

5600
02:29:41,270 --> 02:29:41,280
speak about proof of state and proof of
 

5601
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:43,670
speak about proof of state and proof of
work was different

5602
02:29:43,670 --> 02:29:43,680
work was different
 

5603
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:45,990
work was different
but best

5604
02:29:45,990 --> 02:29:46,000
but best
 

5605
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:49,670
but best
best thing about proof of state it means

5606
02:29:49,670 --> 02:29:49,680
best thing about proof of state it means
 

5607
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:52,469
best thing about proof of state it means
every scale we produce blocks every

5608
02:29:52,469 --> 02:29:52,479
every scale we produce blocks every
 

5609
02:29:52,479 --> 02:29:55,030
every scale we produce blocks every
second

5610
02:29:55,030 --> 02:29:55,040

 

5611
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:58,070

and faster sometimes so it means every

5612
02:29:58,070 --> 02:29:58,080
and faster sometimes so it means every
 

5613
02:29:58,080 --> 02:29:59,670
and faster sometimes so it means every
second when you

5614
02:29:59,670 --> 02:29:59,680
second when you
 

5615
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:01,830
second when you
take a block you know that finalization

5616
02:30:01,830 --> 02:30:01,840
take a block you know that finalization
 

5617
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:03,349
take a block you know that finalization
already done

5618
02:30:03,349 --> 02:30:03,359
already done
 

5619
02:30:03,359 --> 02:30:04,950
already done
this mean you can

5620
02:30:04,950 --> 02:30:04,960
this mean you can
 

5621
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:07,349
this mean you can
use that data for

5622
02:30:07,349 --> 02:30:07,359
use that data for
 

5623
02:30:07,359 --> 02:30:09,030
use that data for
for you for users

5624
02:30:09,030 --> 02:30:09,040
for you for users
 

5625
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:13,670
for you for users
if you buy something or

5626
02:30:13,670 --> 02:30:13,680

 

5627
02:30:13,680 --> 02:30:15,830

you take it

5628
02:30:15,830 --> 02:30:15,840
you take it
 

5629
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:20,389
you take it
when block is reduced

5630
02:30:20,389 --> 02:30:20,399
when block is reduced
 

5631
02:30:20,399 --> 02:30:22,230
when block is reduced
so

5632
02:30:22,230 --> 02:30:22,240
so
 

5633
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:25,429
so
and about shutting technology

5634
02:30:25,429 --> 02:30:25,439
and about shutting technology
 

5635
02:30:25,439 --> 02:30:26,550
and about shutting technology
two years ago

5636
02:30:26,550 --> 02:30:26,560
two years ago
 

5637
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:30,230
two years ago
two weeks ago we have a minimum

02:30:34,399 --> 02:30:37,510
and we
down minimum shards to one

5644
02:30:37,510 --> 02:30:37,520
down minimum shards to one
 

5645
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:38,230
down minimum shards to one
no

5646

no
 

5647
02:30:38,240 --> 02:30:42,469
no
two year to two week goals and it uh

5648
02:30:42,469 --> 02:30:42,479
two year to two week goals and it uh
 

5649
02:30:42,479 --> 02:30:43,510
two year to two week goals and it uh
network

5650
02:30:43,510 --> 02:30:43,520
network
 

5651
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:45,750

02:30:45,750 --> 02:30:45,760
a little faster after it
 

5653
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:47,429
a little faster after it
but

5654
02:30:47,429 --> 02:30:47,439
but
 

5655
02:30:47,439 --> 02:30:49,670
but
if

02:30:55,359 --> 02:30:57,830
all of them want to
to do something in every scale

5662
02:30:57,830 --> 02:30:57,840
to do something in every scale
 

5663
02:30:57,840 --> 02:30:59,110
to do something in every scale
we have

5664
02:30:59,110 --> 02:30:59,120
we have
 

5665
02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:03,429
we have
active sharding technology it means

5666
02:31:03,429 --> 02:31:03,439

 

5667
02:31:03,439 --> 02:31:07,270

and
it's very fast so

5684
02:31:21,590 --> 02:31:21,600
it's very fast so
 

5685
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:22,790
it's very fast so
uh okay

5686
02:31:22,790 --> 02:31:22,800
uh okay
 

5687
02:31:22,800 --> 02:31:24,710
uh okay
when we develop smart contract we need

5688
02:31:24,710 --> 02:31:24,720
when we develop smart contract we need
 

5689
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:26,710
when we develop smart contract we need
to interact with smart contract for you

5690
02:31:26,710 --> 02:31:26,720
to interact with smart contract for you
 

5691
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:29,830
to interact with smart contract for you
from ui ux or

backhand it's maybe a custodial

5696
02:31:33,110 --> 02:31:33,120
backhand it's maybe a custodial
 

5697
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:35,429

non-custodial services
 

5699
02:31:35,439 --> 02:31:38,630
non-custodial services
first you need to use

5700
02:31:38,630 --> 02:31:38,640

 

5701
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:41,270

everscan or airlife it's blockchain

5702
02:31:41,270 --> 02:31:41,280
everscan or airlife it's blockchain
 

5703
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:42,389
everscan or airlife it's blockchain
explorers

5704
02:31:42,389 --> 02:31:42,399
explorers
 

5705
02:31:42,399 --> 02:31:44,469
explorers
it's a different blockchain explorers

5706
02:31:44,469 --> 02:31:44,479
it's a different blockchain explorers
 

5707
02:31:44,479 --> 02:31:48,630
it's a different blockchain explorers
they show one blockchain overscale but

5708
02:31:48,630 --> 02:31:48,640
they show one blockchain overscale but
 

5709
02:31:48,640 --> 02:31:50,870
they show one blockchain overscale but
you can see

5710
02:31:50,870 --> 02:31:50,880
you can see
 

5711
02:31:50,880 --> 02:31:53,510
you can see
but you can work with this

5712
02:31:53,510 --> 02:31:53,520
but you can work with this
 

5713
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:56,469
but you can work with this
explorers use a different protocol for

5714
02:31:56,469 --> 02:31:56,479
explorers use a different protocol for
 

5715
02:31:56,479 --> 02:31:59,510
explorers use a different protocol for
everscan it's rest type it's work fast

5716
02:31:59,510 --> 02:31:59,520
everscan it's rest type it's work fast
 

5717
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:04,150
everscan it's rest type it's work fast
and simple and for every life is graphql

5718
02:32:04,150 --> 02:32:04,160
and simple and for every life is graphql
 

5719
02:32:04,160 --> 02:32:06,070
and simple and for every life is graphql
use graphql you can take more

5720
02:32:06,070 --> 02:32:06,080
use graphql you can take more
 

5721
02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:08,710
use graphql you can take more
information but

5722
02:32:08,710 --> 02:32:08,720
information but
 

5723
02:32:08,720 --> 02:32:11,990
information but
as a graph of data

5724
02:32:11,990 --> 02:32:12,000
as a graph of data
 

5725
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:16,150
as a graph of data
but it's not needed uh often

5726
02:32:16,150 --> 02:32:16,160
but it's not needed uh often
 

5727
02:32:16,160 --> 02:32:18,870
but it's not needed uh often
and you can use

5728
02:32:18,870 --> 02:32:18,880
and you can use
 

5729
02:32:18,880 --> 02:32:20,790
and you can use
products that you that you want

5730
02:32:20,790 --> 02:32:20,800

02:33:43,280 --> 02:33:46,150
job
that one smart smart contract send to

5804
02:33:46,150 --> 02:33:46,160
that one smart smart contract send to
 

5805
02:33:46,160 --> 02:33:48,070
that one smart smart contract send to
another smart contract it's interact

5806
02:33:48,070 --> 02:33:48,080
another smart contract it's interact
 

5807
02:33:48,080 --> 02:33:50,230
another smart contract it's interact
interaction with a between smart

5808
02:33:50,230 --> 02:33:50,240
interaction with a between smart
 

5809
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:51,270
interaction with a between smart
contract

5810
02:33:51,270 --> 02:33:51,280
contract
 

5811
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:53,670
contract
and we have external out messages it's

5812
02:33:53,670 --> 02:33:53,680
and we have external out messages it's
 

5813
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:55,910
and we have external out messages it's
like a log in ethereum

5814
02:33:55,910 --> 02:33:55,920
like a log in ethereum
 

5815
02:33:55,920 --> 02:33:57,270
like a log in ethereum
so

5816
02:33:57,270 --> 02:33:57,280
so
 

5817
02:33:57,280 --> 02:33:59,429
so
external out messages produced smart

5818
02:33:59,429 --> 02:33:59,439
external out messages produced smart
 

5819
02:33:59,439 --> 02:34:02,469
external out messages produced smart
contract but we

5820
02:34:02,469 --> 02:34:02,479
contract but we
 

5821
02:34:02,479 --> 02:34:04,230
contract but we
don't have this nation

5822
02:34:04,230 --> 02:34:04,240
don't have this nation
 

5823
02:34:04,240 --> 02:34:06,469
don't have this nation
so

5824
02:34:06,469 --> 02:34:06,479

 

5825
02:34:06,479 --> 02:34:09,590

when we use messages so when if you want

5826
02:34:09,590 --> 02:34:09,600
when we use messages so when if you want
 

5827
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:12,469
when we use messages so when if you want
to change something in your scale you

5828
02:34:12,469 --> 02:34:12,479
to change something in your scale you
 

5829
02:34:12,479 --> 02:34:15,190
to change something in your scale you
create external in messages

5830
02:34:15,190 --> 02:34:15,200
create external in messages
 

5831
02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:16,870
create external in messages
um you can

5832
02:34:16,870 --> 02:34:16,880
um you can
 

5833
02:34:16,880 --> 02:34:19,830
um you can
read the eternal messages or

5834
02:34:19,830 --> 02:34:19,840
read the eternal messages or
 

5835
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:21,910
read the eternal messages or
but usually don't need it i don't know

5836
02:34:21,910 --> 02:34:21,920
but usually don't need it i don't know
 

5837
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:24,550
but usually don't need it i don't know
no usually it's not needed

5838
02:34:24,550 --> 02:34:24,560

all interaction with smart contract
 

5855
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:46,550
all interaction with smart contract
uh started usually from wallets

5856
02:34:46,550 --> 02:34:46,560

 

5857
02:34:46,560 --> 02:34:49,110

as i say uh

5858
02:34:49,110 --> 02:34:49,120
as i say uh
 

5859
02:34:49,120 --> 02:34:51,030
as i say uh
everything is smart contract you can

5860
02:34:51,030 --> 02:34:51,040
everything is smart contract you can
 

5861
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:54,309
everything is smart contract you can
send errors without a vote

5862
02:34:54,309 --> 02:34:54,319
send errors without a vote
 

5863
02:34:54,319 --> 02:34:56,710
send errors without a vote
and vote is smart contract

5864
02:34:56,710 --> 02:34:56,720
and vote is smart contract
 

5865
02:34:56,720 --> 02:34:58,309
and vote is smart contract
and

5866
02:34:58,309 --> 02:34:58,319
and
 

5867
02:34:58,319 --> 02:35:01,270
and
i think 90 percent of user either scale

5868
02:35:01,270 --> 02:35:01,280
i think 90 percent of user either scale
 

5869
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:03,349
i think 90 percent of user either scale
have multisig wallet because it's a

5870
02:35:03,349 --> 02:35:03,359
have multisig wallet because it's a
 

5871
02:35:03,359 --> 02:35:07,030
have multisig wallet because it's a
standard wallet for every scale

5872
02:35:07,030 --> 02:35:07,040
standard wallet for every scale
 

5873
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:09,349
standard wallet for every scale
and it's it's good because

5874
02:35:09,349 --> 02:35:09,359
and it's it's good because
 

5875
02:35:09,359 --> 02:35:10,550
and it's it's good because
we can

5876
02:35:10,550 --> 02:35:10,560
we can
 

5877
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:11,670
we can
update

5878
02:35:11,670 --> 02:35:11,680
update
 

5879
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:13,670
update
wallet user can update

5880
02:35:13,670 --> 02:35:13,680
wallet user can update
 

5881
02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:15,429
wallet user can update
your own voters for

5882
02:35:15,429 --> 02:35:15,439
your own voters for
 

5883
02:35:15,439 --> 02:35:17,830
your own voters for
other custodials either the

5884
02:35:17,830 --> 02:35:17,840
other custodials either the
 

5885
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:20,469
other custodials either the
new case or change case it's more

5886
02:35:20,469 --> 02:35:20,479
new case or change case it's more
 

5887
02:35:20,479 --> 02:35:22,630
new case or change case it's more

so uh

5896
02:35:31,750 --> 02:35:31,760
so uh
 

5897
02:35:31,760 --> 02:35:34,630
so uh
if i want to interact with blockchain i

5898
02:35:34,630 --> 02:35:34,640
if i want to interact with blockchain i
 

5899
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:37,830
if i want to interact with blockchain i
need to send message to vote

5900
02:35:37,830 --> 02:35:37,840
need to send message to vote
 

5901
02:35:37,840 --> 02:35:39,270

deployed it was after

6062
02:39:10,790 --> 02:39:10,800
deployed it was after
 

6063
02:39:10,800 --> 02:39:14,950
deployed it was after
the ethereum network was released

6064
02:39:14,950 --> 02:39:14,960

 

6065
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:16,870

so when when were

6066
02:39:16,870 --> 02:39:16,880
so when when were
 

6067
02:39:16,880 --> 02:39:18,230

6071
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:25,510

okay if you want to develop smartcon

6072
02:39:25,510 --> 02:39:25,520
okay if you want to develop smartcon
 

6073
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:28,309
okay if you want to develop smartcon
you need to how to deploy it or no when

6074
02:39:28,309 --> 02:39:28,319
you need to how to deploy it or no when
 

6075
02:39:28,319 --> 02:39:30,070
you need to how to deploy it or no when
when was it uh

6076
02:39:30,070 --> 02:39:30,080
when was it uh
 

6077
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:32,550
when was it uh
like it's it's hard it's of course it's

6078
02:39:32,550 --> 02:39:32,560
like it's it's hard it's of course it's
 

6079
02:39:32,560 --> 02:39:35,270
like it's it's hard it's of course it's
uh harder than uh ethereum development

6080
02:39:35,270 --> 02:39:35,280
uh harder than uh ethereum development
 

6081
02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:37,990
uh harder than uh ethereum development
because it's uh we need to think about

6082
02:39:37,990 --> 02:39:38,000
because it's uh we need to think about
 

6083
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:41,190
because it's uh we need to think about
all execution of smart contracts always

how to

6204
02:41:57,349 --> 02:41:57,359
how to
 

6205
02:41:57,359 --> 02:41:59,510
how to
store it how to change it all of them

6206
02:41:59,510 --> 02:41:59,520
store it how to change it all of them
 

6207
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:01,030
store it how to change it all of them
you know

6208
02:42:01,030 --> 02:42:01,040
you know
 

6209
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:03,190
you know
we have solution for all of them

6210
02:42:03,190 --> 02:42:03,200
we have solution for all of them
 

6211
02:42:03,200 --> 02:42:05,510
we have solution for all of them
and so does that give developers more

6212
02:42:05,510 --> 02:42:05,520
and so does that give developers more
 

6213
02:42:05,520 --> 02:42:07,910
and so does that give developers more
flexibility with what they can do

6214
02:42:07,910 --> 02:42:07,920
flexibility with what they can do
 

6215
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:09,990
flexibility with what they can do
is that why ever sk does that add to

6216
02:42:09,990 --> 02:42:10,000
is that why ever sk does that add to
 

6217
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:11,910
is that why ever sk does that add to
like the scalability of everscale that

6218
02:42:11,910 --> 02:42:11,920
like the scalability of everscale that
 

6219
02:42:11,920 --> 02:42:14,309
like the scalability of everscale that
you can kind of adapt it to

6220
02:42:14,309 --> 02:42:14,319
you can kind of adapt it to
 

6221
02:42:14,319 --> 02:42:15,590
you can kind of adapt it to
to other

6222

other needs i guess
 

6227
02:42:18,960 --> 02:42:22,790
other needs i guess
what you got you need for

6228
02:42:22,790 --> 02:42:22,800

it's like uh developing in necro system

6270
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:12,080
it's like uh developing in necro system
 

6271
02:43:12,080 --> 02:43:15,190
it's like uh developing in necro system
uh you have many micro system that uh

6272
02:43:15,190 --> 02:43:15,200
uh you have many micro system that uh
 

6273
02:43:15,200 --> 02:43:17,990
uh you have many micro system that uh
interact together that can send messages

ask the messengers that uh that store
you own data in in her state it's like

6278
02:43:24,150 --> 02:43:24,160
you own data in in her state it's like
 

6279
02:43:24,160 --> 02:43:26,550
you own data in in her state it's like
microsystem if you uh develop

6280
02:43:26,550 --> 02:43:26,560
microsystem if you uh develop
 

6281
02:43:26,560 --> 02:43:29,670
microsystem if you uh develop
microsystem uh it's the same

6282
02:43:29,670 --> 02:43:29,680
microsystem uh it's the same
 

6283
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:30,630
microsystem uh it's the same
i think

6284
02:43:30,630 --> 02:43:30,640
i think
 

6285
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:33,349
i think
oh no no i think it's true it's it's the

6286
02:43:33,349 --> 02:43:33,359
oh no no i think it's true it's it's the
 

6287
02:43:33,359 --> 02:43:34,150
oh no no i think it's true it's it's the
same

6288
02:43:34,150 --> 02:43:34,160
same
 

6289
02:43:34,160 --> 02:43:35,590
same
so uh

6290
02:43:35,590 --> 02:43:35,600
so uh
 

6291
02:43:35,600 --> 02:43:36,870
so uh
in this case

6292
02:43:36,870 --> 02:43:36,880
in this case
 

6293
02:43:36,880 --> 02:43:39,750
in this case
no uh already i say about uh mint one

6294
02:43:39,750 --> 02:43:39,760
no uh already i say about uh mint one
 

6295
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:42,790
no uh already i say about uh mint one

uh this version was
 

6411
02:46:05,680 --> 02:46:08,950
uh this version was
a high value for execution but low value

uh we will test that uh interaction

6420
02:46:19,349 --> 02:46:19,359
uh we will test that uh interaction
 

6421
02:46:19,359 --> 02:46:21,670
uh we will test that uh interaction
interaction with between the chains for

6422
02:46:21,670 --> 02:46:21,680
interaction with between the chains for
 

6423
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:24,230
interaction with between the chains for
example version zero or chain one it's

6424
02:46:24,230 --> 02:46:24,240
example version zero or chain one it's
 

6425
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:26,950
example version zero or chain one it's
different chain it can be different uh

6426
02:46:26,950 --> 02:46:26,960
different chain it can be different uh
 

6427
02:46:26,960 --> 02:46:28,630
different chain it can be different uh
main token

6428
02:46:28,630 --> 02:46:28,640
main token
 

6429
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:31,510
main token
it's not like it's scalability we can

6430
02:46:31,510 --> 02:46:31,520
it's not like it's scalability we can
 

6431
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:33,910
it's not like it's scalability we can
multiply if you if you want

6432
02:46:33,910 --> 02:46:33,920
multiply if you if you want
 

6433
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:36,790
multiply if you if you want
for different case

6434
02:46:36,790 --> 02:46:36,800
for different case
 

6435
02:46:36,800 --> 02:46:39,349
for different case
yeah so basically uh evm workchain is

6436
02:46:39,349 --> 02:46:39,359
yeah so basically uh evm workchain is
 

6437
02:46:39,359 --> 02:46:41,910
yeah so basically uh evm workchain is
just yet another chain with its own uh

6438
02:46:41,910 --> 02:46:41,920
just yet another chain with its own uh
 

6439
02:46:41,920 --> 02:46:43,510
just yet another chain with its own uh
set of rules

6440
02:46:43,510 --> 02:46:43,520
set of rules
 

6441
02:46:43,520 --> 02:46:45,750
set of rules
so it will uh have the same set of raw

6442
02:46:45,750 --> 02:46:45,760
so it will uh have the same set of raw
 

6443
02:46:45,760 --> 02:46:46,950
so it will uh have the same set of raw
similar to

6444
02:46:46,950 --> 02:46:46,960
similar to
 

6445
02:46:46,960 --> 02:46:49,429
similar to
classic ethereum for example so it's

6446
02:46:49,429 --> 02:46:49,439
classic ethereum for example so it's
 

6447
02:46:49,439 --> 02:46:52,309
classic ethereum for example so it's
having the same virtual machine but

6448
02:46:52,309 --> 02:46:52,319
having the same virtual machine but
 

6449
02:46:52,319 --> 02:46:54,790
having the same virtual machine but
after the transactions and blocks are

6450
02:46:54,790 --> 02:46:54,800
after the transactions and blocks are
 

6451
02:46:54,800 --> 02:46:56,550
after the transactions and blocks are
issued on this worksheet so

6452
02:46:56,550 --> 02:46:56,560
issued on this worksheet so
 

6453
02:46:56,560 --> 02:46:58,790
issued on this worksheet so
uh the final state is written in the

6454
02:46:58,790 --> 02:46:58,800
uh the final state is written in the
 

6455
02:46:58,800 --> 02:47:00,309
uh the final state is written in the
master chain

6456
02:47:00,309 --> 02:47:00,319
master chain
 

6457
02:47:00,319 --> 02:47:01,110
master chain
so

6458
02:47:01,110 --> 02:47:01,120
so
 

6459
02:47:01,120 --> 02:47:03,830
so
it works pretty much like uh well polka

6460
02:47:03,830 --> 02:47:03,840
it works pretty much like uh well polka
 

6461
02:47:03,840 --> 02:47:05,429
it works pretty much like uh well polka
dot should work

6462
02:47:05,429 --> 02:47:05,439
dot should work
 

6463
02:47:05,439 --> 02:47:07,830
dot should work
so actually every scale is the

6464
02:47:07,830 --> 02:47:07,840
so actually every scale is the
 

6465
02:47:07,840 --> 02:47:11,269
so actually every scale is the
polka dot but the real one

6466
02:47:11,269 --> 02:47:11,279
polka dot but the real one
 

6467
02:47:11,279 --> 02:47:16,790
polka dot but the real one
and better we all weight it yes

6468
02:47:16,790 --> 02:47:16,800

 

6469
02:47:16,800 --> 02:47:19,110

but for example in this time when you

6470
02:47:19,110 --> 02:47:19,120
but for example in this time when you
 

6471
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:21,510
but for example in this time when you
use a smart contract we have addresses

6472
02:47:21,510 --> 02:47:21,520
use a smart contract we have addresses
 

6473
02:47:21,520 --> 02:47:23,429
use a smart contract we have addresses
that have two parts it's

6474
02:47:23,429 --> 02:47:23,439
that have two parts it's
 

6475
02:47:23,439 --> 02:47:26,550
that have two parts it's
a blockchain id and address part

6476
02:47:26,550 --> 02:47:26,560
a blockchain id and address part
 

6477
02:47:26,560 --> 02:47:29,110
a blockchain id and address part
and when you program smart contract we

6478
02:47:29,110 --> 02:47:29,120
and when you program smart contract we
 

6479
02:47:29,120 --> 02:47:31,190
and when you program smart contract we
you use zero bar chaining this time but

6480
02:47:31,190 --> 02:47:31,200
you use zero bar chaining this time but
 

6481
02:47:31,200 --> 02:47:32,389
you use zero bar chaining this time but
you can

6482
02:47:32,389 --> 02:47:32,399
you can
 

6483
02:47:32,399 --> 02:47:36,950
you can
and you can set one or two over chain id

6484
02:47:36,950 --> 02:47:36,960

 

6485
02:47:36,960 --> 02:47:40,710

okay

6486
02:47:40,710 --> 02:47:40,720

 

6487
02:47:40,720 --> 02:47:42,870

okay this comes from a programmer that's

6488
02:47:42,870 --> 02:47:42,880
okay this comes from a programmer that's
 

6489
02:47:42,880 --> 02:47:45,990
okay this comes from a programmer that's
not a blockchain programmer but um

6490
02:47:45,990 --> 02:47:46,000
not a blockchain programmer but um
 

6491
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:47,590
not a blockchain programmer but um
because we're using asynchronous

6492
02:47:47,590 --> 02:47:47,600
because we're using asynchronous
 

6493
02:47:47,600 --> 02:47:50,710
because we're using asynchronous
computing here is there a hazard for

6494
02:47:50,710 --> 02:47:50,720
computing here is there a hazard for
 

6495
02:47:50,720 --> 02:47:52,950
computing here is there a hazard for
a double spending thing and if that

6496
02:47:52,950 --> 02:47:52,960
a double spending thing and if that
 

6497
02:47:52,960 --> 02:47:56,630
a double spending thing and if that
happens how do uh

6498
02:47:56,630 --> 02:47:56,640

 

6499
02:47:56,640 --> 02:47:58,309

the validators how do they act when

6500
02:47:58,309 --> 02:47:58,319
the validators how do they act when
 

6501
02:47:58,319 --> 02:47:59,429
the validators how do they act when
something like that happens you know

6502
02:47:59,429 --> 02:47:59,439
something like that happens you know
 

6503
02:47:59,439 --> 02:48:01,269
something like that happens you know
because you have errors non-stop who

6504
02:48:01,269 --> 02:48:01,279
because you have errors non-stop who
 

6505
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:03,110
because you have errors non-stop who
actually pays that fee and something

6506
02:48:03,110 --> 02:48:03,120
actually pays that fee and something
 

6507
02:48:03,120 --> 02:48:04,630
actually pays that fee and something
like that happens and it's been written

6508
02:48:04,630 --> 02:48:04,640
like that happens and it's been written
 

6509
02:48:04,640 --> 02:48:07,269
like that happens and it's been written
on the blockchain already uh how do we

6510
02:48:07,269 --> 02:48:07,279
on the blockchain already uh how do we
 

6511
02:48:07,279 --> 02:48:09,429
on the blockchain already uh how do we
track back to that and actually

6512
02:48:09,429 --> 02:48:09,439
track back to that and actually
 

6513
02:48:09,439 --> 02:48:10,790
track back to that and actually
uh make sure that everything is all

6514
02:48:10,790 --> 02:48:10,800
uh make sure that everything is all
 

6515
02:48:10,800 --> 02:48:11,910
uh make sure that everything is all
right

6516
02:48:11,910 --> 02:48:11,920
right
 

6517
02:48:11,920 --> 02:48:13,830
right
okay well double spending

6518
02:48:13,830 --> 02:48:13,840
okay well double spending
 

6519
02:48:13,840 --> 02:48:15,750
okay well double spending
uh double spending attack hits attack

6520
02:48:15,750 --> 02:48:15,760
uh double spending attack hits attack
 

6521
02:48:15,760 --> 02:48:16,950
uh double spending attack hits attack
when we

6522
02:48:16,950 --> 02:48:16,960
when we
 

6523
02:48:16,960 --> 02:48:18,230
when we
produce

6524
02:48:18,230 --> 02:48:18,240
produce
 

6525
02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:20,309
produce
one message twice and the

6526
02:48:20,309 --> 02:48:20,319
one message twice and the
 

6527
02:48:20,319 --> 02:48:24,309
one message twice and the
user paid twice uh augustine or

6528
02:48:24,309 --> 02:48:24,319
user paid twice uh augustine or
 

6529
02:48:24,319 --> 02:48:26,630
user paid twice uh augustine or
users that send twice

if we talk about programming yes we have

6536
02:48:34,070 --> 02:48:34,080
if we talk about programming yes we have
 

6537
02:48:34,080 --> 02:48:36,870
if we talk about programming yes we have
a pragma time

6538
02:48:36,870 --> 02:48:36,880
a pragma time
 

6539
02:48:36,880 --> 02:48:38,870
a pragma time
it means

6540
02:48:38,870 --> 02:48:38,880
it means
 

6541
02:48:38,880 --> 02:48:41,750
it means
message that user sign

will be executed only one time
so if we use this pragma if we don't use

6546
02:48:46,790 --> 02:48:46,800
so if we use this pragma if we don't use
 

6547
02:48:46,800 --> 02:48:48,230
so if we use this pragma if we don't use
the magma

6548
02:48:48,230 --> 02:48:48,240
the magma
 

6549
02:48:48,240 --> 02:48:55,429
the magma
we have a problem but

6550
02:48:55,429 --> 02:48:55,439

 

6551
02:48:55,439 --> 02:48:56,870

yeah yeah

6552
02:48:56,870 --> 02:48:56,880
yeah yeah
 

6553
02:48:56,880 --> 02:48:58,710
yeah yeah
i was asking because you know uh that

6554
02:48:58,710 --> 02:48:58,720
i was asking because you know uh that
 

6555
02:48:58,720 --> 02:49:00,469
i was asking because you know uh that
would actually take time for validators

6556
02:49:00,469 --> 02:49:00,479
would actually take time for validators
 

6557
02:49:00,479 --> 02:49:02,550
would actually take time for validators
and that would impact performance of the

6558
02:49:02,550 --> 02:49:02,560
and that would impact performance of the
 

6559
02:49:02,560 --> 02:49:04,469
and that would impact performance of the
network you know so that because it has

6560
02:49:04,469 --> 02:49:04,479
network you know so that because it has
 

6561
02:49:04,479 --> 02:49:07,429
network you know so that because it has
to be rechecked or uh who will actually

6562
02:49:07,429 --> 02:49:07,439
to be rechecked or uh who will actually
 

6563
02:49:07,439 --> 02:49:09,510
to be rechecked or uh who will actually
have to pay that fee because p is very

6564
02:49:09,510 --> 02:49:09,520
have to pay that fee because p is very
 

6565
02:49:09,520 --> 02:49:11,269
have to pay that fee because p is very
cheap but still you know

6566
02:49:11,269 --> 02:49:11,279
cheap but still you know
 

6567
02:49:11,279 --> 02:49:12,710
cheap but still you know
there is more

6568
02:49:12,710 --> 02:49:12,720
there is more
 

6569
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:15,990
there is more
more than one you would actually have to

6570
02:49:15,990 --> 02:49:16,000
more than one you would actually have to
 

6571
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,230
more than one you would actually have to
process it yeah

6572
02:49:18,230 --> 02:49:18,240
process it yeah
 

6573
02:49:18,240 --> 02:49:21,190

02:59:03,910 --> 02:59:03,920
from one network to another
 

6783
02:59:03,920 --> 02:59:05,269
from one network to another
mostly from

6784
02:59:05,269 --> 02:59:05,279
mostly from
 

6785
02:59:05,279 --> 02:59:08,309
mostly from
some evm to the error scale

6786
02:59:08,309 --> 02:59:08,319
some evm to the error scale
 

6787
02:59:08,319 --> 02:59:10,389
some evm to the error scale
but you can also use it for transferring

6788
02:59:10,389 --> 02:59:10,399
but you can also use it for transferring
 

6789
02:59:10,399 --> 02:59:14,630
but you can also use it for transferring
from one evm directly to another evm so

6790
02:59:14,630 --> 02:59:14,640
from one evm directly to another evm so
 

6791
02:59:14,640 --> 02:59:18,710
from one evm directly to another evm so
there is a rich functionality

which are called relays
 

6851
03:00:33,359 --> 03:00:35,510
which are called relays
so if you're familiar with the chain

6852
03:00:35,510 --> 03:00:35,520
so if you're familiar with the chain
 

6853
03:00:35,520 --> 03:00:37,750
so if you're familiar with the chain
link for example these are pretty much

6854
03:00:37,750 --> 03:00:37,760
link for example these are pretty much
 

6855
03:00:37,760 --> 03:00:42,469
link for example these are pretty much
the same uh these guys this relays

6856
03:00:42,469 --> 03:00:42,479
the same uh these guys this relays
 

6857
03:00:42,479 --> 03:00:45,510
the same uh these guys this relays
are in charge for confirming the fact of

6858
03:00:45,510 --> 03:00:45,520
are in charge for confirming the fact of
 

6859
03:00:45,520 --> 03:00:47,429
are in charge for confirming the fact of
the event

6860

the event
 

6861
03:00:47,439 --> 03:00:49,349
the event
so

6862
03:00:49,349 --> 03:00:49,359
so
 

6863
03:00:49,359 --> 03:00:51,990
so
they they are re-elected which is

6864
03:00:51,990 --> 03:00:52,000
they they are re-elected which is
 

6865
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,870
they they are re-elected which is
important for now every single week

6866
03:00:54,870 --> 03:00:54,880
important for now every single week
 

6867
03:00:54,880 --> 03:00:56,950
important for now every single week
which is also important uh it is

6868
03:00:56,950 --> 03:00:56,960
which is also important uh it is
 

6869
03:00:56,960 --> 03:00:59,750
which is also important uh it is
decentralized and anyone can become a

6870
03:00:59,750 --> 03:00:59,760
decentralized and anyone can become a
 

6871
03:00:59,760 --> 03:01:02,710
decentralized and anyone can become a
really all you need to do is to have a

6872
03:01:02,710 --> 03:01:02,720
really all you need to do is to have a
 

6873
03:01:02,720 --> 03:01:04,389
really all you need to do is to have a
stake in the

6874
03:01:04,389 --> 03:01:04,399
stake in the
 

6875
03:01:04,399 --> 03:01:07,830
stake in the
bridge tokens uh and uh

6876
03:01:07,830 --> 03:01:07,840
bridge tokens uh and uh
 

6877
03:01:07,840 --> 03:01:10,230
bridge tokens uh and uh
after that all you need is to run some

6878
03:01:10,230 --> 03:01:10,240
after that all you need is to run some
 

6879
03:01:10,240 --> 03:01:13,030
after that all you need is to run some
software which is called relay node

6880
03:01:13,030 --> 03:01:13,040
software which is called relay node
 

6881
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:15,590
software which is called relay node
uh it is open source uh you can find it

6882
03:01:15,590 --> 03:01:15,600
uh it is open source uh you can find it
 

6883
03:01:15,600 --> 03:01:17,750
uh it is open source uh you can find it
on the proxis github

6884
03:01:17,750 --> 03:01:17,760
on the proxis github
 

6885
03:01:17,760 --> 03:01:20,469
on the proxis github
uh so uh and so that's it here is the

6886
03:01:20,469 --> 03:01:20,479
uh so uh and so that's it here is the
 

6887
03:01:20,479 --> 03:01:23,030
uh so uh and so that's it here is the
magic right now we have the

6888
03:01:23,030 --> 03:01:23,040
magic right now we have the
 

6889
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:25,910
magic right now we have the
decentralized uh way to transfer

6890
03:01:25,910 --> 03:01:25,920
decentralized uh way to transfer
 

6891
03:01:25,920 --> 03:01:28,950
decentralized uh way to transfer
arbitrary messages from one network to

6892
03:01:28,950 --> 03:01:28,960
arbitrary messages from one network to
 

6893
03:01:28,960 --> 03:01:30,070
arbitrary messages from one network to
another

6894
03:01:30,070 --> 03:01:30,080
another
 

6895
03:01:30,080 --> 03:01:32,870
another
and uh what is personally my favorite

6896
03:01:32,870 --> 03:01:32,880
and uh what is personally my favorite
 

6897
03:01:32,880 --> 03:01:36,389
and uh what is personally my favorite
thing about october's bridge is that it

6898
03:01:36,389 --> 03:01:36,399
thing about october's bridge is that it
 

6899
03:01:36,399 --> 03:01:39,510
thing about october's bridge is that it
it is not about the token uh transfers

6900
03:01:39,510 --> 03:01:39,520
it is not about the token uh transfers
 

6901
03:01:39,520 --> 03:01:42,630
it is not about the token uh transfers
or something it is uh from the beginning

6902
03:01:42,630 --> 03:01:42,640
or something it is uh from the beginning
 

6903
03:01:42,640 --> 03:01:45,510
or something it is uh from the beginning
it was designed as an infrastructure

6904
03:01:45,510 --> 03:01:45,520
it was designed as an infrastructure
 

6905
03:01:45,520 --> 03:01:46,389
it was designed as an infrastructure
layer

6906
03:01:46,389 --> 03:01:46,399
layer
 

6907
03:01:46,399 --> 03:01:47,110
layer
so

6908
03:01:47,110 --> 03:01:47,120
so
 

6909
03:01:47,120 --> 03:01:51,110
so
uh literally anyone any developer can

6910
03:01:51,110 --> 03:01:51,120
uh literally anyone any developer can
 

6911
03:01:51,120 --> 03:01:54,550
uh literally anyone any developer can
connect to the octus bridge and use uh

6912
03:01:54,550 --> 03:01:54,560
connect to the octus bridge and use uh
 

6913
03:01:54,560 --> 03:01:56,309
connect to the octus bridge and use uh
its capabilities for its own

6914
03:01:56,309 --> 03:01:56,319

6917
03:01:58,560 --> 03:02:01,269
decentralized application
or which is even more important any

6918
03:02:01,269 --> 03:02:01,279
or which is even more important any
 

6919
03:02:01,279 --> 03:02:03,830
or which is even more important any

6920
03:02:03,830 --> 03:02:03,840
developer can uh
 

6921
03:02:03,840 --> 03:02:05,990
developer can uh
use the

6922
03:02:05,990 --> 03:02:06,000
use the
 

6923
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:06,870
use the
uh

6924
03:02:06,870 --> 03:02:06,880
uh
 

6925
03:02:06,880 --> 03:02:10,630
uh
some sdk uh which is already available

6926
03:02:10,630 --> 03:02:10,640
some sdk uh which is already available
 

6927
03:02:10,640 --> 03:02:12,630

to extend the current bridge

6928
03:02:12,630 --> 03:02:12,640
to extend the current bridge
 

6929
03:02:12,640 --> 03:02:14,150

just i'll tell you how to do it a little
 

6947
03:02:38,080 --> 03:02:41,190
just i'll tell you how to do it a little
bit later and that's it now you have

6948
03:02:41,190 --> 03:02:41,200
bit later and that's it now you have
 

6949
03:02:41,200 --> 03:02:44,790
bit later and that's it now you have
your own cross chain functionality

6950
03:02:44,790 --> 03:02:44,800
your own cross chain functionality
 

6951
03:02:44,800 --> 03:02:47,429
your own cross chain functionality
so this is actually as i said my goal is

6952
03:02:47,429 --> 03:02:47,439
so this is actually as i said my goal is
 

6953
03:02:47,439 --> 03:02:49,670
so this is actually as i said my goal is
to explain to you how to

6954
03:02:49,670 --> 03:02:49,680
to explain to you how to
 

6955
03:02:49,680 --> 03:02:51,190
to explain to you how to
extend current

6956
03:02:51,190 --> 03:02:51,200
extend current
 

6957
03:02:51,200 --> 03:02:53,030

current functions
 

6959
03:02:53,040 --> 03:02:54,790
current functions
and build your own cross chain

6960
03:02:54,790 --> 03:02:54,800
and build your own cross chain
 

6961
03:02:54,800 --> 03:02:56,550
and build your own cross chain
applications

6962
03:02:56,550 --> 03:02:56,560
applications
 

6963
03:02:56,560 --> 03:02:57,269
applications
so

6964
03:02:57,269 --> 03:02:57,279
so
 

6965
03:02:57,279 --> 03:03:00,710
so
okay let's move on also a few few more

6966
03:03:00,710 --> 03:03:00,720
okay let's move on also a few few more
 

6967
03:03:00,720 --> 03:03:02,870
okay let's move on also a few few more
uh words about the cross chain

6968
03:03:02,870 --> 03:03:02,880
uh words about the cross chain
 

6969
03:03:02,880 --> 03:03:05,830
uh words about the cross chain
applications why should you even care

6970
03:03:05,830 --> 03:03:05,840
applications why should you even care
 

6971
03:03:05,840 --> 03:03:07,110
applications why should you even care
about them

6972
03:03:07,110 --> 03:03:07,120
about them
 

6973
03:03:07,120 --> 03:03:10,309
about them
uh well uh like uh not so long time ago

6974
03:03:10,309 --> 03:03:10,319
uh well uh like uh not so long time ago
 

6975
03:03:10,319 --> 03:03:13,750
uh well uh like uh not so long time ago
we had one network ethereum of course

6976
03:03:13,750 --> 03:03:13,760
we had one network ethereum of course
 

6977
03:03:13,760 --> 03:03:17,429
we had one network ethereum of course
and all the users were using it all the

6978
03:03:17,429 --> 03:03:17,439
and all the users were using it all the

6982
03:03:23,030 --> 03:03:23,040
apps were launched
 

6983
03:03:23,040 --> 03:03:25,590
apps were launched
only on ethereum right now the situation

6984
03:03:25,590 --> 03:03:25,600
only on ethereum right now the situation
 

6985
03:03:25,600 --> 03:03:29,190
only on ethereum right now the situation
is different there are plenty uh

6986
03:03:29,190 --> 03:03:29,200
is different there are plenty uh
 

6987
03:03:29,200 --> 03:03:31,590
is different there are plenty uh
plenty um

6988
03:03:31,590 --> 03:03:31,600
plenty um

them
 

7001
03:03:47,920 --> 03:03:50,230
them
uh and for example right now when you

7002
03:03:50,230 --> 03:03:50,240
uh and for example right now when you
 

7003
03:03:50,240 --> 03:03:51,910
uh and for example right now when you
are launching a decentralized

7004
03:03:51,910 --> 03:03:51,920
are launching a decentralized
 

7005
03:03:51,920 --> 03:03:54,950

application you should answer yourself

7006
03:03:54,950 --> 03:03:54,960
application you should answer yourself
 

7007
03:03:54,960 --> 03:03:58,230
application you should answer yourself
question which network you should use

7008
03:03:58,230 --> 03:03:58,240
question which network you should use
 

7009
03:03:58,240 --> 03:04:00,309
question which network you should use
right let's say you want to launch your

7010
03:04:00,309 --> 03:04:00,319
right let's say you want to launch your
 

7011
03:04:00,319 --> 03:04:02,230
right let's say you want to launch your
application on ethereum but you should

7012
03:04:02,230 --> 03:04:02,240
application on ethereum but you should
 

7013
03:04:02,240 --> 03:04:04,230
application on ethereum but you should
keep in mind that it is for example

7014
03:04:04,230 --> 03:04:04,240
keep in mind that it is for example
 

7015
03:04:04,240 --> 03:04:06,830
keep in mind that it is for example
expensive sometimes

7016
03:04:06,830 --> 03:04:06,840
expensive sometimes
 

7017
03:04:06,840 --> 03:04:10,070
expensive sometimes
uh but uh for example has the largest

7018
03:04:10,070 --> 03:04:10,080
uh but uh for example has the largest
 

7019
03:04:10,080 --> 03:04:13,190
uh but uh for example has the largest
user base but you also have different

7020
03:04:13,190 --> 03:04:13,200
user base but you also have different
 

7021
03:04:13,200 --> 03:04:15,110
user base but you also have different
networks let's say binance smart chain

7022
03:04:15,110 --> 03:04:15,120
networks let's say binance smart chain
 

7023
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:18,469
networks let's say binance smart chain
which is not so expensive but way less

7024
03:04:18,469 --> 03:04:18,479
which is not so expensive but way less
 

7025
03:04:18,479 --> 03:04:20,070
which is not so expensive but way less
uh secure

7026
03:04:20,070 --> 03:04:20,080
uh secure
 

7027
03:04:20,080 --> 03:04:20,830
uh secure
so

7028
03:04:20,830 --> 03:04:20,840
so
 

7029
03:04:20,840 --> 03:04:24,790
so
um and uh by using the uh technologies

7030
03:04:24,790 --> 03:04:24,800
um and uh by using the uh technologies
 

7031
03:04:24,800 --> 03:04:27,269
um and uh by using the uh technologies
like an octopus bridge you can launch

7032
03:04:27,269 --> 03:04:27,279
like an octopus bridge you can launch
 

7033
03:04:27,279 --> 03:04:29,910
like an octopus bridge you can launch
the uh that's your decentralized

7034
03:04:29,910 --> 03:04:29,920
the uh that's your decentralized
 

7035
03:04:29,920 --> 03:04:31,110
the uh that's your decentralized
application

7036
03:04:31,110 --> 03:04:31,120
application
 

7037
03:04:31,120 --> 03:04:32,550
application
uh

7038
03:04:32,550 --> 03:04:32,560
uh
 

7039
03:04:32,560 --> 03:04:35,830
uh
in a way which allows you to for example

7040
03:04:35,830 --> 03:04:35,840
in a way which allows you to for example
 

7041
03:04:35,840 --> 03:04:39,030
in a way which allows you to for example
connect users from any other blockchain

7042
03:04:39,030 --> 03:04:39,040
connect users from any other blockchain
 

7043
03:04:39,040 --> 03:04:41,510
connect users from any other blockchain
actually it it's not even so important

7044
03:04:41,510 --> 03:04:41,520
actually it it's not even so important
 

7045
03:04:41,520 --> 03:04:44,230
actually it it's not even so important

development
 

7195
03:07:59,680 --> 03:08:01,590
development
uh then it will be

7196
03:08:01,590 --> 03:08:01,600
uh then it will be
 

7197
03:08:01,600 --> 03:08:03,750
uh then it will be
pretty especially with asynchronous

7198
03:08:03,750 --> 03:08:03,760
pretty especially with asynchronous

most of you
 

7211
03:08:19,680 --> 03:08:21,910
most of you
so basically all you need

7212
03:08:21,910 --> 03:08:21,920
so basically all you need
 

7213
03:08:21,920 --> 03:08:25,670
so basically all you need
is to specify the pair where the

7214
03:08:25,670 --> 03:08:25,680
is to specify the pair where the
 

7215
03:08:25,680 --> 03:08:28,230
is to specify the pair where the
first element is the target event and

7216
03:08:28,230 --> 03:08:28,240
first element is the target event and
 

7217
03:08:28,240 --> 03:08:31,349
first element is the target event and
the second one is the callback which

7218
03:08:31,349 --> 03:08:31,359
the second one is the callback which
 

7219
03:08:31,359 --> 03:08:33,190
the second one is the callback which
should be executed

7220
03:08:33,190 --> 03:08:33,200
should be executed
 

7221
03:08:33,200 --> 03:08:36,790
should be executed
uh in case the target event uh

7222
03:08:36,790 --> 03:08:36,800
uh in case the target event uh
 

7223
03:08:36,800 --> 03:08:38,870
uh in case the target event uh
exists i mean what was emitted for

7224
03:08:38,870 --> 03:08:38,880
exists i mean what was emitted for
 

7225
03:08:38,880 --> 03:08:39,910
exists i mean what was emitted for
example

7226
03:08:39,910 --> 03:08:39,920
example
 

7227
03:08:39,920 --> 03:08:42,630
example
uh so we can discuss on a high level the

7228
03:08:42,630 --> 03:08:42,640
uh so we can discuss on a high level the
 

7229
03:08:42,640 --> 03:08:44,710
uh so we can discuss on a high level the
cross chain token transfer

7230
03:08:44,710 --> 03:08:44,720
cross chain token transfer
 

7231
03:08:44,720 --> 03:08:48,070
cross chain token transfer
and basically uh this is just a two

7232
03:08:48,070 --> 03:08:48,080
and basically uh this is just a two
 

7233
03:08:48,080 --> 03:08:50,230
and basically uh this is just a two
event called back pairs

7234
03:08:50,230 --> 03:08:50,240
event called back pairs
 

7235
03:08:50,240 --> 03:08:53,030
event called back pairs
uh where for example in case the deposit

7236
03:08:53,030 --> 03:08:53,040
uh where for example in case the deposit
 

7237
03:08:53,040 --> 03:08:56,630
uh where for example in case the deposit
event occurred in the polygon

7238
03:08:56,630 --> 03:08:56,640
event occurred in the polygon
 

7239
03:08:56,640 --> 03:08:59,990
event occurred in the polygon
like the user have deposited 10 usdt

7240
03:08:59,990 --> 03:09:00,000
like the user have deposited 10 usdt
 

7241
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:03,349
like the user have deposited 10 usdt
well in this case the callback will be

7242
03:09:03,349 --> 03:09:03,359
well in this case the callback will be
 

7243
03:09:03,359 --> 03:09:08,070
well in this case the callback will be
mint 10 10 uh synthetic usdt in the in

7244
03:09:08,070 --> 03:09:08,080
mint 10 10 uh synthetic usdt in the in
 

7245
03:09:08,080 --> 03:09:10,870
mint 10 10 uh synthetic usdt in the in
the error scale right so that's it

7246
03:09:10,870 --> 03:09:10,880
the error scale right so that's it
 

7247
03:09:10,880 --> 03:09:13,830
the error scale right so that's it
uh and pretty much the same uh with the

7248
03:09:13,830 --> 03:09:13,840
uh and pretty much the same uh with the
 

7249
03:09:13,840 --> 03:09:17,269
uh and pretty much the same uh with the
opposite direction in case user

7250
03:09:17,269 --> 03:09:17,279
opposite direction in case user
 

7251
03:09:17,279 --> 03:09:18,790
opposite direction in case user
has burned

7252
03:09:18,790 --> 03:09:18,800
has burned
 

7253
03:09:18,800 --> 03:09:19,750
has burned
the

7254
03:09:19,750 --> 03:09:19,760
the
 

7255
03:09:19,760 --> 03:09:23,030
the
this 10 usdt well the callback in

7256
03:09:23,030 --> 03:09:23,040
this 10 usdt well the callback in
 

7257
03:09:23,040 --> 03:09:27,349
this 10 usdt well the callback in
polygon will be to release uh usdt from

7258
03:09:27,349 --> 03:09:27,359
polygon will be to release uh usdt from
 

7259
03:09:27,359 --> 03:09:29,110
polygon will be to release uh usdt from
the vault

7260
03:09:29,110 --> 03:09:29,120
the vault
 

7261
03:09:29,120 --> 03:09:31,349
the vault
that's it i think it's it's it's an

7262
03:09:31,349 --> 03:09:31,359
that's it i think it's it's it's an
 

7263
03:09:31,359 --> 03:09:34,229
that's it i think it's it's it's an
extremely simple model actually

7264
03:09:34,229 --> 03:09:34,239
extremely simple model actually
 

7265
03:09:34,239 --> 03:09:35,670
extremely simple model actually
uh so

7266
03:09:35,670 --> 03:09:35,680
uh so
 

7267
03:09:35,680 --> 03:09:39,190
uh so
a few words about the terms uh this uh

7268
03:09:39,190 --> 03:09:39,200
a few words about the terms uh this uh
 

7269
03:09:39,200 --> 03:09:42,150
a few words about the terms uh this uh
event called back pairs are specified as

7270
03:09:42,150 --> 03:09:42,160
event called back pairs are specified as
 

7271
03:09:42,160 --> 03:09:45,269
event called back pairs are specified as
a separate smart contract so there is no

7272
03:09:45,269 --> 03:09:45,279
a separate smart contract so there is no
 

7273
03:09:45,279 --> 03:09:47,910
a separate smart contract so there is no
like huge centralized configuration

7274
03:09:47,910 --> 03:09:47,920
like huge centralized configuration
 

7275
03:09:47,920 --> 03:09:49,830
like huge centralized configuration
somewhere on a github

7276
03:09:49,830 --> 03:09:49,840
somewhere on a github
 

7277
03:09:49,840 --> 03:09:52,790
somewhere on a github
all the configurations are just uh smart

7278
03:09:52,790 --> 03:09:52,800
all the configurations are just uh smart
 

7279
03:09:52,800 --> 03:09:55,349
all the configurations are just uh smart
contracts on the everscale network you

7280
03:09:55,349 --> 03:09:55,359
contracts on the everscale network you
 

7281
03:09:55,359 --> 03:09:56,790
contracts on the everscale network you
can deploy

7282
03:09:56,790 --> 03:09:56,800
can deploy
 

7283
03:09:56,800 --> 03:09:59,269
can deploy
them yourself like no problem

7284
03:09:59,269 --> 03:09:59,279
them yourself like no problem
 

7285
03:09:59,279 --> 03:10:01,830
them yourself like no problem
uh these configurations are also like a

7286
03:10:01,830 --> 03:10:01,840
uh these configurations are also like a
 

7287
03:10:01,840 --> 03:10:03,990
uh these configurations are also like a
pretty standard smart contract so

7288
03:10:03,990 --> 03:10:04,000
pretty standard smart contract so
 

7289
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:06,630
pretty standard smart contract so
they're already developed by us you can

7290
03:10:06,630 --> 03:10:06,640
they're already developed by us you can
 

7291
03:10:06,640 --> 03:10:09,510
they're already developed by us you can
just use them most likely you don't need

7292
03:10:09,510 --> 03:10:09,520
just use them most likely you don't need
 

7293
03:10:09,520 --> 03:10:12,389
just use them most likely you don't need
to develop your own custom configuration

7294
03:10:12,389 --> 03:10:12,399
to develop your own custom configuration
 

7295
03:10:12,399 --> 03:10:13,830
to develop your own custom configuration
contracts

7296
03:10:13,830 --> 03:10:13,840
contracts
 

7297
03:10:13,840 --> 03:10:14,950
contracts
so just

7298
03:10:14,950 --> 03:10:14,960
so just
 

7299
03:10:14,960 --> 03:10:17,110
so just
feel free to use

ours right out of the box
but one important thing that's to avoid

7304
03:10:22,950 --> 03:10:22,960
but one important thing that's to avoid
 

7305
03:10:22,960 --> 03:10:24,630
but one important thing that's to avoid
the potential

7306
03:10:24,630 --> 03:10:24,640
the potential
 

7307
03:10:24,640 --> 03:10:28,309
the potential
ddos attacks uh you can't create as many

7308
03:10:28,309 --> 03:10:28,319
ddos attacks uh you can't create as many
 

7309
03:10:28,319 --> 03:10:31,910
ddos attacks uh you can't create as many
configurations and expect relays to

7310
03:10:31,910 --> 03:10:31,920
configurations and expect relays to
 

7311
03:10:31,920 --> 03:10:35,830
configurations and expect relays to
maintain them uh for now uh dao bridge

7312
03:10:35,830 --> 03:10:35,840
maintain them uh for now uh dao bridge
 

7313
03:10:35,840 --> 03:10:36,870
maintain them uh for now uh dao bridge
dao

7314
03:10:36,870 --> 03:10:36,880
dao
 

7315
03:10:36,880 --> 03:10:39,269
dao
needs to approve every single

7316
03:10:39,269 --> 03:10:39,279
needs to approve every single
 

7317
03:10:39,279 --> 03:10:40,469
needs to approve every single
configuration

7318
03:10:40,469 --> 03:10:40,479
configuration
 

7319
03:10:40,479 --> 03:10:43,269
configuration
which basically says that okay release

7320
03:10:43,269 --> 03:10:43,279
which basically says that okay release
 

7321
03:10:43,279 --> 03:10:44,469
which basically says that okay release
now you're

7322
03:10:44,469 --> 03:10:44,479
now you're
 

7323
03:10:44,479 --> 03:10:48,309
now you're
uh responsible for maintaining this uh

7324
03:10:48,309 --> 03:10:48,319
uh responsible for maintaining this uh
 

7325
03:10:48,319 --> 03:10:49,990
uh responsible for maintaining this uh
event callback

7326
03:10:49,990 --> 03:10:50,000
event callback
 

7327
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:53,110
event callback
pairs maybe we will get rid of it later

7328
03:10:53,110 --> 03:10:53,120
pairs maybe we will get rid of it later
 

7329
03:10:53,120 --> 03:10:56,150
pairs maybe we will get rid of it later
or maybe not i'm not sure right now

7330
03:10:56,150 --> 03:10:56,160
or maybe not i'm not sure right now
 

7331
03:10:56,160 --> 03:10:58,309
or maybe not i'm not sure right now
it is it works this way

7332
03:10:58,309 --> 03:10:58,319
it is it works this way
 

7333
03:10:58,319 --> 03:11:00,229
it is it works this way
uh so

7334
03:11:00,229 --> 03:11:00,239
uh so
 

7335
03:11:00,239 --> 03:11:03,429
uh so
uh okay uh well this is this was the

7336
03:11:03,429 --> 03:11:03,439
uh okay uh well this is this was the
 

7337
03:11:03,439 --> 03:11:06,870
uh okay uh well this is this was the
basic theory right now we can move on

7338
03:11:06,870 --> 03:11:06,880
basic theory right now we can move on
 

7339
03:11:06,880 --> 03:11:11,190
basic theory right now we can move on
uh separately to the evm to ever scale

7340
03:11:11,190 --> 03:11:11,200
uh separately to the evm to ever scale
 

7341
03:11:11,200 --> 03:11:14,389
uh separately to the evm to ever scale
pipeline and after that i'll

7342
03:11:14,389 --> 03:11:14,399
pipeline and after that i'll
 

7343
03:11:14,399 --> 03:11:17,110
pipeline and after that i'll
tell you about the everscale to evm

7344
03:11:17,110 --> 03:11:17,120
tell you about the everscale to evm
 

7345
03:11:17,120 --> 03:11:18,950
tell you about the everscale to evm
pipeline which is pretty much the same

7346
03:11:18,950 --> 03:11:18,960
pipeline which is pretty much the same
 

7347
03:11:18,960 --> 03:11:22,950
pipeline which is pretty much the same
but has a few important differences

7348
03:11:22,950 --> 03:11:22,960
but has a few important differences
 

7349
03:11:22,960 --> 03:11:25,030
but has a few important differences
so uh

7350
03:11:25,030 --> 03:11:25,040
so uh
 

7351
03:11:25,040 --> 03:11:27,349
so uh
okay let's let's move on

7352
03:11:27,349 --> 03:11:27,359
okay let's let's move on
 

7353
03:11:27,359 --> 03:11:30,389
okay let's let's move on
uh so as i said uh

7354
03:11:30,389 --> 03:11:30,399
uh so as i said uh
 

7355
03:11:30,399 --> 03:11:33,590
uh so as i said uh
we are talking about the event callback

7356
03:11:33,590 --> 03:11:33,600
we are talking about the event callback
 

7357
03:11:33,600 --> 03:11:34,630
we are talking about the event callback
model

7358
03:11:34,630 --> 03:11:34,640
model
 

7359
03:11:34,640 --> 03:11:37,429
model
and every single target event uh let's

7360
03:11:37,429 --> 03:11:37,439
and every single target event uh let's
 

7361
03:11:37,439 --> 03:11:39,190
and every single target event uh let's
say from the polygon

7362
03:11:39,190 --> 03:11:39,200
say from the polygon
 

7363
03:11:39,200 --> 03:11:40,070
say from the polygon
uh

7364
03:11:40,070 --> 03:11:40,080
uh
 

7365
03:11:40,080 --> 03:11:42,389
uh
it should be represented

7366
03:11:42,389 --> 03:11:42,399
it should be represented
 

7367
03:11:42,399 --> 03:11:44,630
it should be represented
as a separate smart contract which is

7368
03:11:44,630 --> 03:11:44,640
as a separate smart contract which is
 

7369
03:11:44,640 --> 03:11:47,349
as a separate smart contract which is
called event contract in our terms

7370
03:11:47,349 --> 03:11:47,359
called event contract in our terms
 

7371
03:11:47,359 --> 03:11:49,990
called event contract in our terms
uh this is extremely lightweight

7372
03:11:49,990 --> 03:11:50,000
uh this is extremely lightweight
 

7373
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:53,190
uh this is extremely lightweight
simple and cheap smart construct

7374
03:11:53,190 --> 03:11:53,200
simple and cheap smart construct
 

7375
03:11:53,200 --> 03:11:56,469
simple and cheap smart construct
so

7376
03:11:56,469 --> 03:11:56,479

 

7377
03:11:56,479 --> 03:11:58,790

someone should deploy it usually user

7378
03:11:58,790 --> 03:11:58,800
someone should deploy it usually user
 

7379
03:11:58,800 --> 03:12:02,870
someone should deploy it usually user
deploys it for himself and basically

7380
03:12:02,870 --> 03:12:02,880
deploys it for himself and basically
 

7381
03:12:02,880 --> 03:12:04,550
deploys it for himself and basically
what does it mean

7382
03:12:04,550 --> 03:12:04,560
what does it mean
 

7383
03:12:04,560 --> 03:12:07,670
what does it mean
uh that event contract stores all the

7384
03:12:07,670 --> 03:12:07,680
uh that event contract stores all the
 

7385
03:12:07,680 --> 03:12:10,870
uh that event contract stores all the
data about the target event like the

7386
03:12:10,870 --> 03:12:10,880
data about the target event like the
 

7387
03:12:10,880 --> 03:12:13,030
data about the target event like the
content of the event i don't know

7388
03:12:13,030 --> 03:12:13,040
content of the event i don't know
 

7389
03:12:13,040 --> 03:12:16,150
content of the event i don't know
transaction hash block hash and

7390
03:12:16,150 --> 03:12:16,160
transaction hash block hash and
 

7391
03:12:16,160 --> 03:12:17,429
transaction hash block hash and
stuff like that

7392
03:12:17,429 --> 03:12:17,439
stuff like that
 

7393
03:12:17,439 --> 03:12:19,110
stuff like that
uh so after

7394
03:12:19,110 --> 03:12:19,120
uh so after
 

7395
03:12:19,120 --> 03:12:21,349
uh so after
after the event contract is deployed

7396
03:12:21,349 --> 03:12:21,359
after the event contract is deployed
 

7397
03:12:21,359 --> 03:12:22,389
after the event contract is deployed
relays

7398
03:12:22,389 --> 03:12:22,399
relays
 

7399
03:12:22,399 --> 03:12:23,269
relays
uh

7400
03:12:23,269 --> 03:12:23,279
uh
 

7401
03:12:23,279 --> 03:12:25,830
uh
basically need to

7402
03:12:25,830 --> 03:12:25,840
basically need to
 

7403
03:12:25,840 --> 03:12:29,269
basically need to
uh compare the exact event in the

7404
03:12:29,269 --> 03:12:29,279
uh compare the exact event in the
 

7405
03:12:29,279 --> 03:12:32,870
uh compare the exact event in the
polygon and the events representation uh

7406
03:12:32,870 --> 03:12:32,880
polygon and the events representation uh
 

7407
03:12:32,880 --> 03:12:35,269
polygon and the events representation uh
in the form of event contracts and in

7408
03:12:35,269 --> 03:12:35,279
in the form of event contracts and in
 

7409
03:12:35,279 --> 03:12:37,670
in the form of event contracts and in
case everything is is fine everything is

7410
03:12:37,670 --> 03:12:37,680
case everything is is fine everything is
 

7411
03:12:37,680 --> 03:12:40,630
case everything is is fine everything is
the same all the details block hashes

7412
03:12:40,630 --> 03:12:40,640
the same all the details block hashes
 

7413
03:12:40,640 --> 03:12:41,750
the same all the details block hashes
and so on

7414
03:12:41,750 --> 03:12:41,760
and so on
 

7415
03:12:41,760 --> 03:12:45,429
and so on
uh is the same then relay just

7416
03:12:45,429 --> 03:12:45,439
uh is the same then relay just
 

7417
03:12:45,439 --> 03:12:47,990
uh is the same then relay just
sends every single relay sends

7418
03:12:47,990 --> 03:12:48,000
sends every single relay sends
 

7419
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:51,510
sends every single relay sends
the special confirmation message

7420
03:12:51,510 --> 03:12:51,520
the special confirmation message
 

7421
03:12:51,520 --> 03:12:53,349
the special confirmation message
so

7422
03:12:53,349 --> 03:12:53,359
so
 

7423
03:12:53,359 --> 03:12:55,590
so
interesting thing that in every scale it

7424
03:12:55,590 --> 03:12:55,600
interesting thing that in every scale it
 

7425
03:12:55,600 --> 03:12:57,590
interesting thing that in every scale it
is possible to implement

7426
03:12:57,590 --> 03:12:57,600
is possible to implement
 

7427
03:12:57,600 --> 03:13:00,790
is possible to implement
the contract base itself

7428
03:13:00,790 --> 03:13:00,800
the contract base itself
 

7429
03:13:00,800 --> 03:13:02,070
the contract base itself
model

7430
03:13:02,070 --> 03:13:02,080
model
 

7431
03:13:02,080 --> 03:13:04,950
model
that's why relays don't even have their

7432
03:13:04,950 --> 03:13:04,960
that's why relays don't even have their
 

7433
03:13:04,960 --> 03:13:06,870
that's why relays don't even have their
wallets they don't even have their

7434
03:13:06,870 --> 03:13:06,880
wallets they don't even have their
 

7435
03:13:06,880 --> 03:13:09,750
wallets they don't even have their
errors to spend on a guest

7436
03:13:09,750 --> 03:13:09,760
errors to spend on a guest
 

7437
03:13:09,760 --> 03:13:12,710
errors to spend on a guest
event contracts pays themselves for

7438
03:13:12,710 --> 03:13:12,720
event contracts pays themselves for
 

7439
03:13:12,720 --> 03:13:14,870
event contracts pays themselves for
confirmations or rejects

7440
03:13:14,870 --> 03:13:14,880
confirmations or rejects
 

7441
03:13:14,880 --> 03:13:17,590
confirmations or rejects
uh and uh

7442
03:13:17,590 --> 03:13:17,600
uh and uh
 

7443
03:13:17,600 --> 03:13:18,389
uh and uh
yeah

7444
03:13:18,389 --> 03:13:18,399
yeah
 

7445
03:13:18,399 --> 03:13:20,790
yeah
this is also like an amazing thing about

7446
03:13:20,790 --> 03:13:20,800
this is also like an amazing thing about
 

7447
03:13:20,800 --> 03:13:24,469
this is also like an amazing thing about
the error scale and uh once uh the some

7448
03:13:24,469 --> 03:13:24,479
the error scale and uh once uh the some
 

7449
03:13:24,479 --> 03:13:27,269
the error scale and uh once uh the some
threshold is reached then the callback

7450
03:13:27,269 --> 03:13:27,279
threshold is reached then the callback
 

7451
03:13:27,279 --> 03:13:30,309
threshold is reached then the callback
is executed so that that's it it is

7452
03:13:30,309 --> 03:13:30,319
is executed so that that's it it is
 

7453
03:13:30,319 --> 03:13:32,150
is executed so that that's it it is
it's that simple

7454
03:13:32,150 --> 03:13:32,160
it's that simple
 

7455
03:13:32,160 --> 03:13:35,429
it's that simple
uh so um as i said uh we have the

7456
03:13:35,429 --> 03:13:35,439
uh so um as i said uh we have the
 

7457
03:13:35,439 --> 03:13:37,269
uh so um as i said uh we have the
configuration contracts and they're used

7458
03:13:37,269 --> 03:13:37,279
configuration contracts and they're used
 

7459
03:13:37,279 --> 03:13:39,510
configuration contracts and they're used
as a factory for event

7460
03:13:39,510 --> 03:13:39,520
as a factory for event
 

7461
03:13:39,520 --> 03:13:41,349
as a factory for event
contracts that's it

7462
03:13:41,349 --> 03:13:41,359
contracts that's it
 

7463
03:13:41,359 --> 03:13:44,710
contracts that's it
uh so uh

7464
03:13:44,710 --> 03:13:44,720

 

7465
03:13:44,720 --> 03:13:47,429

let's say uh in case of the regular

7466
03:13:47,429 --> 03:13:47,439
let's say uh in case of the regular
 

7467
03:13:47,439 --> 03:13:49,830
let's say uh in case of the regular
token transfer cross chain

7468
03:13:49,830 --> 03:13:49,840
token transfer cross chain
 

7469
03:13:49,840 --> 03:13:51,349
token transfer cross chain
uh the

7470
03:13:51,349 --> 03:13:51,359
uh the
 

7471
03:13:51,359 --> 03:13:55,110
uh the
callback contra contract implements the

7472
03:13:55,110 --> 03:13:55,120
callback contra contract implements the
 

7473
03:13:55,120 --> 03:13:57,990
callback contra contract implements the
mint functionality and

7474
03:13:57,990 --> 03:13:58,000
mint functionality and
 

7475
03:13:58,000 --> 03:13:59,429
mint functionality and
it

7476
03:13:59,429 --> 03:13:59,439
it
 

7477
03:13:59,439 --> 03:14:02,469
it
sees the details from the event contract

7478
03:14:02,469 --> 03:14:02,479
sees the details from the event contract
 

7479
03:14:02,479 --> 03:14:04,150
sees the details from the event contract
it sees that okay

7480
03:14:04,150 --> 03:14:04,160
it sees that okay
 

7481
03:14:04,160 --> 03:14:08,469
it sees that okay
the 10 usdt was locked on the polygon

7482
03:14:08,469 --> 03:14:08,479
the 10 usdt was locked on the polygon
 

7483
03:14:08,479 --> 03:14:11,510
the 10 usdt was locked on the polygon
so it means that i should mean 10 usdt

7484
03:14:11,510 --> 03:14:11,520
so it means that i should mean 10 usdt
 

7485
03:14:11,520 --> 03:14:15,510
so it means that i should mean 10 usdt
to this user like that's it uh i hope i

7486
03:14:15,510 --> 03:14:15,520
to this user like that's it uh i hope i
 

7487
03:14:15,520 --> 03:14:17,750
to this user like that's it uh i hope i
hope it's it's clear how to implement

7488
03:14:17,750 --> 03:14:17,760
hope it's it's clear how to implement
 

7489
03:14:17,760 --> 03:14:20,229
hope it's it's clear how to implement
the evm to ever scale

7490
03:14:20,229 --> 03:14:20,239
the evm to ever scale
 

7491
03:14:20,239 --> 03:14:20,950
the evm to ever scale
uh

7492
03:14:20,950 --> 03:14:20,960
uh
 

7493
03:14:20,960 --> 03:14:23,750
uh
pipelines also i'll tell you about the

7494
03:14:23,750 --> 03:14:23,760
pipelines also i'll tell you about the
 

7495
03:14:23,760 --> 03:14:26,150
pipelines also i'll tell you about the
everscale to evm pipelines which means

7496
03:14:26,150 --> 03:14:26,160
everscale to evm pipelines which means
 

7497
03:14:26,160 --> 03:14:28,070
everscale to evm pipelines which means
that it should be clear for you how to

7498
03:14:28,070 --> 03:14:28,080
that it should be clear for you how to
 

7499
03:14:28,080 --> 03:14:31,429
that it should be clear for you how to
implement evm to evm pipelines this is

7500
03:14:31,429 --> 03:14:31,439
implement evm to evm pipelines this is
 

7501
03:14:31,439 --> 03:14:34,070
implement evm to evm pipelines this is
also an amazing thing you can

7502
03:14:34,070 --> 03:14:34,080
also an amazing thing you can
 

7503
03:14:34,080 --> 03:14:37,269
also an amazing thing you can
create the crosschain applications and

7504
03:14:37,269 --> 03:14:37,279
create the crosschain applications and
 

7505
03:14:37,279 --> 03:14:40,150
create the crosschain applications and
your user don't need even to know about

7506
03:14:40,150 --> 03:14:40,160
your user don't need even to know about
 

7507
03:14:40,160 --> 03:14:43,269
your user don't need even to know about
the ever scale

7508
03:14:43,269 --> 03:14:43,279

 

7509
03:14:43,279 --> 03:14:45,670

you don't even need to have a wallet or

7510
03:14:45,670 --> 03:14:45,680
you don't even need to have a wallet or
 

7511
03:14:45,680 --> 03:14:46,790
you don't even need to have a wallet or
something

7512
03:14:46,790 --> 03:14:46,800
something
 

7513
03:14:46,800 --> 03:14:49,349
something
you're just using these two pipelines

7514
03:14:49,349 --> 03:14:49,359
you're just using these two pipelines
 

7515
03:14:49,359 --> 03:14:52,229
you're just using these two pipelines
and uh now you're connecting to evm

7516
03:14:52,229 --> 03:14:52,239
and uh now you're connecting to evm
 

7517
03:14:52,239 --> 03:14:54,790
and uh now you're connecting to evm
networks amazing feature

7518
03:14:54,790 --> 03:14:54,800
networks amazing feature
 

7519
03:14:54,800 --> 03:14:56,870
networks amazing feature
uh so yeah a few words about the

7520
03:14:56,870 --> 03:14:56,880
uh so yeah a few words about the
 

7521
03:14:56,880 --> 03:14:59,349
uh so yeah a few words about the
everscale to evm

7522
03:14:59,349 --> 03:14:59,359
everscale to evm
 

7523
03:14:59,359 --> 03:15:02,070
everscale to evm
pipeline the only difference everything

7524
03:15:02,070 --> 03:15:02,080
pipeline the only difference everything
 

7525
03:15:02,080 --> 03:15:03,750
pipeline the only difference everything
is pretty much the same the only

7526
03:15:03,750 --> 03:15:03,760
is pretty much the same the only
 

7527
03:15:03,760 --> 03:15:07,590
is pretty much the same the only
difference is that relays don't send any

7528
03:15:07,590 --> 03:15:07,600
difference is that relays don't send any
 

7529
03:15:07,600 --> 03:15:11,670
difference is that relays don't send any
messages to the evm as they are doing by

7530
03:15:11,670 --> 03:15:11,680
messages to the evm as they are doing by
 

7531
03:15:11,680 --> 03:15:14,950
messages to the evm as they are doing by
sending messages to the everscale

7532
03:15:14,950 --> 03:15:14,960
sending messages to the everscale
 

7533
03:15:14,960 --> 03:15:16,630
sending messages to the everscale
this is as you

7534
03:15:16,630 --> 03:15:16,640
this is as you
 

7535
03:15:16,640 --> 03:15:18,150
this is as you
as you know

7536
03:15:18,150 --> 03:15:18,160
as you know
 

7537
03:15:18,160 --> 03:15:20,229
as you know
it may be pretty expensive because of

7538
03:15:20,229 --> 03:15:20,239
it may be pretty expensive because of
 

7539
03:15:20,239 --> 03:15:23,349
it may be pretty expensive because of
the network fees let's say in ethereum

7540
03:15:23,349 --> 03:15:23,359
the network fees let's say in ethereum
 

7541
03:15:23,359 --> 03:15:26,870
the network fees let's say in ethereum
uh so what the relays are doing instead

7542
03:15:26,870 --> 03:15:26,880
uh so what the relays are doing instead
 

7543
03:15:26,880 --> 03:15:27,910
uh so what the relays are doing instead
they're

7544
03:15:27,910 --> 03:15:27,920
they're
 

7545
03:15:27,920 --> 03:15:31,590
they're
storing uh some signature which is made

7546
03:15:31,590 --> 03:15:31,600
storing uh some signature which is made
 

7547
03:15:31,600 --> 03:15:34,550
storing uh some signature which is made
with their private key uh to their

7548
03:15:34,550 --> 03:15:34,560
with their private key uh to their
 

7549
03:15:34,560 --> 03:15:36,550
with their private key uh to their
they're putting the signature to the

7550
03:15:36,550 --> 03:15:36,560
they're putting the signature to the
 

7551
03:15:36,560 --> 03:15:40,309
they're putting the signature to the
event contract on the everscale side and

7552
03:15:40,309 --> 03:15:40,319
event contract on the everscale side and
 

7553
03:15:40,319 --> 03:15:41,910
event contract on the everscale side and
uh

7554
03:15:41,910 --> 03:15:41,920
uh
 

7555
03:15:41,920 --> 03:15:45,429
uh
the public key of the relays unknown on

7556
03:15:45,429 --> 03:15:45,439
the public key of the relays unknown on
 

7557
03:15:45,439 --> 03:15:47,910
the public key of the relays unknown on
the polygon for example there is a

7558
03:15:47,910 --> 03:15:47,920
the polygon for example there is a
 

7559
03:15:47,920 --> 03:15:50,229
the polygon for example there is a
special smart contract which stores this

7560
03:15:50,229 --> 03:15:50,239
special smart contract which stores this
 

7561
03:15:50,239 --> 03:15:53,030
special smart contract which stores this
uh public key and you can ask it let's

7562
03:15:53,030 --> 03:15:53,040
uh public key and you can ask it let's
 

7563
03:15:53,040 --> 03:15:57,429
uh public key and you can ask it let's
say uh who signed this payload was it a

7564
03:15:57,429 --> 03:15:57,439
say uh who signed this payload was it a
 

7565
03:15:57,439 --> 03:15:59,110
say uh who signed this payload was it a
relay or not

7566
03:15:59,110 --> 03:15:59,120
relay or not
 

7567
03:15:59,120 --> 03:16:01,590
relay or not
so oh and that's it since you have the

7568
03:16:01,590 --> 03:16:01,600
so oh and that's it since you have the
 

7569
03:16:01,600 --> 03:16:03,830
so oh and that's it since you have the
signatures and you have the payload you

7570
03:16:03,830 --> 03:16:03,840
signatures and you have the payload you
 

7571
03:16:03,840 --> 03:16:07,190
signatures and you have the payload you
can uh send them to some let's say evm

7572
03:16:07,190 --> 03:16:07,200
can uh send them to some let's say evm
 

7573
03:16:07,200 --> 03:16:08,870
can uh send them to some let's say evm
polygon vault

7574
03:16:08,870 --> 03:16:08,880
polygon vault
 

7575
03:16:08,880 --> 03:16:10,710
polygon vault
and the vault will check that these

7576
03:16:10,710 --> 03:16:10,720
and the vault will check that these
 

7577
03:16:10,720 --> 03:16:13,510
and the vault will check that these
signatures were made by the

7578
03:16:13,510 --> 03:16:13,520
signatures were made by the
 

7579
03:16:13,520 --> 03:16:16,150
signatures were made by the
actual relays and if everything is

7580
03:16:16,150 --> 03:16:16,160
actual relays and if everything is
 

7581
03:16:16,160 --> 03:16:18,070
actual relays and if everything is
correct if

7582
03:16:18,070 --> 03:16:18,080
correct if
 

7583
03:16:18,080 --> 03:16:21,670
correct if
the threshold is reached and so on well

7584
03:16:21,670 --> 03:16:21,680
the threshold is reached and so on well
 

7585
03:16:21,680 --> 03:16:25,269
the threshold is reached and so on well
then the vault will release the

7586
03:16:25,269 --> 03:16:25,279
then the vault will release the
 

7587
03:16:25,279 --> 03:16:28,950
then the vault will release the
usdt uh to the user so uh that's it as

7588
03:16:28,950 --> 03:16:28,960
usdt uh to the user so uh that's it as
 

7589
03:16:28,960 --> 03:16:31,910
usdt uh to the user so uh that's it as
you see it is reliable and uh pretty

7590
03:16:31,910 --> 03:16:31,920
you see it is reliable and uh pretty
 

7591
03:16:31,920 --> 03:16:34,630
you see it is reliable and uh pretty
cheap uh i mean from the economy point

7592
03:16:34,630 --> 03:16:34,640
cheap uh i mean from the economy point
 

7593
03:16:34,640 --> 03:16:37,910
cheap uh i mean from the economy point
of view there is no struggle for relays

7594
03:16:37,910 --> 03:16:37,920
of view there is no struggle for relays
 

7595
03:16:37,920 --> 03:16:41,349
of view there is no struggle for relays
from uh sending uh regular transactions

7596
03:16:41,349 --> 03:16:41,359
from uh sending uh regular transactions
 

7597
03:16:41,359 --> 03:16:44,389
from uh sending uh regular transactions
to the evm uh networks

7598
03:16:44,389 --> 03:16:44,399
to the evm uh networks
 

7599
03:16:44,399 --> 03:16:47,349
to the evm uh networks
uh okay so i think we can

7600
03:16:47,349 --> 03:16:47,359
uh okay so i think we can
 

7601
03:16:47,359 --> 03:16:49,990
uh okay so i think we can
move on from here so yeah let me just uh

7602
03:16:49,990 --> 03:16:50,000
move on from here so yeah let me just uh
 

7603
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:53,030
move on from here so yeah let me just uh
clarify once again the

7604
03:16:53,030 --> 03:16:53,040
clarify once again the
 

7605
03:16:53,040 --> 03:16:56,710
clarify once again the
most common uh octus bridge pipeline

7606
03:16:56,710 --> 03:16:56,720
most common uh octus bridge pipeline
 

7607
03:16:56,720 --> 03:16:59,510
most common uh octus bridge pipeline
the cross chain token transfer

7608
03:16:59,510 --> 03:16:59,520
the cross chain token transfer
 

7609
03:16:59,520 --> 03:17:03,190
the cross chain token transfer
so as you see uh it can consists

7610
03:17:03,190 --> 03:17:03,200
so as you see uh it can consists
 

7611
03:17:03,200 --> 03:17:05,750
so as you see uh it can consists
basically from two pipelines

7612
03:17:05,750 --> 03:17:05,760
basically from two pipelines
 

7613
03:17:05,760 --> 03:17:07,190
basically from two pipelines
one is uh

7614
03:17:07,190 --> 03:17:07,200
one is uh
 

7615
03:17:07,200 --> 03:17:10,950
one is uh
ethereum to every scale where user locks

7616
03:17:10,950 --> 03:17:10,960

and uh
 

7623
03:17:18,640 --> 03:17:22,150
and uh
this target event leads to uh minting

7624
03:17:22,150 --> 03:17:22,160
this target event leads to uh minting
 

7625

03:17:31,920 --> 03:17:34,389
usdt leads to releasing them on the
ethereum world so you know

7632
03:17:34,389 --> 03:17:34,399
ethereum world so you know
 

7633
03:17:34,399 --> 03:17:36,229
ethereum world so you know
that's it i don't know i don't even know

what to say because it is extremely

7636
03:17:38,150 --> 03:17:38,160
what to say because it is extremely
 

7637
03:17:38,160 --> 03:17:40,790
what to say because it is extremely
simple pipeline and you can create your

7638
03:17:40,790 --> 03:17:40,800
simple pipeline and you can create your
 

7639
03:17:40,800 --> 03:17:43,110
simple pipeline and you can create your
own customize this one

own customize this one
 

7641
03:17:43,120 --> 03:17:44,550
own customize this one
and it will work

7642
03:17:44,550 --> 03:17:44,560
and it will work
 

7643
03:17:44,560 --> 03:17:46,150
and it will work
just the same

7644
03:17:46,150 --> 03:17:46,160
just the same
 

7645
03:17:46,160 --> 03:17:48,389
just the same
so all the contracts also are open

7646
03:17:48,389 --> 03:17:48,399
so all the contracts also are open
 

7647
03:17:48,399 --> 03:17:51,349
so all the contracts also are open

so uh the evm volts contract is

7652
03:17:55,750 --> 03:17:55,760
so uh the evm volts contract is
 

7653
03:17:55,760 --> 03:17:59,110
so uh the evm volts contract is
basically the fork of y iron with two

7654
03:17:59,110 --> 03:17:59,120
basically the fork of y iron with two
 

7655
03:17:59,120 --> 03:18:01,830
basically the fork of y iron with two
walls uh which is uh

7656
03:18:01,830 --> 03:18:01,840
walls uh which is uh
 

7657
03:18:01,840 --> 03:18:03,910
walls uh which is uh
which allows us to

see the

7666
03:18:12,150 --> 03:18:12,160
see the
 

7667
03:18:12,160 --> 03:18:14,630
see the

usdt tokens on the error scale side
 

7673
03:18:20,960 --> 03:18:24,469
usdt tokens on the error scale side
so that's it you can uh imagine the same

03:18:48,160 --> 03:18:51,349
you know without even changing knowing
uh about all this uh bridge and

7694
03:18:51,349 --> 03:18:51,359
uh about all this uh bridge and
 

7695
03:18:51,359 --> 03:18:53,269
uh about all this uh bridge and

things like as i said uh configurations
 

7707
03:19:05,200 --> 03:19:07,110
things like as i said uh configurations
are already implemented just use them

7708
03:19:07,110 --> 03:19:07,120
are already implemented just use them
 

7709
03:19:07,120 --> 03:19:09,030
are already implemented just use them
rather out of the box

7710
03:19:09,030 --> 03:19:09,040
rather out of the box
 

7711
03:19:09,040 --> 03:19:13,429
rather out of the box
uh event contracts are usually uh looks

7712
03:19:13,429 --> 03:19:13,439
uh event contracts are usually uh looks
 

7713
03:19:13,439 --> 03:19:14,630
uh event contracts are usually uh looks
the same

7714
03:19:14,630 --> 03:19:14,640
the same
 

7715
03:19:14,640 --> 03:19:17,990
the same
they're all like standard only in case

7716
03:19:17,990 --> 03:19:18,000
they're all like standard only in case
 

7717
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:20,070
they're all like standard only in case
there are a few cases when you need a

7718
03:19:20,070 --> 03:19:20,080
there are a few cases when you need a
 

7719
03:19:20,080 --> 03:19:22,469
there are a few cases when you need a
custom event contracts basically when

7720
03:19:22,469 --> 03:19:22,479
custom event contracts basically when
 

7721
03:19:22,479 --> 03:19:26,070
custom event contracts basically when
you need a data mutation inside them but

7722
03:19:26,070 --> 03:19:26,080
you need a data mutation inside them but
 

7723
03:19:26,080 --> 03:19:28,950
you need a data mutation inside them but
this is like complex and rare scenario

7724
03:19:28,950 --> 03:19:28,960
this is like complex and rare scenario
 

7725
03:19:28,960 --> 03:19:29,910
this is like complex and rare scenario
so

7726
03:19:29,910 --> 03:19:29,920
so
 

7727
03:19:29,920 --> 03:19:31,670
so
most likely you don't need to implement

7728
03:19:31,670 --> 03:19:31,680
most likely you don't need to implement
 

7729
03:19:31,680 --> 03:19:34,389
most likely you don't need to implement
this event contract yourself

7730
03:19:34,389 --> 03:19:34,399
this event contract yourself
 

7731
03:19:34,399 --> 03:19:36,630
this event contract yourself
and it means that basically all you need

7732
03:19:36,630 --> 03:19:36,640
and it means that basically all you need
 

7733
03:19:36,640 --> 03:19:39,429
and it means that basically all you need
to implement is just one contract which

7734
03:19:39,429 --> 03:19:39,439
to implement is just one contract which
 

7735
03:19:39,439 --> 03:19:42,950
to implement is just one contract which
is responsible for the callback logic

7736
03:19:42,950 --> 03:19:42,960
is responsible for the callback logic
 

7737
03:19:42,960 --> 03:19:45,750
is responsible for the callback logic
on every scale and one contract which is

7738
03:19:45,750 --> 03:19:45,760
on every scale and one contract which is
 

7739
03:19:45,760 --> 03:19:48,950
on every scale and one contract which is
responsible for callback logic on the

7740
03:19:48,950 --> 03:19:48,960
responsible for callback logic on the
 

7741
03:19:48,960 --> 03:19:50,630
responsible for callback logic on the
evm side

7742
03:19:50,630 --> 03:19:50,640
evm side
 

7743
03:19:50,640 --> 03:19:53,590
evm side
so uh yeah that that's it all these

7744
03:19:53,590 --> 03:19:53,600
so uh yeah that that's it all these
 

7745
03:19:53,600 --> 03:19:57,110
so uh yeah that that's it all these
contracts have uh the standard interface

7746
03:19:57,110 --> 03:19:57,120
contracts have uh the standard interface
 

7747
03:19:57,120 --> 03:19:59,750
contracts have uh the standard interface
you can uh see for

7748
03:19:59,750 --> 03:19:59,760
you can uh see for
 

7749
03:19:59,760 --> 03:20:03,030
you can uh see for
for details in our repos i think it is

7750
03:20:03,030 --> 03:20:03,040
for details in our repos i think it is
 

7751
03:20:03,040 --> 03:20:03,750
for details in our repos i think it is
like

7752
03:20:03,750 --> 03:20:03,760
like
 

7753
03:20:03,760 --> 03:20:04,710
like
uh

7754
03:20:04,710 --> 03:20:04,720
uh
 

7755
03:20:04,720 --> 03:20:07,349
uh
not a complex task to implement this

7756
03:20:07,349 --> 03:20:07,359
not a complex task to implement this
 

7757
03:20:07,359 --> 03:20:08,469
not a complex task to implement this
contract

7758
03:20:08,469 --> 03:20:08,479
contract
 

7759
03:20:08,479 --> 03:20:10,950
contract
um yes so uh

7760
03:20:10,950 --> 03:20:10,960
um yes so uh
 

7761
03:20:10,960 --> 03:20:13,990
um yes so uh
that's it this is a pretty small

7762
03:20:13,990 --> 03:20:14,000
that's it this is a pretty small
 

7763
03:20:14,000 --> 03:20:15,830
that's it this is a pretty small
workshop

7764
03:20:15,830 --> 03:20:15,840
workshop
 

7765
03:20:15,840 --> 03:20:16,950
workshop
i hope

7766
03:20:16,950 --> 03:20:16,960
i hope
 

7767
03:20:16,960 --> 03:20:19,110
i hope
i was clear and if you have any

7768
03:20:19,110 --> 03:20:19,120
i was clear and if you have any
 

7769
03:20:19,120 --> 03:20:22,630
i was clear and if you have any
questions please feel free to ask

7770
03:20:22,630 --> 03:20:22,640
questions please feel free to ask
 

7771
03:20:22,640 --> 03:20:25,349
questions please feel free to ask
thank you sergey

7772
03:20:25,349 --> 03:20:25,359
thank you sergey
 

7773
03:20:25,359 --> 03:20:29,990
thank you sergey
do you have any questions guys

7774
03:20:29,990 --> 03:20:30,000

 

7775
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:31,590

okay we have one online question

7776
03:20:31,590 --> 03:20:31,600
okay we have one online question
 

7777
03:20:31,600 --> 03:20:34,630
okay we have one online question
probably

7778
03:20:34,630 --> 03:20:34,640

 

7779
03:20:34,640 --> 03:20:37,670

um so team rubicon asks uh sergey if you

7780
03:20:37,670 --> 03:20:37,680
um so team rubicon asks uh sergey if you
 

7781
03:20:37,680 --> 03:20:39,030
um so team rubicon asks uh sergey if you
had to single out

7782
03:20:39,030 --> 03:20:39,040
had to single out
 

7783
03:20:39,040 --> 03:20:41,269
had to single out
uh the key advantage of octus bridge

7784
03:20:41,269 --> 03:20:41,279
uh the key advantage of octus bridge
 

7785
03:20:41,279 --> 03:20:43,110
uh the key advantage of octus bridge
over other bridges what would you single

7786
03:20:43,110 --> 03:20:43,120
over other bridges what would you single
 

7787
03:20:43,120 --> 03:20:45,110
over other bridges what would you single
out first

7788
03:20:45,110 --> 03:20:45,120
out first
 

7789
03:20:45,120 --> 03:20:47,670
out first
uh i would say that

7790
03:20:47,670 --> 03:20:47,680
uh i would say that
 

7791
03:20:47,680 --> 03:20:50,790
uh i would say that
the key advantages as the design which

7792
03:20:50,790 --> 03:20:50,800
the key advantages as the design which
 

7793
03:20:50,800 --> 03:20:53,830
the key advantages as the design which
is not about the specific

7794
03:20:53,830 --> 03:20:53,840
is not about the specific
 

7795
03:20:53,840 --> 03:20:56,070
is not about the specific
action like token transfer or anything

7796
03:20:56,070 --> 03:20:56,080
action like token transfer or anything
 

7797
03:20:56,080 --> 03:20:58,550
action like token transfer or anything
else but the design is about the

7798
03:20:58,550 --> 03:20:58,560
else but the design is about the
 

7799
03:20:58,560 --> 03:21:01,750
else but the design is about the
infrastructure layer literally anyone

7800
03:21:01,750 --> 03:21:01,760
infrastructure layer literally anyone
 

7801
03:21:01,760 --> 03:21:04,950
infrastructure layer literally anyone
can implement any cross chain logic by

7802
03:21:04,950 --> 03:21:04,960
can implement any cross chain logic by
 

7803
03:21:04,960 --> 03:21:08,229
can implement any cross chain logic by
using octagon bridge so uh this is you

7804
03:21:08,229 --> 03:21:08,239
using octagon bridge so uh this is you
 

7805
03:21:08,239 --> 03:21:08,950
using octagon bridge so uh this is you
know

7806
03:21:08,950 --> 03:21:08,960
know
 

7807
03:21:08,960 --> 03:21:11,510
know
as simple as implementing uh i don't

7808
03:21:11,510 --> 03:21:11,520
as simple as implementing uh i don't
 

7809
03:21:11,520 --> 03:21:12,229
as simple as implementing uh i don't
know

7810
03:21:12,229 --> 03:21:12,239
know
 

7811
03:21:12,239 --> 03:21:14,070
know

03:21:23,040 --> 03:21:24,870
no bottleneck no complex uh
questions all you need is just to

7818
03:21:24,870 --> 03:21:24,880
questions all you need is just to
 

7819
03:21:24,880 --> 03:21:27,349
questions all you need is just to
develop a few contracts connect them to

7820
03:21:27,349 --> 03:21:27,359
develop a few contracts connect them to
 

7821
03:21:27,359 --> 03:21:29,590
develop a few contracts connect them to
the actors bridge and you're ready to go

7822
03:21:29,590 --> 03:21:29,600
the actors bridge and you're ready to go
 

7823
03:21:29,600 --> 03:21:31,349
the actors bridge and you're ready to go
your cross chain decentralized

7824
03:21:31,349 --> 03:21:31,359
your cross chain decentralized
 

7825
03:21:31,359 --> 03:21:34,389
your cross chain decentralized
application is done i think it's it's

7826
03:21:34,389 --> 03:21:34,399

7827
03:21:34,399 --> 03:21:36,550
application is done i think it's it's
amazing

7828
03:21:36,550 --> 03:21:36,560
amazing
 

7829
03:21:36,560 --> 03:21:38,469
amazing
nice uh i have a question

7830
03:21:38,469 --> 03:21:38,479
nice uh i have a question
 

7831
03:21:38,479 --> 03:21:40,870
nice uh i have a question
i think in the last update to the bridge

7832
03:21:40,870 --> 03:21:40,880
i think in the last update to the bridge
 

7833
03:21:40,880 --> 03:21:42,630
i think in the last update to the bridge
uh that was announced

7834
03:21:42,630 --> 03:21:42,640
uh that was announced
 

7835
03:21:42,640 --> 03:21:43,750
uh that was announced
um

7836
03:21:43,750 --> 03:21:43,760
um
 

7837
03:21:43,760 --> 03:21:46,790
um
we said that uh we're adding time stamps

7838
03:21:46,790 --> 03:21:46,800
we said that uh we're adding time stamps
 

7839
03:21:46,800 --> 03:21:47,910
we said that uh we're adding time stamps
um

7840
03:21:47,910 --> 03:21:47,920
um
 

7841
03:21:47,920 --> 03:21:50,550
um
on real for relayers and that this was

7842
03:21:50,550 --> 03:21:50,560
on real for relayers and that this was
 

7843
03:21:50,560 --> 03:21:52,790
on real for relayers and that this was
going to pave the way for uh chain-link

7844
03:21:52,790 --> 03:21:52,800
going to pave the way for uh chain-link
 

7845
03:21:52,800 --> 03:21:54,389
going to pave the way for uh chain-link
oracles to be

7846
03:21:54,389 --> 03:21:54,399
oracles to be
 

7847
03:21:54,399 --> 03:21:57,190
oracles to be
uh integrated into the um into the brit

7848
03:21:57,190 --> 03:21:57,200
uh integrated into the um into the brit
 

7849
03:21:57,200 --> 03:21:59,349
uh integrated into the um into the brit
into the octus bridge

7850
03:21:59,349 --> 03:21:59,359
into the octus bridge
 

7851
03:21:59,359 --> 03:22:01,670
into the octus bridge
is what uh

7852
03:22:01,670 --> 03:22:01,680
is what uh
 

7853
03:22:01,680 --> 03:22:03,910
is what uh
a what's the big benefit of adding

7854
03:22:03,910 --> 03:22:03,920
a what's the big benefit of adding
 

7855
03:22:03,920 --> 03:22:05,990
a what's the big benefit of adding
timestamps and then what benefit would

7856
03:22:05,990 --> 03:22:06,000
timestamps and then what benefit would
 

7857
03:22:06,000 --> 03:22:06,870
timestamps and then what benefit would
uh

7858
03:22:06,870 --> 03:22:06,880

bring to the bridge

7862
03:22:11,190 --> 03:22:11,200
bring to the bridge
 

7863
03:22:11,200 --> 03:22:13,190
bring to the bridge
uh yeah let me

7864
03:22:13,190 --> 03:22:13,200
uh yeah let me
 

7865
03:22:13,200 --> 03:22:15,190
uh yeah let me
answer separately for these two

7866
03:22:15,190 --> 03:22:15,200
answer separately for these two
 

7867
03:22:15,200 --> 03:22:18,950
answer separately for these two
questions first of all about the bridge

7868
03:22:18,950 --> 03:22:18,960
questions first of all about the bridge
 

7869
03:22:18,960 --> 03:22:22,790
questions first of all about the bridge
updates uh for now uh when you're uh

7870
03:22:22,790 --> 03:22:22,800
updates uh for now uh when you're uh
 

7871
03:22:22,800 --> 03:22:26,229
updates uh for now uh when you're uh
transferring the events uh to the let's

7872
03:22:26,229 --> 03:22:26,239
transferring the events uh to the let's
 

7873
03:22:26,239 --> 03:22:29,990
transferring the events uh to the let's
say every scale right uh you're passing

7874
03:22:29,990 --> 03:22:30,000
say every scale right uh you're passing
 

7875
03:22:30,000 --> 03:22:32,870
say every scale right uh you're passing
uh we're passing a lot of data but we're

03:51:29,030 --> 03:51:29,040
for example
 

8353
03:51:29,040 --> 03:51:30,710
for example
you can create

8354
03:51:30,710 --> 03:51:30,720
you can create
 

8355
03:51:30,720 --> 03:51:31,510
you can create

03:51:38,309 --> 03:51:38,319
so you can
 

8363
03:51:38,319 --> 03:51:40,790
so you can
swap tokens

8364
03:51:40,790 --> 03:51:40,800
swap tokens
 

8365
03:51:40,800 --> 03:51:45,590
swap tokens
in

8367
03:51:45,600 --> 03:51:47,990

you can send transactions

8368
03:51:47,990 --> 03:51:48,000
you can send transactions
 

8369
03:51:48,000 --> 03:51:52,229
you can send transactions
from metamask and

03:51:52,229 --> 03:51:52,239

 

8371
03:51:52,239 --> 03:51:54,389

swap will be performed

8372
03:51:54,389 --> 03:51:54,399
swap will be performed
 

8373
03:51:54,399 --> 03:51:55,990
swap will be performed

8376
03:51:59,430 --> 03:51:59,440

so
 

8385
03:52:06,000 --> 03:52:09,349
so
for example second task is

8386
03:52:09,349 --> 03:52:09,359
for example second task is
 

8387
03:52:09,359 --> 03:52:15,030
for example second task is
