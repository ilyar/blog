how can I hear
so
so you can’t hear
he
now gave her audible now audible
now it went great
ladies so I brought the presentation on the screen
it’s visible yes it’s visible so let’s start with a small
introduction welcome everyone to our ama
session of crypto itself today us
vladimir to the founder of crypto today
in detail  he will tell you what he does in crypto
in general, in general, he works and
answer the questions of users who
were sent and which you can ask
now right on the u tube
vladimir God bless
you to introduce yourself and tell about the project for free thank you very much for the presentation,
that's right, I'm one of the co-founders of the
armelle company  crypto, we have
several of our key products about
one of them, today I will just
tell you about a specific
insight into the key features of this product, well
, I will conduct a small demonstration of how
it works in practice, and for those who do not
know who we are, we are generally natives  from
data analytics, in general, for many years we have
implemented various  e analytical
projects for large businesses from the
banking industry
from automotive structures from
production and logistics and at the
same time
invested in various
crypto projects, that is, it
was quite close and familiar to us
for a long time and our
professional skills took place
plus a team of these specialists  analysts
allowed us
to build a fairly series of effective
dashboards for the Iberian la version
just became for us such a certain
testing ground that allowed us to
implement the most daring ideas that you
somehow implemented for our customers to one degree or another,
and
plus to realize something that, in principle, is not
the customer always gave us the opportunity to
realize due to certain
commercial relations that we had with
them here, but we allowed ourselves
to create here, let me remind you what is called, in
the end we found
to do what we are very good at doing,
we began to collect data, aggregate
them, process both  quench from various
sources, and moreover, we are talking
not only about transactions that are visible in the
blockchain, but in principle, various
specialized telegram groups, open
forums, and so on, and all these
various sources that we have
accumulated and recently exceeded
a hundred at the moment  we built
various cohorts, divided addresses into a
cluster, and at some point in time
we saw that we had so much data that
it allows us to assemble a full-fledged
commercial product and implement the
ideas that we had, this
product is called internal and the beholder
is a tool  which allows you to
analyze transactions and
addresses of various project exercises,
taking into account the fact that we initially built on the
basis of be a platform the leading bay of platforms
such as clixsense microsoft power bi, but
at the moment we have gone much further,
that is, all the developments that we are in the
process of this way  realized
we were allowed to create our full-fledged
very strong  a product that allows you to
conduct fairly deep
investigations is a whole program an
analytical system
that actually sees where the funds go,
it enriches with additional data
what data I will show you a little later
that as a result we
get a visual graph of connections that
allow you to conveniently analyze
where the funds flow  and
issue in the context of risk addresses via
api so that our partners can
verify the reliability of one or another
counterparty On February 4 this year, we
received a universal grant and since then
quite a lot has been done to
date, our team, including
thirty-five permanent employees
who work every day  work on the
development of this project and what
we get is the principle of a very strong
drive 1
what I would like to note when we talk
about crypto users, for analysis,
as a rule, they use scanners such
as from orsk, such as blockchain trans
can euro scan and  and so on, and the key
issue of all these scanners
is that sometimes there is a lot of data
because of the addresses, it is not entirely
clear who sent the funds where and it
is very laborious to
figure it out and
we have not yet touched on the topic that
users one way or another their tokens are
users  one way or another they
interact with various contracts with more
contracts they send for validation
they send musty king they
send for farming they don’t send
their funds to the dow in order to influence
the decision that is made on the network and
scanners become very difficult
tools to understand what exactly
happened without saying  about when you need to
quickly find the relationship between addresses,
quickly understand what exactly is happening, and
in the connection graph it’s clear and just
wedding that there is each circle, this is the
vertex, conditionally speaking, the address and all the
tokens that it sends the address of
another address, we see seeing one line
but at the same time  we can easily
dive deeper and  see what
transactions directly constituted this
interaction if we have a two-way
interaction, respectively, a double line
will be at the expense of a line that
displays the relationship of this
address with other addresses, of
course we have and not only faith
, we have these three tokens which are
quite a lot and very often it is
necessary to understand  interaction, taking into account
all this information that
we currently have, we have implemented this story
through equivalents, we
directly bring type 3 tokens to dollars,
we bring the carpet in accordance with the
exchange rate on the date of the transaction and
thus we see the equivalent of an example in
dollars, how much one address sent to
another  we see directly in what
currency in this case here 1
transaction was carried out in and sdt here
we actually see the date when this
happened we see which
tokens directly interacted in the exchange between
these two addresses when hovering the
mouse cursor over each specific  th address,
we will also see what
balance it currently has and what is called an
express such soon or what
we currently have, and
then a very interesting thing begins, we give
detailed information about this
address, and we issue information not
only in  in the context of his current balances
that he currently has
in different tokens, but we display
information, including how much
specifically he has in farming,
how much he sent to stating, how much he
has directly in one type or another type
3 currents are not located, we display
information in the context of ari soon when the
first transaction was made we
structure it what we are really
good at understanding it how to
enrich the data in the end we
display information who is behind this
address and this information is
very carefully
verified by compliance officers they collect various
sources there is  always a list of those
sources that confirm
whether this address belongs to one or
another user, we have a
fairly constant work of complaints
officers from a research on the analysis of
clustering this data, we see the
historical balance of how it changed and we
see directly with whom this
user filtered, that is, with whom
this address interacts and relatively
speaking  where we believe that it
has several examples of certain
addresses, we certainly show
information in the context of ri soon and we
would like to show users how
this risk was formed about from which
other addresses with whom
this address interacts in the process of work, how much
it sends to other users
how much he received from smart
distribution contracts how much he sent to
deepcool and how much he sent to
farming how much he sent to many
different sources and we blow what kind of
holistic information and at the same time we also give the
user the opportunity to
look in the context of, for example,
specific transactions and
switch  to read an example in the context of tokens,
how many people interacted with the dts union,
how many interacted through give, and
so on, the
next block is just our very strong
competence, this is aspen enrichment of
information from open sources of
information, we aggregate gigantic
arrays of data, we with them verify their processed data, and
ultimately structure them to give
a holistic picture and the most remarkable thing in
this story is that here we
give our clients the opportunity to specify
one or another address, mark it and the
system will tell him, possibly based
on the entered data,
additional information that he
did not know, for example, in which groups the
user is in which data he has
interests based on various sources
and, accordingly, will create a more
consistent impression regarding the
counterparty with whom he works.
it is also useful to google this or
that address and we do it for the
user automatically, we issue
information in the context of the given address
that we are currently viewing from the point of
view of issuance in the same Google and
plus the mention of this address or
this user in various so
-called data links which  it also allows us
to enrich our information that we
know about the person we have done quite a
lot and what we have done
makes me quite proud of
our product when we showed this
product to our partners there is a
leading analytical platform
clixsense when they saw the whole thing
they invited us as  the speaker to
present here the product that we
got in Kazakhstan, we again
flew the sultan killed, showed how we
conduct crypt investigation of hard
incidents, how we analyze and
pasteurize certain addresses 2 hours, we did not
participate in the second quarter in the
conference technician what was held in
Moscow  at  we have implemented a lot of
things initially, in general, this
product was built on the basis of the bio platform,
but it has long gone beyond the
bio platform as such, we have implemented
our own functionality, our own
platform, which allows an increment to
load data in the context of a transaction
in order to ensure a high
speed of loading information, we
implemented the possibility of saving the
created investigation when we
conduct some kind of audit so
that all this can be saved and returned
to it a little later, we have connected,
in addition to the euro, also various types of inflows by
us now and we are connecting a number of
blockchains, we have created an api for our
clients in order to  they could
receive certain risks this quarter
3 is also going quite well we have
already scheduled for september and the
arrivals in baku in tashkent with this
product in october and november we
have planned london and moscow with
performances where we will present the
whole thing in order to
we are also negotiating with our
colleagues, we are not sure within this
portal, these negotiations have been successfully completed
in order to provide risks in the
context of those addresses of those blockchains with
which they currently interact
and r scale through bridges and to the
current  we have not marked the moment yet,
but it is a matter of time, of course, when
we will start marking, but already at the current
moment, at the final stage, such
negotiations are underway, we have a
lot of work processes related to the
improvement of ari models, soon,
taking into account quite a lot of factors
, we will eventually lead to  models where
for each partner there will be a flexible model
re soon that they can independently
build for themselves what they specifically
need, how they perceive
certain categories of addresses, for example, this is the
same gambling and so on, we are very
actively enriching with various data sets
and marked out simply  huge
number of addresses  various smart
contracts of
couples that you are currently spinning are
happening and this work is happening
every day 35 people
are working on this product every day and we
also have very high expectations of the action of
what will happen next, in
addition to the noted conferences, we also
finalize the product so that the results of ri
soon, which our
users request was recorded in the blockchain, this
can be very important so that
after a while if you are asked
why you decided to work with this or that
address, so that you can show
that in the past I checked this address
and it had a good iori indicator
soon we are improving the
calculation model so that everything works even faster
we are moving towards other
project exercises we automate as much as possible
we will enable our users to
log in using their crypto address
without entering a login password and
many many many other things we have
planned as part of the fact that  we
are doing, we have come
a long way in terms of
implementation,
plus we
have also created a small to be
both for our users, which allows you to
mark up this or that address if you wish, this
will all go directly to us will be
verified and will eventually be
entered  to the database, of
course, we will come up with a
motivational program for those people
who will take an active part
in this process.
Also, I
draw your attention to the fact that in this water we
have a
wonderful option on our website that is to report
some kind of incident if
you have become  a victim of
scammers and scammers have stolen funds from you
, feel free to contact there,
be afraid, it turns out a form that you
can fill out, you can write to us
through our website ask for help, we will
certainly try to help you in
order to find the intruders and
try to return these funds.
what would
you like marks  it’s very sad and ready to answer your
questions, it’s
very sad presentation, but
he forgot at sharam if necessary, I’ll
turn on a video demonstration so that
people can see the
live demo how it all happens how
it happens work in our
tool
but let
’s see this interface in this case is found
in the address  line here or at the address, the
system automatically looks in this
case, it found the user who
owns this address, then it
displays all the colored balls on the connection graph,
which means these are marked addresses,
respectively, we immediately understand by color
what type of address the interaction
in this case, this user is
quite a lot  interacts with
addresses with more distribution contracts
participation in various contests that
were previously
different exchange dex with whom he
interacts purple these are other
users as such on hover
we respectively see his name ivory
score
interaction with each of the addresses the
total amount of interaction we m  we can
click on one address or another if
we want to see what interactions with whom the
next address can
move the position accordingly is
saved so that we can
visually compose a
certain route, as we are used to, as
it is convenient for us, we can sometimes
encounter such a situation when there are a lot of
addresses  and we have to work with this somehow,
there are several options,
either a filter by amount, or a filter by
time, or a filter by different types of
addresses, for example, we don’t want to see that a
person interacts with more
distribution contracts and we want to
let’s exclude him, we accordingly
choose what to exclude and remain  all the
rest, you can select certain
specific addresses when we clearly know
what we want to find any user
opens the system automatically
rebuilds the
visualization so that it can be
placed as if for a more optimal location,
but in this case, the example shows
quite a lot of smart contracts
connected  connected with the token swap in our own
and we turn them off there, and now it is simplified in the
perception of all information, a very big
job is done by our guys, compliance
officers who place, among other things,
smart contracts that are responsible for the
return of commissions, because if
we look
at certain transactions for
certain  the addressee can be thousands
hundreds tens of thousands of transactions and it
is not entirely clear with whom this user is
interacting,
and when there is a specific signature that this
address is responsible for returning part of the commission
when making this or that exchange, it
immediately becomes clear that there is no point in
researching in that direction because
there is no  there is no valuable information, for example,
depending on your task, you
can see right here a
certain risk it express and at the same time
you can also fall into the card to
see all the information that
you displayed as part of the presentation, in
this case we see that quite
large funds were sent
users in the dow, respectively, a
person takes an active enough
part in making a decision and a verst or
a lot of such things and who
initiated who graduated this address with whom
it is interconnected what other
addresses in this cluster can be searched by
address can be searched by name can be
searched by  many other parameters
in order to answer some of your
questions like so
very much
it can look almost 1 comment
let's move it to different so questions
so the
first user asks the
question I am a regular
user and anza
vestment shares how do I avoid the controller on the
disk great question  in fact, the
correct operation in the blockchain and it
is very important because if you
accept non-dating funds today and in
the end it turns out to be dirty
funds, you may have a certain
problem problems of what nature the
first these funds can be
blocked by the exchange this time you
may have  questions with
pr  if these
funds were stolen somehow
there is a statement to the law enforcement
agencies and the law enforcement agencies are
sent to the exchange this information
you will need to explain who what
how and so on and what is even worse
is that if you accept to your
main address  all funds and these
funds will turn out to be involved in some
not very pleasant cases; in fact, your
clean funds will mix with dirty
funds and your risk
will worsen  addresses
for transactions, even if it turns out
that something is wrong with these addresses,
at least you don’t stain your fixed assets,
and we certainly recommend
checking those counterparties with whom you
work in order not to get
unnecessary risks by
sowing to new addresses, this is
really very worthwhile  advice
from the author good evening  the product is really
very cool and how to get access to it
what about privacy not all
users want their addresses to be
published and it can be punishable
great question means see the first one
at the moment this product is
being tested in a closed circle i.e.
certain clients have already gained access
to  to this tool, you can write
us a request via mail, we will
individually consider each such
request unconditionally
2 pascal please, the second part of the question
there were several points
about the privacy of the built-in one,
so look, we use open
data sources, that is, in fact, we
simplify the process that
users can do this  that is, all this
information is not some kind of our
secret data as such, we simply
simplify the process as much as possible and
automate the collection of data from the Internet
and their structuring, therefore, from the point of
view of the law, there is no
violation here,
and if the user wants to stay
anonymous it is absolutely his right
I respect this right very much and moreover he
just has to observe a certain
digital hygiene in the process of work I
know specific people who
want to remain anonymous they
simply do not remain anonymous and declare
certain due
precautions if they do not want to
publish any of their own  personal
information is quite real tasks
and
what tools do you use when
collecting data about
in fact we use a lot of
different data from
clustering to studying the
patterns of behavior patterns, plus
we structure the information
that is currently and so presented in the
public domain the question is simply  its
proper processing, rallies and
enrichment, by and large, what
exactly we do our companies with
officers use ebay systems and
many different scripts that
automatically process the whole thing,
they use those open sources
that everyone has  how many of you have just in a
convenient way the whole thing is displayed on the
ogres of communication
with
whether you have a large staff of
analytics I believe that our team
is currently small 35 people
who are currently working full-
time on this product but we are
quite
ambitious  taking into account the plans that
we have set, taking into account the
tasks that we are facing, we are
now expanding very actively, and looking at
how our team is being modified, our
team is directly taking pride in the fact
that it’s really cool,
very strong specialists, we recently
got a very strong
mathematician programmer who  teaching to significantly
improve the rice cortex system, we have
a data engineer who, due to the
correct database architecture,
speeds up the process of work or the
service itself, we have simply
outstanding guys who are well
versed in analytics work
professionally work
bio tools reveals certain
new patterns  ty and almost
every week I heard about some
small breakthrough of us, moreover, the
team also got a habit every
Friday we are going to call up
our team is very large and it
is actually spread around the world and we call up and
exchange certain significant
achievements that we have made in  within the framework of the
past week as a whole for the team, it’s not
that very invigorating event,
realizing that this and this and this is done, but
it’s really cool,
plus for us, in order for the guys to work more
efficiently, the return was not the
maximum from these thirty-five
people who are currently  yes,
we have a mandatory internal
training system, all of us guys study
blockchain technologies because guys come to us
with varying degrees of training
and are not programmers and the date the satanists themselves,
as sometimes they don’t joke with us, and we
give everyone clear and understandable tools, we
tell how it works  so that
they better understand the end
user who works  with this
tool and who is on the other side of the addresses
here you can immediately
attach the following to this question what specialists
do you need how to get on your team
we have a career section you can
write there there is already a
certain one at the moment 6 if my memory serves me right
vacancies in the end
all of these vacancies all of the resumes of which
we receive goes to our enchant
manager enchant manager analyzes
accordingly contacts you in
order to further determine how
strong you are and how you can be useful within the
framework of this product how we can
be useful
to you come  we will always be happy to
super before
we send a link to the site so the next
question is
if the method if from the most if the most
effective way to get the scammer
to return pokie to the
deceased evil is dynamization
is called this is the most effective way
that
allows you to return funds funds
can be returned in different ways you can return
funds to the floor sometimes thanks  it’s
just that when you
communicate there are no words, nor are we exclusively for the
legal side of this issue
when you communicate with a person when you
explain that a person stumbled and
it’s better to return the funds we have
precedents where people returned the
funds were identified as scammers
we brought the
victim together as a result we talked
acted as mediators in these negotiations
, in the end, we did not go to apologize and
return the funds together such cases,
but if a
person does not want to return the funds,
there is always a law, we already have
certain materials on the site what
to do if you have stolen the crypt
there are specific links
where to turn depending on the exchange as a
whole if you find yourself in such a situation,
please contact consultations we will help you
tell you what to do how
to respond quickly to this therefore please contact
us we will always be happy
to help  aim or
crypto with mixers does not work we are very
fast  we are moving towards technologies
that will allow us to
work with this quite effectively and I
will certainly show the calculated time, but
globally I feel quite
good about
this, this is my personal position, because if a
person wants to remain
confidential and does nothing of the sort,
I believe that he has the right
to remain  confidential if his
choice to be used by mixers I respect
him this choice of
face mixers was also
possible to understand the situation side to the beach
is it considered bad or good that the language of the
discussion on this matter is because it allegedly
slowed down the technology development of
technology but at the same time how would
you know  there is, for example, a hammer, I
consider it a little current as a tool for
just hammering nails, and someone
may consider a hammer as a
tool to beat people and of
course I condemn if a
person uses mixers
to launder dirty dirty money, then
I relate to this  it's bad if a person
uses it for that  o in order to remain
anonymous, I feel good about this,
what is happening now on the docash side, it’s
difficult for me to somehow comment on behalf of a
ml crypto, I think that the
system that equalizes all needs
is wrong, it seems to me that
some more flexible
mechanism of work should be used,
perhaps partial regulation
participants in order for us to remain
in the legal field
where it will be possible to prove, relatively speaking, the
purity of the funds that I bring to the
mixer without disclosing my own
identity, and
I believe that in this approach I have the
right to maintain confidentiality,
but regarding the fact that the developers
specifically closed this, I certainly
condemn  this is an equalization, relatively
speaking,
they are trying to impose a certain
decision by force instead of sitting down at the
negotiating table and discussing in discussions
how to prevent
laundering it by laundering funds through
mixers while maintaining anonymity,
so if we are talking about the arrests of
developers, of course I
I feel bad about it
so more questions no
question answered the
hair wants to add something at the end of the
next month and a half we will also have
one very interesting announcement of a product
that will allow us to
work efficiently with scammers and it
will make skill games less attractive
to them for the next two months this is in
within the framework of the work of our company, this is not
a beholder product, this is a separate product and
it will be very interesting and it
will actually allow almost everyone to
use it a very interesting
solution will I don’t want to
tell you ahead of time what its essence is, but
those people who took part in the
discussions of this  product in
providing feedback, they
highly appreciated it, we just
have a lot of requests
regarding various crypto incidents
before and not only about or once the key we
have a fairly large advertising
campaign in the whole world, we
have studied so many cases of
fraud directly over the past six months  in  when you wonder
how inventive these scammers
are in the process of coming up with schemes and we
understand that some schemes that
have long existed in the crypto world
are slowly beginning to penetrate
into the
Iberian one, this saddens us,
but we intend to deal with this
now, moreover, a rather interesting one will appear on the site
the section that
will be devoted to such an interesting
example of crypto fraud, some
examples just concern even the
scale game, that is, people asked us for
help to
figure it out, unfortunately people made
quite
stupid mistakes, they made the transmission of the seed
phrase, although they were quite intelligent guys,
but due to the fact that they believed that it was  there was
a technical support employee, they
provided him with information by filling out a Google
form,
we are like that,
we will probably cover the frame, then we
will interact with you and what cases
can be additionally published
in our various telegram groups
so that more users can and
get acquainted with  different schemes
fraud there are quite
interesting cases in general, we try to write
interesting enough so that the average
user would be curious to read yes,
I think this is some kind of serious
community in order to increase the
education of cryptocurrency storage security
, we have articles already ready, they
will be released this week, so what
will come out if  if you want, I can send you
links so that
those who are interested can
get acquainted with the
sound is gone
yes, let's say let's
get it here we are just sending a
parcel to
someone who asked to get into the team
here we go Rome will tell the community is
healthy, well
thank you to joke that you
presented said very cool  xenu
moving
straight very much the site I look very beautifully
updated also looked stopped
thank you super thank us thank you
thank you sharply and happily
