put recording on
yeah so once again there is a
free condex implementation stage 2
contest that is ending
tomorrow so and there is still no
submissions uh which is surprising for
me
uh so i kind of yes yes please
we're kind of participating there is
some noise
so with your signal
um i'm saying we couldn't participate
because we didn't have time to
participate in that contest
unfortunately okay that's a pity
and and as for all others i see sway dev
team here so will you publish your
submission guys
yeah as usual last moment okay
okay just please don't wait until the
very last moment so i don't think that
it really will create some advantage to
other participants but
uh you may miss your moment uh okay
friday time is the best time to work
with the submission
yeah yeah i remember before i delete
this we all know what is this
oh sorry i thought it's uh it's uh it's
a stable coin
i don't know maybe yeah yeah okay yeah
we will submit something yeah
what time is it ending tomorrow uh i
don't see online live let me check on
the easy votes
um it's 12 o'clock utc so it's like 3
a.m saturday
oh okay full day tomorrow okay
yeah but we have it we have it written
that just
need to yeah make a submission okay fine
thanks maybe maybe we can
yeah please do please do because the
more we have the better
and uh by the way uh those of you who
visited the cross chain meet up in
moscow
so maybe hearing that
for example cosmos and tender means so
they have
not released their decks yet so actually
so
the speed at which we are moving so it's
fascinating they
we already did the bigger progress and
the whole project
for four years of course they have some
their own peculiarities of their
architecture and so on so forth but
still uh we have at least ten decks
that's operational now
which is fascinating uh okay let's let's
move on for
for contests uh we launched the uh
london and borrowing se
uh so which is aimed to
better understand of possible and
impossible mechanics
on london and borrowing and comparison
to those
existing protocols on ethereum
so what is the difference what can be
imported
what can be reused what cannot and why
so uh
if you feel yourself capable so please
participate and
the more ideas we collect the better
will be the
specification of the implementation
contest
uh next uh the free terms of sovereign
identity framework stage one
uh is ending in five days so uh there is
also no submissions yet um
uh vladimir kanin maybe you have
uh some updates if there are any teams
who will be participating
yes i certainly know that the two or
three teams will participate
as far as i helped
one of them and two or three two or
three i know hope three
which i know and probably we spread some
information in the ssi community
they strongly believe that one and two
submissions more which i don't know yet
but they will do okay
yeah all of them asking what's the best
strategy to
to to apply that for the last minutes or
not so i say
it's much better to apply a few days
prior or a few hours pray or at least
not the last yeah just in case if they
uh
right difficulties so you can just
forward them to me it will help
so no problems and also i
kindly ask you to discuss with them uh
the ama session so because ssi is
something
quite new to us and it would be great if
they can
present their works uh especially there
are not so many works expected
so probably it will be good do you mean
priority ending or
during the submission no no no no no
after after the submission period
is ended of course of course uh so
and to facilitate jurors work so we will
invite them to to present their wounds
yeah next uh there were two more active
contests which uh oracle contest and
testaton
contest they there is still enough time
uh
21 days and 46 days accordingly
so nothing to say here so there's still
a bunch of time
uh okay so let's move to the next topic
of today's agenda
uh there is actually two updates
from from our site uh from the brock's
site first of all and from freeton defy
line site
so the first one is about the ethereum
bridge uh
we are approaching actually the
implementation of a dell model
and uh it will use the native
bridge governance token and so it's
named bridge
for simplicity uh yeah and uh
just i will briefly explain uh how it
works and
sergey will uh dive a bit deeper into
the
uh economic part so actually uh
we analyzed uh all the popular dao
models that are currently being used in
uh
especially in fritz on uh sorry in
ethereum
network and we try
to take the best parts of it
so actually what is bridge talking uh
about you will need this
of course if you want to become a relay
a relay
if you remember it's a special note that
checks and transfers the value uh
from one network to another so there can
be
at maximum 100 relays in one epoch
and they are competing with each other
at the
elect a kind uh auction so uh
with the stakes so those
100 with the highest stakes will be
elected for the next
epoch and epochs they last for one week
to facilitate this uh there will be a
separate interface
for staking that can be used not only by
relay
nodes of course but also
by regular talking owners and
these tokens can be staked there and
those tokens that will be staked there
and only those
will be eligible for dividends
participation
uh the liquidity that is uh controlled
by the breach
will be used as we explained a bit
earlier
in the low risk protocols
like other like compounds and on
freetown site
we're also thinking about something
similar and
as we expect on a monthly basis the
earned dividends from these protocols
will be withdrawn
and distributed between the bridge token
holders that stake them in the special
interface
the difference of the relayer and the
regular
bridge token holder uh will be that
for relayer he should
lock his take for a period of at least
one month this is
needed for protection from the
bad guys and in case somebody layer
starts behaving in a
bad manner so he will be slashed and his
stake will be
also redistributed among other bridge
talking holders
uh we will also create
at least two pairs one with a
double tone and another one with double
btc
at tons for payon especially this is
needed for those who would like to
purchase this token either for
participating in in the relay network or
in just for staking purposes
uh as for the dividends part uh
so fifty percent of it will be
redistributed
among relayers proportionally to the
stake and 50
will be uh distributed among all token
holders
bridge token holders uh so this is
uh a good reason to be a relay actually
yeah and
that's that's where we expect a good
competition
and also that's why we believe that
the token uh price will be organically
pushed up
and this is a good economic economic
tool
so again i will i will give you the word
in a while uh another announcement is
that
uh we are very very close to agreement
with two big protocols
from ethereum network uh
i think we will announce them quite soon
so they will appear of course in the
bridge and
the tokens can be easily ported through
the bridge from ethereum network
and also they will help us with lots of
announcements and
attracting the the audience
uh yeah so now now sergey is your turn
please yeah yeah uh so say about
about bridge how it will be work uh
during
near to one month uh it will be on the
deep five token
yes and uh yes and we will launch
farming program
with uh bridge token and uh vietnam
double farming
and when we will finish audit
our dow contracts uh we will move to
full dao with relays
we got new eight relays
it's uh different funds who bought
talking on our private round
and also good use for community
we will create some tokens to airdrop
between users who was earlier
testers in bridge and users
who work in dex
and i think i will launch
uh first liquidity liquidity pool today
uh bridge and baton
and without any farming it's only sunny
for fun
yeah and then
we'll finish how do we did and we will
launch bridge like
now with eight independent relays
i think it will be a big
stone in uh in the fire in phoenix
system
uh because i explained bridge model to
a lot of different people fans
and defy gamers and uh
it's like i would say um
your finance placer and btc in one model
and it's uh it's fresh
and and uh a lot of and i think we will
attract
more than 100 million rapidity up to
september
and uh end of eighth i would like a
system
will will be visible on
the fire landscape
thank you sergey yeah and uh
what's what's important is that
we do not plan actually to launch the
dow as sergey said before the security
audit is over and uh we already
mentioned that
there was the first uh round of security
audits that
uh inspected our current source code and
you may have seen some updates coming
uh around the bridge when we upgraded
the bridge to the second version
uh so we fixed some some bugs that were
found by auditors
and uh hopefully after the second uh
second round we'll
take much less time because
guys already familiar with our source
code and
it will be easier for them to to inspect
it
yeah and uh also that's why uh we
decided
to combine the third and the fourth
stage of the bridge implementation into
one
so uh i think i will push to the draft
of the contest
uh either today or tomorrow uh because
we actually decided
not to uh split
it into two to two stages uh
of the distribution of relay
responsibilities and
uh economics and slashing and rewards
but rather combine it into one
and make the bridge operational faster
uh yeah i think that's pretty easy
about the bridge again maybe if you have
something else that
soon soon so yeah yeah yeah we will uh
we prepared a big pr company uh with a
lot of announcements with partnership
different protocols
with bridge launch tokens
and some interview and
it will be public okay alex please
hi guys sergey hi um can you
explain a little bit more i didn't
understand about
eight relay notes it will be
you go to um production when
will be eighth notes then no no no about
about it
notes you have already
no no no no it's it's a it's it's
different topic uh
if you want to become uh relay notes uh
you need to put 100 000
bridge tokens
yes on stake uh in in private sale one
token
was two dollars and it's uh two hundred
thousand dollars
and eight different funds bought tokens
and uh they will be in just relay
they participate in this round and you
have yes
yes yes yes yes some private
uh company person
[Music]
private uh some some company from the
file yarns
and some private funds one fund
one fund from from china one from from
switzerland
and uh it's it's it's it's a big story
yeah
it's interesting i understand thank you
yes
yeah and actually so uh we will put
uh sergey said some uh bridge tokens in
the
the free circulation uh of course so
that uh
anyone willing could purchase it
and also we will uh run an airdrop
among those users who helped us in
testing
in uh experiencing the first versions of
our products and
indicating at some difficulties at
errors
and trusting us with the liquidity and
yes and also we will uh put somewhere
drop in
the vice of governance members and defy
jury
and in defy aliens
yeah and uh also i i want to uh
add that sergey just maybe said this
slightly but actually our farming
contract
is currently being upgraded so that it
can now support
the multi-currency farming meaning that
if you
put your lp tokens to the farm
uh you actually get rewarded not in one
currency like double tone but rather
in several ones and we will direct
uh some portion of this bridge tokens
also to our farming programs
and uh people who are staking their
liquidity so
they will also get some of these tokens
um one more question about airdrop or
something else for jewelry
etc
[Music]
how better to use these tokens it will
be some depools
or it's more about no it's not it's uh
to model i will i will launch trading
today it
uh of course our airdrop will be not not
today
i think i think as the big liquidity
pulls we will stop on next week
and uh it will be possible to buy bridge
talking or to sell british talking
all you can join with uh
another people from the face of
governance or another people who will
get their job
and it will be possible to launch
some relay notes if you will be able to
join
uh like the pool you mean
yes that's maybe like like
like the pool we do not actually have um
the pool kind of staking when several
people can participate to fund
the relay note yet maybe we'll think
about this in future
but if you have some good relationships
with people who you trust
so you can just combine your tokens to
run
the software and maybe multi-sig
wallet like yes yes yes why not why not
by the way
uh it's a good solution if you have
multi-sick wallets controlled by several
people
so uh you can put your tokens just in
one
place and use them to to run the relay
mode and this is exactly what we were
saying about
[Music]
i think couple of months ago there was a
lot of questions
so how people uh could become these
relay nodes and at that moment of time
uh we didn't have the clear picture
because we were in the
very deep market research so when trying
to
understand how the mechanics and
economics will look like
and now we found this solution and we
checked it with
some some market leaders so if they
are interested in this and
i think this will be some novelty to the
market and that will
attract attention to the whole free tone
okay uh very good uh
any other questions guys please
how do you gonna promote it over the
market
it's a game please i think it's your
turn
yes i i closed private private round so
it's
uh and
and it was totally oversell because
i have more for more funds that we have
slots in relays
about about about promotion
our pr manager in brooks australia she
will prepare
some describe and document and
she will spread it in community and
of course it will create some
publication and uh
any member from our community who want
to help uh
can join us in this yes of course and we
also have some already some questions
from from journalists
asking for some questions but i think
that we will
officially announce about this uh later
this week
after the first round is formally closed
and yeah after that we will
see a great greater flow of newcomers to
the free time
yeah thank you
by the way speaking about the contest
guys uh if you are a jury
in defy so you are eligible to judge
also the
browser extension contest in the main
governance
so uh i already pinged you in the
morning
but just to remind you again that please
go and vote there is only one day left
and there are a whole bunch of good
solutions i i really enjoyed that
this contest it overcame my expectations
and we've got
a lot of good working products good
extensions
and this is in principle uh very good
for
the whole ecosystem so please go and
cast your votes to those who you think
deserve it
yeah there is a 21 submissions third of
its the
the some mistakes or
copycat or even even duplicated
each other but never mind the half of
it's very interesting and i'm
already in the middle of the process of
it
very good very good please because i
really liked it
i could not vote because brock's team
also participated with its solution
but i really can mention that there are
some
very decent solutions so that have the
uh a good implementation and deserves a
place in the market absolutely
by the way by the way isn't it most
active the contest in the freezer i mean
the contest with the development of the
code or something probably you
glad or probably media no isn't it the
most active
or in 21 submissions
not sure not sure because uh there were
quite a number of developer contests and
uh if we remember the uh
buildings to town sdk uh i think
it was a bigger number actually
but they were written different
languages of course um
and maybe there were some good contests
for devops
engineers so uh but but yes this one
is very good and fresh so i really
enjoyed it
anyway anyway it's one of the most
active
hands if it's about the chrome extension
i mean the browser extension
so it's about the end user solution
absolutely yeah
it's one of the uh i would say
one more proof that we need end user
oriented solutions right
not the terminal the command line
solution yeah
of course the more interfaces are better
because people
but actually uh i i am thinking about
having some good website
where you can find all of this solution
because right now uh
all of them are quite uh
quite unknown to a wider user because
the
there is no one website where you can
find all of them
uh oh no let me comment it's actually
free tom or
it should be a catalogue and it should
be pavel it should be
of course it is almost there so
and by the way you know we uh
roma ron they made a couple of times
request for cards because in order to be
placed in cataloging you to
create your card with wording explaining
what what the solution is about
with a link to your website or whatever
you want
and they got only a few uh replies so
okay you know i've never seen i've never
seen this by the way
can they kill me please yeah yeah we
will we'll do it
one more or not so the idea is that uh
i i literally go to different teams and
say guys prepare your card
for the catalog so you you will be on on
the
my website and the link on your side so
absolutely absolutely
i want to do this just ask them to to
contact me and yeah they don't provide
by the way
because we've never known about this by
the way
there's some some issue in the
information flow i think
okay we'll talk with roma today again
yes please repeat
uh okay okay very good and by the way um
i triggered one interesting discussion
uh i
i took personal responsibility for this
it's about
the payment link standards uh actually
i think that our ecosystem is uh
well grown enough to discuss such
questions
and uh as there are uh already more than
a dozen
of uh wallet solutions in the market
supporting freetown
um i prepared a draft of of the standard
it is very similar to vip 20 and 21
and it it's focused uh only on
payment purpose as the most frequent one
and
it's very very close and similar to the
bitcoin payment links and ethereum
payment links but
uh taking uh the account some free ton
uh possibilities we already had some
discussions with
with some people from community but if
you didn't have a chance to have a look
on it
and uh either say that it's good so
maybe provide some comments
uh so plea please it's a tip five it's
on the forum for it on the torque so uh
just have a look and if you have some
solutions that rely on
[Music]
on the transferring tones i think it
will be
very good for all of us to support one
standard
be universal um
yeah a minute of self-promotion ended
thank you
uh yeah that's pretty from my site for
today so if you
have some some additional topics to
discuss so just raise your hand
i just launched uh
pool very good
bridge tokens and with and
so now it's possible oh call community
to start
brilliant let's go
yeah yes yes please
have a little question just another
historical contest
basically uh i i i think
it should be addressed to meet you but
maybe someone else
can answer so uh
did if if looking to cut the specs
through a few formulas and
in this formulas there are parameters uh
like we need to kind of participants
need to define
by themselves or experiment with it and
this this variables include for example
the
the word for the oracle
uh the like basic reward they also the
feed like price feed ram
which is kind of an obvious and as well
as
several else like for example magic
constant a
which is like a uh maybe a speed of
of growing reputation for oracle but but
whatever
uh maybe some someone uh
already like uh uh
get get some kind of uh um
kind of good values for that to to make
to make uh
first experiments because like uh
maybe someone can share how
how to evaluate them
it's a place here
um sorry i didn't get the question i
didn't think it was for me
yeah i i'm asking about oracle
kind of contest it's based on another on
paper and yes
there are some constant variables like
hard to kind of determine
and to make like experiments with
current
kind of smart contracts which i want to
like test
against the real price feeds uh i
just just asking for maybe you know some
kind of
good values for start for example
a reward time frame
for example how fast should the elector
run
the coming trivial phase for example
no i i don't because it's need to be
like tested and uh
so it's up to the you know
up to the implementer okay so it's
inside the contest okay right
yeah like we didn't we didn't run the
test
simulation on that so you know
try
okay any other questions guys please
yeah it's also quite unclear where
should we
like get where should how how
the knots are minted because like
it's not in a paper uh i suppose or
maybe i
read it bad leave but like
oracle's receives reward in knots but
how
uh how kind of they
why not just english just a smart
contract
and uh there is a reserve
which which you trade against in the in
the
like there is an auction right or where
it means the tokens in the auction
so um somewhere there
is it is it an auction for what like i'm
i'm supplying the price fit and
now i need to kind of buy for that price
of what
um it's in the paper fine okay
i need to just just thought through
because like i stopped on the auction
what auction like
i'm not trading i'm just like supply
there isn't there is an auction that
determines the
final price of the of the knot
of it not to turn conversion and so
like you participate in this auction to
to if you want to get
like the tokens so that's where the
final price is determined
but the details are in the paper
you can read it yeah they got it they
reach
they reach balanced price based on
previous medium price like okay
yeah i i got it maybe maybe
maybe i got it okay thank you
very good
something else guys please
okay seems now uh by the way uh
tonight uh at 7 p.m moscow time we will
be distributing the reward for the
police dot stage 3 contest
and this is just a kind reminder for
those who are custodians just please
be online to sign the transaction
so uh that's pretty from our site so and
traditional three two
one no questions okay guys thank you so
much for attending for today uh
let's talk again as usual you know in
one week
so and have a nice weekend
bye bye thank you bye
