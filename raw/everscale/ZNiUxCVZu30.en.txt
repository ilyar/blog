hey
now do you see me yeah
cool
oh cool hi guys
okay yeah so do you hear me
we do yeah we yes we
[Music]
nice perfect
let's just wait for a few more people to
show up
okay
hello
hello hello how
doodly
just waiting for some more folks
where's mita
where's
alex
let me dm a few people
sorry for the malay folks just need a
couple more people to come
hang on
almost there sorry for the delay
you
all right looks like we're going to be
without technical updates today uh me to
just uh
uh explain that he's not going to be
here so i think we'll start without them
which will actually shorten the call so
make it a little
a little quicker which i think is fine
all right so uh hi everybody welcome to
everscale community call number 94. uh
besides the um
uh usual that we have which would have
been technical updates and uh also we're
certainly going to have ben's bits we
have uh
some really really interesting stuff
today so we have uh metaverse project
that we're going to talk about
uh we have uh two
brand new everscale startup competition
winners uh that uh are joining us to
talk about their projects and both are
really really interesting uh and uh yeah
so i guess uh let's go ahead and get
started now normally we start to call
like i said with an introduction uh to
the latest technical updates but i just
got word from mita that there
are none so
um we're gonna hop right in and start
maybe with um
let's call it a sociocultural experiment
uh that's being created by a gentleman
that goes simply by the name of dadar um
dadar is uh an independent metaverse uh
designer uh an artist
and he's working alongside both
everscale and freeland i think we all
remember freeland i know a lot of people
have been asking questions what what's
up with them uh we're going to find out
now
uh and they're going to create the first
metaverse metastate mvp on our
blockchain
so data
if you're ready you can start us off
please go ahead
nice so thank you for having me and
this social cultural experiment is not
mine it's a freelance uh
one one moment so ah yeah do you see my
screen
we most certainly do
yes perfect so uh this is not my project
this project was found by uh
uh creators of uh mr freeman so if you
heard about uh freeland uh you must uh
already knew about mr freeman in all
those
episodes
and if you want to understand the mind
uh
behind the freeland you you must see all
those
videos about
our modern way of life
and since
2018 i tried to build a
game um a platform so we can build uh
the real freeland as it was said in uh
in the episode seven uh it doesn't exist
in english but you can watch it on a
russian channel
uh with subs and this is where uh mr
freeman says uh
that he gave uh he gave us a hint to to
build a new world and this hint is a
game
as he said this way
yeah so and for me it was uh uh so
obvious that we need to gamify uh
the governance because i'm
i'm working as a designer uh since uh to
2012 and uh i already working for uh
some startups and i know how the
gamification of companies work and i
think we can't give me
the governance and uh freeland is this
it's something where we can uh
uh merge with the meta versus games dao
and all this new kind of stuff uh on our
on different blockchain and this is why
i started to build it for for them i
tried to build some stuff on
on top of in rail
engine but it was uh quite difficult
because it
it wasn't well adapted for a web
so i tried to to to search other uh
stuff other uh plugins that i can use to
build this and this is where i uh i run
into uh ready player me and this is uh
this is a project that exists since uh
last year i guess uh and this is
something that we in the web3 we we want
to see uh
uh this is where we everyone can build
can make their own avatar uh
thanks to
to face recognition you can make a
a photo of yourself and uh plotting into
that and
after that this platform can make you
your own avatar and uh even you can
build your own
so you can see uh this way all my other
avatars
and when i found that i thought that it
was uh some it was a
revolution
because everyone can build
their own identity and
explore other worlds and you can
discover all apps uh like vr chat live
all this uh all those projects are uh
working well uh the avatar that you see
right now here i use it uh i i made it
with a
red player me and connected it with an
image so actually it plugged it to obs
and uh
and this is uh all the all the choices
here right now this is uh thanks to
radio player me and animes and this is
where i'll also i discovered mona and
mana this is for me is a real revolution
in meta versus because this is uh this
is uh
the place where everyone who know how to
use unity uh can build his own space and
uh since the beginning of this year they
started an event called um
the renaissance of the meta of the
metaverse just let me show you that
so yeah that was an event that started
in first january and uh finished at uh
the end of the month and i
many designers uh so amaya was um
using their um
their platform to build our own
metaverse so uh
there is all uh kind of materials that
you can explore it just uh click on it
and you're you're welcome
on that
so there is no sound this is this is a
metaverse built by uh
uh attends
one one second there is just uh many
dairy yeah
no problem
yeah uh so
you can explore any of them and
my uh
so there is my tests i tried to build a
freelance
an mvp of real and something that can uh
actually
work as freelance and
the results was pretty good
so here we are this is uh i call it in
that
freeman gallery
so in all the stuff are interactive i
can uh i i
can talk to mr freeman
if it would work yeah i can talk to him
and he will uh i can
go to his channel thanks to to the link
uh all
all the stuff uh we call it artifacts
and they are working as
hyperlinks in the standard web so any
image i can i can attach it to
an enft and uh people can just buy it
and uh when you buy all the
any of uh nfcs or from freeland uh all
this money will uh
go to build the freeland uh
and uh today you can actually own your
own uh
passport and print them
uh if you go to this link
here you can be you can buy the
freelance passport and uh
after that you can
just
fulfill um
[Music]
how to say to fulfill a formula to ask
for printing of your prior passport and
the nfc that you have a will be burnt
and you will receive another nft
also the new
[Music]
digital version of your passport and all
of those metaphors can be accessed with
a special token so i can uh make this
world accessible only for uh
for
for those who have the passport of
freeland
and this is it was just an experiment so
for those who are
um
are already both uh their passport on
every scale they will uh
also have access to it but actually
there is no enough people to
um
to to do that there is only uh the grand
bazaar team who are on it so you can uh
buy uh the the passport on every scale
uh on grand bazaar but actually it's
pretty difficult to to exchange your uh
this uh uh um every scale token uh uh
and to ask the printing and uh actually
um
the developers from every scale are
talking with developers from mona to
make bridges so this is something uh
that's already on
on rails
um and uh
yeah this this was just a test for me
and uh when i saw that
it works uh i try to make other stuff
like my own metaverse for me
and this is uh
this is also another experiment i call
it the international metastation like as
international cosmos station
yes
and here
here i just look at
first moment yeah so and here we are we
can see all those projects that i
support that i think they kind of change
the world and if we connect uh all of
them each other we can uh do something
more but just uh money and so you can
hear uh see a grand bazaar on our other
hsa nfc like a partner
of
a
xl x ever labs
or ever ever labs
nice okay so uh this is you you you can
uh
access to all those
sites
from this metaverse so there is a ton
labs or i will rename it uh
to everex
so in
this is how it works
it's freaking cool as hell
it's awesome yeah
this is uh the missing part of a
metaverse because everyone uh er when
somebody talk about metaverse they talk
about meta about facebook about
all those big companies but
we need to understand that metaverse
will
have to say
it's uh it's possessed by people who
build it so if you let those big company
build their metaverse you will uh
so you will be centralized you will you
will not be able to guard your identity
for you but
mana this is an alternative that we need
to ipod
it is it's
hosted with epfs so i can mint this
metaverse and all those uh information
all those uh image are actually uh
already on uh on epfs and all those
textures uh uh
also they
they are already on epfs and uh in
theory no nobody can uh destroy it or
censor it
the only only problem here is just that
it's uh it's hosted by a mona gallery
itself and if somebody wants to attack
by ddos
the mana gallery it will not be accessed
uh and this is something on what they
are already working
and i think every blockchain every uh
every yeah every blockchain must to
start to build something like this and
the beauty here also the beauty of
monoverse is that it is uh enter
inter
operable so i can build uh this
metaverse and uh those herbs that you
see this is actually portals and i
um if somebody already minted his
metaverse on the on the blockchain i can
access it through that i i
didn't mean to my metaverse uh for now
because i had some issues i
i that i actually repairing but
i think this in a in the end of this
week i will mean that and i will be able
to to connect this metaverse to others
and like uh
yeah i connected this this materials to
another genesis gallery this is a
gallery of uh mona uh this is not that i
built so this is it was it was built
by the team itself
at the beginning
actually i can't return because
they're
they're not connected uh
that
for the moment but i can visit another
metabolism and this is how we uh
how we can uh
build in worlds infinitely and without
borders
so uh this is uh this is it yeah it's
it's fantastic uh mike drop you did
that's awesome absolutely awesome and of
course we immediately have questions um
so uh joanna i thought you had one
i did i did have a question but he ended
up answering it okay when i was reading
but i'm also
curious
because i checked out the mona and it's
it's f you know it's based on ethereum
and so how how can we use
evers in this if it's if we're using
their servers
technology yeah yeah and just um so the
team of our grand buzzer are already
talking with
uh with mana so they can build a
bridge but uh in in the car of a mona if
you go to the
to their sites about
they talk that
they try to build a
blockchain agnostic metaverse so
they don't eat on top of ethereum just
because it is something that is
used everywhere and actually i can mean
or on ethereum on or on a polygon at
this moment so i hope uh the grand
bazaar team and uh team from mona will
uh
will do their best to build the
the connection to everscale that's it's
really fantastic i love this so much so
if if everybody has a passport we could
just come in and kind of contribute to
the to our metaverse
uh yeah if you if you buy a uh if you
buy the freelance passport you
contribute to building a freelance
metaverse and all of those metaphors
that will be connected to freeland
because the the core idea of freelance
is that anyone can build their his own
world and the passport must
give the
users their own possibility to to vote
to and uh make a
rules uh
between each other and this is why we
also try to uh we will work with another
uh startup that uh called your justice
they trying to build also a thing with
um
liber land but this is a actually a
social network where everyone can build
their own jurisdiction and this is uh
something that we can implement into the
passport and then
implement onto
onto metaverses and try to make mvps of
a new society
very cool very cool thank you
yeah welcome absolutely ivan question
yeah a few questions uh the first is uh
how much of your real body is in the
field of view of your camera because we
see that you're like uh may make some
gestures with your hands uh so does it
mean that you have your all your body
and field of view in the camera
actually no i'm not that rich to buy uh
accents accents it's uh it's a full body
tracker that's
that costs uh
three or four thousand dollars uh i
don't have enough money for that but i
got enough money to buy uh
an iphone uh x like uh with a
face tracking uh to for to to be able to
use
the ir kit and a
hand tracker call it motion lip that i
bought for a
hundred dollars and i just connected all
this stuff into the animes and then uh
this is uh this is how i can move my
body
okay so you're connecting your device to
some existing software uh
right
yep
yeah great
just just yeah just wondering how how
did you make this gestures and then you
connect this all to obs so that it uh
displayed on your avatar right
yeah i just uh i connected uh
animes and uh it's it's
[Music]
just sending data into obs and uh this
is how i can uh
this is not the perfect tracker because
like as you can see uh when i i try to
to move my arms out of a range of my
tracker
hands are just
stretching up
and doing weird stuff
so yeah
yeah that's it and also you're sharing
your screen this is so made by obs so
you don't really need to request to
share your screen right
yeah
yeah the second question is is much like
about pro project about technological
side uh you mentioned apf ipfs and
i i didn't really dive into the
technology but i heard that it's not
really stable it needs like you to
maintain some node which will keep all
of your data and if you disable this
node all this data
there is some risk that all this data
will be lost unless someone is like
requesting it over and over again so
it's like a torrent
like
if you remove your seed node like uh
your
your data is
not not available anymore right
yes this is because and this is why
there is other solution like pinata
this is a solution for a pfas to pin uh
different kind of data and
i forgot how it called uh i already
talked about that with
one of the developers from amana and uh
he said that just i'll try to to
to sh
to watch what he
uh responds to me and this is horrell um
so yeah i talked with him about that and
he said yeah nft storage they they pin
data through uh
through a nifty storage and if you
if you go there you can see how it works
and uh
yeah this is this is just another couple
of code
on top of epfs
i i don't i can't say much about the
technical uh
aspect of that because i'm a
much more uh like a designer uh yeah
yeah
and maybe maybe you know how much it
costs to for example to store one
megabyte like for
some
[Music]
it must be free i know that
in pinata
there is a pricing tags
uh but there is a
freemium version and
yeah you just
you
yeah i can't say much more about that
just
all i know is that it's
all this stuff is done by protocol labs
and um
this is uh
if you want to know more you just
you just kind of go to here there uh
git and uh watch
how it's done okay okay okay got it i
just trying to
like find the some some points on how
can we with our technology with our
like plans to create like forever
storage called like uh drive
chain if i'm not mistaken how how can we
jump in uh to whatever stuff with that
because it seems to me the drive chain
can be a forever
the
uh storage for all of the metaverse
combat
yeah this is uh for me i guess this is a
good question and this is why uh there
is uh
there was some issues with a
synchronization between avatars uh in uh
mana versus but uh
for now it
kind of works so you you
you can you can host your own metaverse
and
call your uh your friends so to talk
with them
in it and
sometimes uh
synchronization of a voice and uh
placement of avatars is isn't really um
accurate but it works so yeah i can't
say much more about that but i i hope
we will uh
to just uh
fix all issues that are actually uh
here
thank you very much
you're welcome thank you uh we have a
question from ben
ben please yeah just uh two quick
questions for you but a uh first one is
all this uh compatible with vr did i see
on there
uh yeah it will actually it's uh
compatible only with a desktop uh
browser uh the second
the second step will be uh mobile
devices because uh much more people have
a mobile there rather that uh via vr
headset but yeah hey they it's all they
they telling us that it will be done but
first first thing first
yeah of course of course and second
question for you uh can you do the
macarena for us with your avatar
he depends is uh
he doesn't really uh
uh nicely synchronized with my head but
i hope
in
in the future i will uh
try to dance
the in the most accurate wave
again okay
challenge accepted then awesome thanks
buddy great stuff thank you very much
uh darkwing go ahead
uh yep just a quick question amazing
presentation i just wanna ask
does the engine of this project uh have
some sdk or methods or
the ability to integrate for example
ballots i mean
payment in errors or something like this
buying canals and
so on
uh at this time uh you got the
documentation of how we build on uh on
on this uh the docs uh dot mona dot
gallery uh but uh forever
this is why i called
grand bazaar to
uh to
to to reach
mona's developers to
to develop
this
this possibility but at this time all we
can do is that i already implemented
that in the for three months gallery if
we go to
to the center
right here
so i can just take
uh so if i click on the mf coin i will
uh
uh i will run to the flat tube and this
is where i can exchange my ever
and
for now it works it works like that but
i i hope in the near future we will be
able to exchange
directly into metaverse between uh users
uh okay great yes i mean maybe uh is
there some documentation to develop some
plugins
yes
for now you have a two sort of
documentation is the documentation of
mona uh right there
you don't see it
sorry my my screen is uh
i i i opened i opened
up ah this yeah sorry this is just my
screen is uh
changing without my permission uh so
yeah there is documentation right uh
where is
uh
i
so when you when you go to mona you can
click uh this way build a space and this
is where uh they they talk about how to
how to use their own template so there
is a template of unity you just download
it and try to to make your own stuff
inside or if you want to make exchanges
directly between users i think it's most
interesting to
reach ready player me
and
try to talk with them on discord and
they have a documentation
about
uh support here
this is
i i don't remember where it is but they
have a documentation
uh ducks yeah this way unic area so
there is all uh
all documentation that you can see
it works with a unity and in real and i
guess if you
if you ask them you can
you can find how to implement maybe the
uh ever scale wallet uh into the
avatar uh interface
okay yep maybe there can be some gs
scripts for unity
in to and integrate them in your unity
um
new world and then maybe we can
call them
from your space yep thank you
you're welcome
adar thank you so much for that
presentation i think we're all very very
impressed and i think there's a lot that
can be done with it so listen
that was fantastic absolutely fantastic
thank you for having me
our pleasure
okay uh let's uh go to our next
presentation so uh we actually have um
two
new everscale startup competition with
uh winners with us we had two last week
uh we're probably gonna have a couple
next week as well
uh but the two that we have today with
us is uh piggy fi
and also demeter gift so we'll start
with piggy five by the way i absolutely
love this thing every time i every time
i say it it just brings a smile to my
face
um so i'm gonna read exactly what piggy
fight does um
so
um it allows people in africa to borrow
stable coins at zero interest and at
very low at a very low collateralization
ratio so here with us is uh
and forgive me if i mispronounce your
name is it olawafemi is that correct
follow femi
oh hi hello um
okay
i want your hand
right so we we have our family and we
have uh joseph emmanuel um gentlemen
welcome whoever wants to start first
please go ahead
so um oluwafemi is not yet at the moment
they will join us we proceed um but
there is paul alademiji on the call so
he would really want to start the
presentation
by all means please go ahead
all right grace uh thanks for having us
ron and the rest of the team
uh so i'll just go ahead to share my
screen
uh where i go through um some
uh
like where i go through basically what
pdf is and
what we're building and what problems
we're solving
so um just to clarify can you all see my
screen
yes we're here
okay awesome awesome all right so um
what is piggy five
basically piggy fi um is an application
on a platform that solves money problems
for africans so uh what are these money
problems we're talking about
so first of all sending money within
africa is very difficult uh most of the
uh current alternatives which are the
incumbents like swift western union and
monogram they're very slow and they take
a long time for you to get your value
and they cost a lot of money and require
a lot of documentation uh a lot of the
newer platforms are heavily linked to
banks so as a result you know maybe if
you want to send money to different
african countries you can only send
within maybe
nigeria to ghana or a total of about
four or five countries and then um
because of this a lot of africans have
resorted to you know sending money using
peer-to-peer channels but most of these
peer-to-peer channels have been very
informal and offline so that means they
go meet you know a
money exchange dealer on the street and
then they hand them their currency and
then that dealer facilitates the
exchange to a different country so the
problem with this is that it's very uh
it's it's it's very uh it's prone to
fraud
and then because you're dealing with
someone who you don't know at all
there's a lot of security risks involved
and it also takes a very long time the
second problem that piggy fi is solving
relates to saving money within africa so
in africa as
i don't know if you guys are aware but
we have some of the highest inflation
and evaluation rates in the world uh as
you can see in the chat below you can
see that and nigeria zimbabwe and a few
other countries have inflation rates as
high as 17 percent uh zimbabwe as you
can see has 107
so as a result of this a lot of people
don't like saving in their local
currencies they prefer saving in a
foreign currency but there's very few
applications that allow people uh solve
these problems so what piggyfire has
done is that we've built
a convenient way for people to be able
to save and send money within africa
i'm just a brief about our solution so
what we do is that we use the blockchain
uh to enable first of all easy and
automated
peer-to-peer transfers within and
outside africa secondly saving in u.s
dollars to protect against inflation and
defamation as i explained and then
thirdly the infrastructure that we're
using to enable this we're going to be
releasing it as a suite of api and
developer tools for businesses and other
people who want to enable you know
crypto exchange or crypto to fiat
exchange to be able to use it to um
apply it within their websites
applications and other uh platforms
um some of people need bigify as we
showed here like there's a lot of
use cases where piggy fi can be used and
all over africa a lot of people ask for
these things we actually you know uh
went across twitter and then found a lot
of people asking
about you know sending money uh being
able to you know access money in
different countries
but i don't want to waste time with that
so i'll just take you through some of
the features of pdfi as well as our
architecture so uh pigify has a
peer-to-peer currency conversion for one
uh apart from that also we also allow
you save money your local currency which
is us dollar by facilitating it using uh
cryptocurrencies such as cusd cellular
dollar and busd uh
binance usd um then apart from that as
well you can also send money and receive
money across africa from even outside
africa to within africa then apart from
this uh as i mentioned earlier we're
going to be releasing
our api as a suite of developer tools
so let me quickly explain uh the
technology and how that peer-to-peer
system works uh it's a bit complicated
but i'll just try to simplify it and i'm
sure everyone will be able to understand
so in the center of everything basically
is a global p2p api so what this p2p api
does is that it enables uh people who
want to exchange money to be able to
access these fonts through vendors so
vendors are individuals or businesses
who provide liquidity to the platform
and liquidity in this sense is um cello
dollar or busd so in an instance where
someone in america let's say user a
wants to send money to user b which is
me in nigeria what user it does is that
he funds his piggyfi wallet with um
uh usd for example since he's in the
united states of america and then piggy
fi smart contracts then matches of the
piggy fi api matches that
user with a vendor who has busd and then
that vendor after receiving the funds
that is the hundred dollars that user a
wants to send
that vendor's liquidity which is locked
on the p2p api platform is then
subtracted from
using rpd5 smart contracts and then
after it is subtracted the value that uh
the uh vendor uh
the value that was subtracted from the
vendor's amount which is hundred dollars
is then reflected in user b's account so
this means that user a um uh the vendor
who had provided liquidity on the
platform
out of the liquidity that the vendor had
provided would be taking say hundred c
usc from that liquidity and then
provided it to user b so on user base
and after he has received the funds by
the time he wants to exchange it for his
local currency which is naira he also
looks for a different vendor who
provides this time around naira to busd
exchange and then this vendor is able to
you know we subtract the amount from
that vendor and then provide the higher
equivalent to the user b in nigeria um
don't worry by the time we're explaining
the demo uh when we're giving the app
demo you'll be able to understand it if
it's better but basically we are using
our liquidity providers to be able to
provide you know end-to-end exchange of
currencies from one particular country
to the other
um i'm going to briefly go through the
market and then
also some of the current competition
in this space uh so the market size
basically we have um 14 billion dollars
in uh intra-african remittances as well
as there's a huge number of mobile money
users in africa
uh then some of the current competition
of course as i mentioned earlier uh we
have the uh informal p2p channels that a
lot of people use this includes um some
of the burrito changes and a system
called the hawala system so the problem
of this is that it is prone to fraud as
i said earlier and then a lot of it is
also very manual and is used for money
laundering then other systems such as uh
western union and uh
swift wire transfers are very slow and
uh they actually cost a lot of money
some of the modern fintechs have tried
to use crypto to solve this problem but
a lot of them still rely heavily on
banks while we rely on our p2p system
and this p2p system gives us certain
advantages such as being easier to scale
and also being censorship proof so
because it's the decentralized system uh
you know the government or banks or
other regulatory bodies can't easily
shut it down because they would have to
you know rely on the white so
before they can shut it down they'll
have to shut down you know multiple
nodes or multiple p2p uh accounts which
will prove to be very difficult then
apart from this also we're also lowering
the entry barrier to crypto because
people who use piggyfi won't need to
connect their wallets except for the
liquidity providers if i want to send
money to my brother in kenya i don't
need to know how to use crypto at all
um our revenue model basically we're
going to be charging on transfers and
savings as well as the api itself and
then we have a very very comprehensive
go to market strategy that involves um
social media marketing email marketing
and also acquiring vendors through
offline uh channels which includes
direct contacts and partnerships with
telegram groups where there's a lot of
as i said earlier this
p2p exchange happens informally in very
many channels offline so what we're
doing is that we're putting this onto
the blockchain and we're going to be
taking some of those vendors who
currently operate in telegram groups and
offline channels and we're going to be
putting them online through pd5
um
some of our milestones uh we developed
the initial proof of concept last year
and we've set up a core team and we've
won several hackathons uh with this idea
including zen hackathon we currently
have a partnership with zend which is a
yield aggregator uh for defies in
nigeria or in all over africa then uh
apart from this we also won harmony
hackathon as well as the african
different prizes of cello uh for this
quarter one we're currently developing
the alpha version of the pdf platform as
well as the global
peer-to-peer api which is going to be
released in quarter one uh latest by the
end of april we should have something up
and running and during that time we're
going to be supporting our currency
conversions between naira and the usd as
well as remittances into nigeria
uh then in the future we're going to be
branching out into other african
countries as well
our team consists of
as i mentioned earlier femi who i think
is with us right now then aloha femi is
basically the uh blockchain developer he
has years of experience in blockchain
development and uh
he before he joined uh pdf before he
started pd5 uh uluwa femi was the
founder of a
fintech startup which processed over 500
000 dollars in customer savings and had
more than 20 000 users
joseph emmanuel is a full stack
developer uh bosses me manube is our
ui designer i called meiji i'm a product
manager who
helps with uh basically managing the
whole project building up the community
and trying to get our alpha to at least
a v1
so um up next i'm going to get emmanuel
who is a full stack developer to give a
brief demo of the pdf application so you
can see how it actually works
for the user
absolutely thank you thank you paul
emmanuel
yeah hello me
yes yes we can hello okay i can't seem
to share my screen right i think i'm
disabled oh uh just uh paul can you stop
sharing
all right
i think you can now
[Music]
facing my screen
uh no not yet
oh there it is yes now i can yep
okay um
uh
one second
i'm trying to navigate
okay yeah um so
this is the
um version one for the piggyfi platform
um what we have here is what the
customers or clients will see when they
log into their piggify app and you can
see um the person can basically decide
to phone your wallet and what that means
is that like um depending on the country
the person is they might not have u.s
dollars so that's why we are
relying on like
um
cryptocurrencies like cusd stable
currencies like cusc to like um make
that happen so when they click on phone
volume what happens is they pick the
amount they want to phone say 2000 error
when they proceed to the next page
they can like it tells them oh you're
about to fund your order with five
thousand or five thousand is like the
local currency for nigeria and um if you
tell them the equivalent and usd that's
about
878 usd
um you
click on confirm so what this is is um
it's showing them
that they are about to like connect to a
vendor so the system will automatically
connect them to like a vendor that can
satisfy their order and the vendor is
supposed to like provide them with the
um dollar equivalent of that amount they
are trying to fund so if i'm saying if i
want to fund my wallet with 5000 error
the vendor is going to provide me with
like um eight usd to my wallet so when
they click proceed um it waits and i can
transfer so it shows me the account to
transfer
the money to locally so i can transfer
basically the factor on to the vendor
locally
and once that is done
it takes me back to like my dashboard
where my funding my account has already
been funded and with that i can
basically fund my savings
you can pick um what
how long you want to save the lock the
phone with us for
and
how much you want to lock with us so
what happens is on the back end when you
click proceed it
then locks the phone for like as long as
you want it to be locked for and you get
like roi you get like interest rates
based on that duration and settings that
we've provided
um i believe this is supposed to be like
a quick brief demo so i'll stop here and
wait for questions
i'm sorry yeah yeah you're ready oh okay
yeah um
that's it you're ready for questions
yeah yeah
um okay um
i have one
um i think i may and forgive me i'm not
a technical person or maybe i
i'm trying to sort of understand
wherever scale fits into this
do you want to take the question
hello anyone
yeah
i i guess i'm trying to understand
it's a fantastic presentation a great
idea and um it would benefit
the african community greatly
i guess i'm maybe it's just me i'm i'm
kind of uh lost as to where ever scale
or
formerly free time fits into this
hi can everyone hear me yes hi okay i
was muted i wanted to speak
yes go ahead
okay all right so um the way do we add
global b2b
um works is that um
we support like different blockchain
like currently now we only support like
cello and um busting right in order to
provide liquidity we can provide
liquidity in any any stable currency
um irrespective of the blockchain right
so right now we will integrate cellul
and
and um venus finance matching which we
might be using right so forever scale
that's the same thing we are going to do
so the idea of the global ptp is like to
power liquidity like
um across africa to accept americans so
we we are more concerned about like you
know
what are blockchain that we are going to
integrate
the the cost of transaction and
the speed
in order to like um perform the
transactions also important so for any
because for youtube api we're going to
be offering it to of that blockchain
startup that needs to provide liquidity
for your customer right so for any
blockchain startup that wants to build
whatever skill and
one of the reason why i'm not sure if
paul like expansion on that vehicle that
we are doing the global hdb platform is
because in africa what realizes one of
the biggest barriers to engine
for blockchain is because um quite a
number of people are struggling with the
concept of understanding using metamasks
trustworthiness gas fees and all of
those things right so one of the
advantage of the private api that we are
building is that if a blockchain startup
wants to build today and they want to
accept like any token on ever skill as
um as a form of payments what our global
p2p api can do is they can directly
convert their fiat to that token you
know stable currency or any like talking
on that blockchain without having to go
through the
metamax um
trust wallets understanding of gas flow
right so that that is how ever skill
fits into this project
okay so so basically you're just using
the platform as a as a as a back end
i don't get a question for you
you're using it as a backend because
basically it's just a fast blockchain
where you can make the transaction go by
a lot quicker is have you already
implemented the
uh uh ever in your
project
not yet because we are not done
with um building the
uh p2p blockchain api once we are done
in order to add like a different um
blockchain is like going to like easy
just to deploy the smart contract on the
blockchain
okay understood
all right thank you very much uh
do you have anyone just
um just to just to mention as well um
one of the reasons we're also looking to
integrate other blockchains including
everscale is that um because this api is
being released to several companies
there might be other uh maybe partners
of everscale who are looking to you know
integrate payments within africa and as
a result of this um instead of them
having to build their system into and
they can actually plug into uh piggy
fry's api and then with this uh p2p api
they can accept payments um easily
within africa so it's um your
your partnerships with other companies
can actually be uh much more effective
you know within africa for payments
rather than
having to start from scratch
um and they would be so so be a conduit
like uh but essentially it would be
because what we're doing is we're
transferring money right uh through the
blockchain
so if somebody owns evers ultimately
what they are going to want to do is
they're going to want to convert them
into some sort of fiat currency correct
exactly
so
um
okay all right thank you i understand
thank you very much uh does anybody have
any more questions
thank you very much uh
please uh is it aloha for me is that
right
oh yeah yeah yes okay i i was i was so
nervous about pronouncing your names
alawafami uh
emmanuel joseph thank you very much uh
everybody great presentation i
appreciate it
uh let's see let's go to we have another
competition order it's a demeter gift um
demeter gift um and i'm gonna i'm gonna
quote this is a fun and transparent
auction for nfts that focus on charities
which is
nothing's better than charity excellent
so
we have steve tyson with us
hi steve pleasure to have you it's all
yours take take the mic
can you see my screen
yes we can
great
[Music]
so hello everybody uh my name is steve
um i'm one of uh
the people in the the media gift team um
the media gift is a gift with a story
and when we did some research we found
that charities are very important in our
society they are the organizations that
help
uh things going on they help like people
that for example have like very
a lot of difficulties but also very
important research
and what we
found in our research also with
charities for example in south africa
for hiv
they said that because of kobe 19 it's
pretty difficult to really collect money
in in the right way and also to make it
more fun
so that's also the reason why we started
our research we found like a couple
problems and four major problems says
that the process of the donations is not
always very transparent it's very
difficult to
uh
make like a payment infrastructure and
donations
create a lot of administration and one
of the last thing is that because of
over 19 at that time it was very
difficult also to start like events like
charity auctions events to also to
engage
your uh your donators and that's the
reason why we started the media gifts
and the immediate uses the the power of
the blockchain infrastructure to create
the most easy transparent and fun nsa uh
charity auction on web3 because our
thing is that we want to go uh to engage
the donators but also make them more fun
and also create events for charities on
their own platform
so a little bit in a nutshell our
protocols that donate as they can make a
wallet so
they can connect their wallet under the
media gifts so we already collect
connecting already
a couple wallets one of those also like
every skill what you can do is that
people can donate nf days uh to the
charities and people they can bid on it
and that means that the highest bid that
money will go directly to the charity so
the great thing about this is that you
have a better peer-to-peer
system
in a more fun way and this money can go
to the charity wall wallet directly
so there's not a lot of
organizations in between
and this
gives us a more transparent way because
we also know that for example like
governments but also pharmaceutical
companies sometimes they double
the the donates the donations and this
is most of them also like a tax-free
donation so that's also very interesting
if you can make it more transparent for
the governments
and when you uh want to buy as a charity
for example like equipment you can also
show to your donators where you have to
spend where you spend the money into it
because you can directly buy the
equipment for example also with our
protocol
so the next thing is that uh what we
want to do is that with uh the nfk by
donation so if you donate a special nfc
you also can bid on us and we also make
our own nfcs for example for the hiv um
so you can also see a couple of them
here
so amazing things here um donations is a
it's a big thing and we also started
like in the past that's very powerful
people that also donate a big big amount
but we also see for example like events
like elton john that uh
yeah create like all events to also to
collect money
and what we want to do in um the media
gifts is that we also making like an api
that can be plugged in in like for
example like social media accounts so
that means that when you go
to that
to that event you can donate directly
and then goes to that charity event for
example like the auction event which is
very very interesting
and
maybe one thing in this time now is that
we also see that we really want to help
people directly so you also see for
example like in the
the big thing and this time
that we really want to support do
support people in ukraine and we also
saw that for example like 60 61 000
people
also uh booked like an airbnb stage to
help these people directly and on the
other way we also see that there's a lot
of scammers behind here that people they
yeah want to scam people
um
about the thing which is really really
bad so when we can make this more like
accessible but also more in a secure way
we can help people directly and it also
can help to protect a lot of people in
this kind of way
so the next thing is that also we make a
more accessible for example to also join
children into there be because maybe
they don't have money but so cool is
that if you can make your own nsa for
example like an art or a song you can
upload it in our platform and people can
bid on it you are then a part of the
whole ecosystem without spending any
penny
and
what we are doing here is that we
creating the bridge between the four uh
171 billion dollar charities for
something in the u.s in combination with
already a full 40 billion market about
nf days and we are bridging these two
major things in a fun and more
accessible way for charities
so what we can do we can help the
donators to make it transparent
destination everywhere at any time also
involve processors we also can help
society by also creating like new
projects it's because it's very
very accessible for everyone to start
like a project and on the other way we
can help charities to give them like a
good payment infrastructure to start
very nice events and also get like money
directly and help them to invest in an
infrastructure
so
our benefits is that what what i said is
that also organizations and former they
can for example double the amount but
the more interesting thing here is also
that a lot of governments they have like
a tax-free donation and if you can show
with uh with our system that you have
done a donation you can show directly
to the to the to the text organization
that you have done this donation so how
cool is it if you can do directly your
text free donation
so we have like a part of it so we also
working now on several grants and the
great thing is that also we help already
we already in in in contact with
organizations that maybe can use our
platform and behind everyone uh several
big awards uh and we also are occurring
in some
accelerators here to also to help and to
scale our projects which is really
really interesting
so a part of our demo um this is our
video where we explain a little bit
about how the media gear is going we
also changing our design so this is the
old design but the new design is already
live
at first we go to the website
demetergive.com
when you're on the homepage you can
connect your ever wallets
if you don't have an account you can
easily create an account to connect
when you're giving the permission
it will connect and show automatically
your funds overview
when you went to create an auction event
as a charity
you created events by giving the title
end dates
ever wallet address
amount goal
and the logo link
also there is an extra option to
generate a plugin
after creating the event the event will
be shown on the auction event page where
you can see all the events from the
charities because you have selected the
generating plugin you will automatically
get an html file as a plugin using this
html file the organizer can set up the
event on their own website
where users can donate nfds or crypto
punks and bid on it
for each auction event you can donate
nfds
crypto bugs or bids on one of the nfts
on the auction event page
so
when we donate an nft
we have to fill in all the fields
when this is done the smart contract is
created
this means that the nft is donated to
the charity auction event
the great thing is that because of the
plugin
all the donations and bits can be shown
directly on a website from the charity
for bidding you can only place a bid if
it's higher than the current bid
so when you pick it
it'll make connection with the ever
wallet
[Music]
when the bit is higher than the current
bid your bid will be accepted and shown
on the page
[Music]
because we are a big fan of crypto bunk
we created a special way to donate
crypto funds directly to the charity
auction event
which works the same way as donating
another nft
[Music]
when the event is finished
and you have placed the highest bids the
smart country will then be executed
automatically
so this means that the charity receives
the amount and you the wonderful nfc
[Music]
besides that
you can easily pair
[Music]
and swap tokens
would you like
yeah so here you can see a little bit
how we integrate it and um what's what i
also want to
say is that because of our plugin we
also can help a charity organization to
directly start an event on their own
website because of our plugin and at the
moment we are with five people crossover
the netherlands germany and bangladesh
and my background is also that i haven't
started in uh healthcare where we also
raised over five hundred thousand in
non-diluted funding with grants
and we also see that this can be have
like a huge opportunity especially in
this uh in this time so well thank you
for your time
sorry couldn't unmute my foot thank you
very much steve that's very interesting
um
i i um i have a question i have a couple
um so i i it's kind of like a
it's kind of like a change.org with
something that's actually actionable
not just
not just baloney
where people just sign stuff and it
doesn't mean anything but here you can
actually donate something but i do have
this question so uh so if i do so i can
create an nft i donate that nft to a
charity of my choice could that
possibly be construed as a security
uh
what sense
in that it's an nft but what i'm really
doing is i'm making a donation right um
now the charity aspect of it might um
negate the security aspect of it but uh
the or the securities aspect of it but
here really it is we're talking about
like anybody looking at it from uh
regulatory point of view might look at
it and say okay well they're donating
money right yeah so what would be like
do you know how
have you researched the legislation
behind something like that um
how how a regulatory body would look at
it yeah i think that's a good question
but i think that's like for all the
blockchain projects for example in the
netherlands they close a lot of
change but if we see for example in
wyoming in the us they're also changing
the regulatory laws and there so i think
we are like in an industry that is
changing really really rapidly of sort
of context there but i think it's a good
question i think the most important
thing is that we know that for example a
lot of donations are now are not
transable so we don't know for example
where the money is going through so i
think this is a big big adventures and i
for example also like in politics where
a lot of people want to support their
own parish so
if you can make them more transparent um
is to make it more accessible for
everyone if you don't have money you can
donate your own nfc
for example with your creativity
[Music]
something with a lot of things in there
but we also know that chicken in the egg
all the time
yeah and maybe even uh yeah and because
it could potentially any nft could
potentially rise in value
so okay you answered my question yeah
absolutely
does anybody else have questions for
steve
ben
hey steve uh yeah really really great
product buddy um i really like it uh a
very simple question do you have a
website at all am i missing it i was
just googling but um
i didn't find that either i didn't find
one either
demeter is the it's a uh an old goddess
yeah yeah yeah
yeah it's it's a demeter gift i believe
it's demeter
it's the mediagive.com and actually we
also bought the new domain name the
mediagivescoin.com
because we are also looking in to start
our own coin in 2024 something which we
are now in association with a lot of
parties that are helping us with good
advice but uh the website is the
mediagift.com
well you can do that on everscale now
you can see you can do that right now
i have to say that the mediagive.com is
uh now some wallets are accessible but
uh we have to say we we did some pilots
so every skill was a pilot but we also
did some uh pilots with auto wallets and
what you're doing now in the coming
months is to integrate all these wallets
together
yeah
so it's like upping and running all the
time
understood
yeah and you said you were working with
a couple of um groups like uh crypto
chicks was it yeah exactly so we also
like uh get approval to to go in the
crypto checks accelerator which is
really cool because we think also we
need more women in uh in the technology
and for example like we have more fifty
percent of our team is women uh it's a
friendly issue fashion you cannot join
today but uh yeah so we also go in in
that part
thank you very much steve thank you very
much
does anybody have any more questions for
steve
all right all right before we get to
youtube questions we're going to go
right to our final segment um all right
i got it i have like always been i got
to read it okay so it's uh from
marklings yeah
uh our bombastic british bullhorn ever
scales uk brother like no other none
other than ben himself smack us upside
the head with your bits buddy
that's a very visual image and put your
hand down
and put your hand down by the way
it's more fun smacking you upside the
head with my bits while i've got my
hands up yeah yeah yeah it's a bit
long-winded there right bits for you
guys uh right so straight into it there
have been a few uh cool updates on surf
this week uh one of which i really liked
which i tested out yesterday uh you can
now kind of basically buy directly get
uh gift cards for over 5 000 different
vendors through surf with your ever and
uh again there's kind of uh some of
those issues ron was touching on it it
kind of it's a nice way to keep the ever
in the ecosystem whilst also keep it
flowing and i think it's a really good
initiative um obviously they're in beta
phase at the minute but do test it out
uh there was an announcement on the news
channel yesterday and it's very cool way
to save up for some christmas presents
as well i think that that might be what
i've been looking at it for
uh
next up we also had uh one of the d5
alliance members was interviewed in
forbes or had a couple of comments in
there no less so that's definitely some
really good publicity there guys well
done on that
uh the indian sub-governance the
community voice sub-governance and a
couple of the other uh sub-governances
which are kind of winding down
activities have uh returned some of the
uh funds they had remaining to the giver
account over the past couple of days
which is a really good thing obviously
so uh you know kind of out with the old
in with the new moving on with the
initiatives
uh speaking of new initiatives i i
really like this one uh scouting grants
so uh
uh basically if you've seen the
everscale grants program
well you might think oh damn i don't
have a startup myself but i do know
someone who does well now you can get
paid just for kind of introducing them
you know you do that little golden
handshake thing and there's there's you
know an incentive available for you so
what you're waiting for brilliant
and last but not least on my list of
course i was going to read a little
something but i might actually just
share a quick little clip i managed to
find one clip from this week's never
mind the coins which i don't think
is x-rated at all so
share sound and here we go can i get a
little thumbs up or something can we all
see that
yep
yep aces and hopefully we'll be able to
hear it as well give him my track record
though we'll wait and see that's such a
good idea though that old dvd thing
where you watch it and then you're like
just touch the corner just touch the
corner i'm waiting it's been five
minutes you're still here
you're betting on which corner it's
going to be yeah
there we go so yeah it was a lot of fun
that was the oh that was the only
g-rated part of it that was pretty much
out of 33 minutes of recording about the
only 20-second individualized joke i
could find which wasn't uh mentioning
something slightly inappropriate for a
lunchtime uh work or work meeting so but
yeah it was a lot of fun and we covered
so much news i realized like if you feel
like there was anything in kind of
february the first couple of days of
march that you missed in the crypto news
you know catch it up 33 minutes
a few jokes few laughs
um
going back to what steve said we had a
good uh crypto chick representation with
amy and dion playing against eugene um
yeah who
didn't do too good of a job of
representing us sir that's been out
there but you know i'll let him off
because it's eugene and we love eugene
so yeah if you haven't left a review or
you know all that kind of stuff anything
you can do really helps and yeah thank
you everyone that's my bits for this
week thank you ben thank you very much
uh roman has his hand raised vermont i
think he you did have a
quick thing that you wanted to tell
everybody right
uh
yeah exactly uh i just want to uh to
make a short announcement that we
launched the form
every scale community feedback form that
everyone can report
about bags
about the current problem in the
ecosystem
[Music]
you can suggest your marketing offer or
any help you want or you can find the
job or in the
companies in ecosystem uh just filled
this form uh
this announcement
was posted on the
on the everscale unused uh channel
and it will be uh reposted every single
week so
you're welcome to any your feedback
thanks
thank you ramon you heard him
all right uh well we have uh two
questions on youtube and uh technically
one of them's been answered but i'll
voice it just for the sake of this call
uh what about the freeland passport nftn
upper scale blockchain i believe that
was addressed uh very clearly by dadar
and the second is there are nfts on sale
uh
on grand bazaar is it possible to have
some more information i don't believe we
have anybody on the call from grand
bazaar here but i guarantee that they
will uh watch this video and they will
respond if you
need you can dm me directly and i'll
write uh here
at uh yoast
three
just dm me and i'll get you in touch
with the right people so
so that's it
any more questions any more comments
just just a question to roman d about an
issue i'm still block it on to
the russian everscale community just
because i tried to share links to the
for freelance
so happened to me too yeah just just uh
pm me uh in the chat and i'll unblock
you because there are a lot of spammers
unfortunately
okay okay it's happened to me too even
