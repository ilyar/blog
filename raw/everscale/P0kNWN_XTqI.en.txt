cheers
hi alex
is pablo going to join
oh your audio is very low
oh wait hello hello hello hello
hello
hi everybody
alrighty
i think maybe eugene you might have to
mute
getting some weird feedback
okay
so good day to everybody i hope you're
all enjoying the summer and uh
kind of a modest appreciation of the
market over the past few days just a
little bit notably a bitcoin and of
course ever has been going up a bit
which is exciting so maybe we will not
have
a winter this winter
so
let's look at the agenda and i'm going
to hand it over to our own pavel mr pvp
he's got some strategic updates to share
with us
so pavel if you're ready
yes
hi everyone
we had
i don't know
fifth uh strategic meeting now they're
called
strategic meetings not uh architectural
ones
uh last
thursday and we'll have it's this
thursday as well
so there was a presentation of
smft consensus how it works and
specification and code
very least
for actually they were open source
and now
uh
i mean different developers in our
system they can join testing and they
can
see
see how it works
uh this is the first
actually this is the first phase of uh
releasing of smft
consensus
so there will be more updates but i
think this is
probably most important at the moment
because
uh
it was underdeveloped for more than a
year and
it is a big
chunk of code to be honest
so the same story happened with ramp
it
also was
released in public so ramp
uh
ram software is
almost
uh ready for production i hope so
because it was interest for quite a
number of months
uh coming to network called rfld
uh
now validators they have plans to
launch
the
rfld network
with ram and do
community testing
so will be interesting to see how to
work because before that one leverage
made uh test for ramp
uh protocol
so those are two major
advances in in development and now they
are open for everyone
so now you see that everex
who was doing
stuff during that
year
not only
patching
not for
some minor updates but also was working
on
significant
updates which were
announced in white paper
what else um
also
probably long waited uh update for
multi-signature contract started last
week
actually the first version of new
multi-signature contact was released
if
you probably don't know
multi-signature contract was written
before even the launch of network
and this is a great contract i think
because as far as as now due to phone
modification there were no any problems
with it
but uh it was
now
since compiler
uh
got
30 updates
since that time
uh the code was which was written more
than two years
i don't know two and a half years ago it
is not compatible with the current
compiler so this is
just
uh just
in the input update there are some
additional
features will be added to
multi-signature contract
for example they will be protection from
replay
uh
we which means the message to much
signature
should include signature of the
addressee
so
they will not be possible to replay the
message for one contract
for another contact with exactly the
same custodians
which is again not the back of the
contract it's a logical uh
uh
logical issue which was not envisaged uh
when it was designed in first place
uh
yeah so that got it for the test
and hopefully
after some audits will be released in
couple of weeks
this is all folks for major updates we
had
oh great that's a lot of updates thank
you pawel
does anybody on the call have any
questions
anything they'd want to ask
just raise your hand i don't see
anything
okay maybe later on maybe from the
community we have a call
thanks pavel
so we're going to move on the agenda to
the new academy website so we have
eugene here joining us um he and the
academy crew have been working hard on
the academy website
and they've also added some interesting
features and he's here to share more
cool
hello hello can you see my name yes i
can
okay so this is a very brief update um
the academy website received a lot of
comments from people some positive some
wishing
for certain changes
and the main criticism of the website
was the difficulty we had with
rebranding it was very hard to
do something with more than 30 videos
that we have we had on the website uh
which mentioned freetom
and uh i have to admit we were unable to
clean it all up so uh just too time
consuming to complicate it so what we
did is we created the brand new website
at the moment and you see the address in
its chat
uh it is
nft.everscale.academy.explorer
and in fact this is a full-blown
marketplace uh nft marketplace what we
decided to do is to work with a very
different concept than before
uh we took uh only uh directly relevant
courses uh and added some new ones
particularly from government blockchain
association the standard course uh the
first module we already have that they
teach
and um we decided to simply uh
offer them for sale either through
direct sale or through auctions
and only the courses that deal directly
with blockchain
so at the moment what you see is an mvp
uh we have i believe um alex here on the
call who was a major contributor
to this and essentially
we are a standalone platform platform
right now
so um we will be working to improve uh
this in the near future uh by adding
courses by adding functionality
but essentially uh the mechanism has
changed uh there's no uh mention a
single dimension of freetown anywhere uh
addressing the comments that we received
and we
expect and just to remind everyone uh
the academy is
one of the oldest existing english
speaking groups
in our community
it has not missed a single weekly
meeting since it started
yes we worked there every wednesday
at 11 a.m new york time
and the audience of academy is very
broad today it includes people from
about 11 countries
so uh we encourage of course people come
take a look at mvp provide us with
further comments
and we will be back when the site is
fully functional um at the moment uh
we're working on essentially the
initiatives of the members there's no
community support
uh we found whatever activities uh i
needed ourselves at this time
and uh
we hope uh for the foundation support at
some point in the future alex i don't
know if you wanted to add something
briefly to what i said yes
i can add something uh
so
as you know
me is a part of the academy and
team of developers have an experience
especially in nft
we are currently developing
a little number of projects
in nft fair
and yes uh after discussion with
academic members we have this wonderful
idea idea uh
by the way
uh
this website
is
this website doesn't use any
uh content management system it's fully
uh made with react and
typescript and so on
and we have yes we have this wonderful
idea that courses can be an nft and
users can pay for this nft
and buy access to the course
all the user can
uh mean
or users can enroll some courses and uh
then mean uh
certificates
uh as uh previously we have some core uh
which we can integrate with the academy
so we have done this now and now yes
when development process to
to finish
some updates according to academy
specific like uh certificates and so on
um that's why
yep
we are in progress
thank you i think i think that's all yes
and back to you joe
okay great uh yeah so rebranding yes
we're no stranger to rebranding and
that's
it's not an easy thing to do but
congrats to you guys on that the website
looks really cool um the idea for nft
courses is also
awesome so i'm uh wondering
do you have like a kind of a referral
program in place are you building
something like that are you going to do
something with royalties and maybe
people can earn points and redeem for
forever courses
yes
thank you yes
thank you for asking that let me start
alex on you
basically the in addition to doing a
brand new website the the academy now is
in the process of developing its
economics
which will be based on a number of
interesting concepts such as a
reputation of uh teachers such as the
reputation of students
um such as teamwork
and uh rewarding people for
bringing useful uh
members to the team and a number of
other initiatives uh that is yet to come
um including some very advanced concepts
that frankly we looked up
in some of the other
friendly partner
initiatives in the educational space
alex you wanted to add something
um
joe asked about as i understand your
asked about the reference system
i guess we will think about this too
because we have
we have already uh as you know uh have
an experience with uh creating a
referral system for marketplaces
and maybe we will take this idea and
rebuild it according to academy model
data and so on but
yes we can do it for sure because we
have already did it
but
how will we do this for academy maybe it
will be referral system only for
teachers maybe on the for students i
think that we will discuss uh later
yes thank you
okay great
well that's very interesting and
definitely look forward to that when you
guys can share more information there um
and looking forward to when the website
is also
functional
that's cool too
yep we'll be back to report on that yeah
great
okay so
next up on the agenda is the everscale
white paper of deutsche
so we have a familiar face in the
community who spent a good chunk of her
time translating the entirety of the
everscale whitepaper into german so
here it's like vilcomen marin
if you're here
hello everyone can you hear me hi yeah
hi
hi so my name is maharan berlinga thank
you for letting me speak today i feel
very honored a little bit about myself
i'm german born and started working as a
high fashion model back in 2016.
since then i worked and lived in 11
different countries during my travels i
learned way more than i could ever learn
in any school i worked for social media
company and studied economics and
physics
the first time blockchain caught my
attention was back in 2014
when my former classmates
brought it up
and
discussed the topic of bitcoin and its
use in gaming industry since then my
interest in bitcoin grew and eventually
i became an investor myself and started
trading
and i have to mention thanks to bitcoin
covered 19 pandemic and its lockdown
weren't that bad however due to two
years in lockdown and it's many
economical and
social social consequences i decided to
leave europe and settled on mexico
since blockchain saved my life once
already i
as a resource of income i decided to
dedicate
more of my time to it not long after
arriving in tulum a local crypto club
caught my attention and this beautiful
life can be it happened eugene morozov
was a speaker that day it didn't took
long to figure he was the most competent
speaker that day and it turned out to be
true as well
um so that's also how my story with
everscale began we exchanged context and
i became a student and one of my first
tasks was of course to read every scale
white paper and since i'm a native
german speaker i naturally translated
technical language to make sure i
understand it myself
so while i was at it why not translate
it all
so then i also learned quickly meteor
approach differs a lot from any other
white paper i've read before
among many concepts that caught my
attention was web free
and the impact it will have on our
economy
democracy and society
overall i was very impressed by the
technology media described and its
implementation by your community that
built the network
on the translation itself
from a technical translation perspective
this work presented a few challenges
for example
i was confronted with many terms that
couldn't be translated to german easily
or not at all
i had to adapt and decided to keep
english originals or to conjugate them
when needed
additionally i decided not to translate
quotients to stay closer to the original
meaning and i'm convinced my german
fellows are well enough educated to
understand them
i had to change a few remaining mentions
of tom to ever except when mentioned in
historical context
during the whole process of a little
over four months i learned more and more
about every scale
network and figured there are little to
non-german speakers which surprised me
and has to be changed
so the concept of learning through white
paper translation changed and i decided
to use the translation to popularize
everscale technology among german
speakers which by some estimates are
around 150 to 7 170 million
next i intend to build the
german-speaking average scale community
starting in zurich switzerland where i
lived the past three years i plan to
bring in my classmate olynyon who is a
best-selling german author as a writer
and content creator
through my other personal connections i
plan to engage eso media my social media
experts and the quincy dash co has
public relation firms with clients like
forbes fox news bbc the times and many
more
another step is spreading the word
within my global social network which i
built over the six
last years including investors
celebrities manager managers agencies
and even social media companies
and the complete and to complete my
presentation i need your help to spread
the word
if you know any friends or colleagues
especially in the technology space who
are german speakers please send them the
link thank you for listening and i'm
ready for any questions you might have
fantastic that was lovely
does anybody have any questions for
martin
no well maybe later on but wow thank you
very much for your contribution um and
it's exciting to know that you're going
to be building a german community um
that's that was my remaining questions
after knowing that he had translated the
white paper you know can you send it to
your circles but in fact you're planning
on actually building more communities so
that's amazing thank you very much
um
so if there are any questions for you uh
i'll send them your way so please stick
around maybe there are some german
listeners and they want to reach out to
you
thank you
yeah thank you very much for joining
and i hope to see you around much more
