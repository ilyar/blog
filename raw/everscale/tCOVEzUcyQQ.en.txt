all right i think we can start
so welcome everyone to our 23rd weekly
defy call
of the free tone and we have
quite an agenda today so we have several
interesting topics to discuss
uh so let me just go briefly through the
agenda and then we will start so first
of all so
uh i would like to announce that we will
launch the ethereum bridge stage 2
contest so
somehow we forgot about this and
in fact we almost finished this
and presented this on the demo however
we need to still launch this contest
because the next stage is also
approaching where we will have
the governance models and economics
implemented
next topic is a doom swap contest with
fabrice today you're here with us so we
will discuss this as well
uh just a kind reminder on the polka dot
bridge stage 2 contest so now it's
voting time it's only 7 days left so
guys please don't
don't just miss this opportunity to
check and see what guys did and what
they submitted and
this time i hope uh it will also be fine
next we will shortly touch the external
jurors involvement
in the defy contest and uh finally
i would like to devote some time to
discuss back bounty programs uh
for all the technical solutions
developed within our sub-governance
so i will start with the first topic on
the agenda
which is a ethereum breach stage two so
uh just to remind so the second stage is
named
token transfer between two two
blockchains
and in fact it is a chained contest
meaning that only the
teams who has won any price place on the
first stage for
the implementation is eligible to
participate in the second stage so
actually this means that only brock's
team is
allowed to participate in this contest
so i think it's fine if we
make it with a short short term like one
month
i guess just to let us finalize all
the things and make it
polish it a bit as we
have shown during the demo last time
the bridge is now fully functioning of
course it is uh the for only the first
release and we
have got a lot of feedback from from you
guys and that's that's really cool
so we discussed internally and uh that
was really fine
uh the most criticism we've got is
uh that we still have some admin keys
just to update contracts in the
blockchain
uh we have slightly touches during the
demo but
um let me maybe uh clarify this a bit uh
deeper so to implement
governance model it will take three
something like three months
of of work of the team and
because it's not not that the easy the
easy task
and that's why currently we have of
course some
simpler architecture and it will go
it will go definitely and
after the governance model is ready it
will become
dually decentralized yeah like this term
in
in the free tone uh so meaning that
uh all the bridge contracts updates
uh from that moment will be controlled
only by the voting by the
relay network and
guys are approaching this task already
so i hope that they will be able to
start
in coming weeks so and now to
finalize the second stage so we formally
need to
to run the contests and uh and apply
this work
uh we also run a minor
bug bounty program so uh actually we
didn't expect
that much activity and uh i really
appreciate this and
we are still uh collecting the feedback
and just
grouping it so i just back a pattern
that we
didn't announce yet the results because
there's so much information
so i hope we will do this by end of this
week definitely so
nobody will will be forgotten i promise
uh next thing
that we would like to discuss today is a
dune swap so uh
fabrice uh shared with us the proposal
so uh for this maybe you just make some
intro
and describe a bit uh about the
partnership with dune
so uh what will be the outcome of this
contest
yes so indeed i am part of the june
community
uh in january we had a
vote on china in june
on return on the to to decide
that uh the two communities uh should be
merged
on the as part of the of this
of this proposal there would there was
the idea that there would be a contest
to develop a swapper
so that every dune token
would be converted to friton
crystal token so it's not really a swap
in the same sense as the bridge between
uh
ethereum and friton it's not about
having
june tokens on return but to convert
them
as a to dune to freeton tokens
so the the idea is to onboard
the dune community inside the freetown
community so of course
that has started already there are some
members that are already part of a few
sub-governances and they are also
involved in the in contests but to be
completely included
the the merger has to happen so i think
that now we
will really have to to to do that as
fast as possible
so what i did is i took a copy of the
ethereum bitcoin
bridge contest and i modified it
to to fit for a swap with juno
and so i submitted it on the forum also
and so the first questions i got was
about the bridge with tezos so
so june is a fork of tesos
but the technology especially the smart
contracts
are a bit different in the sense that
the language
for for dune is a
much more powerful than the one of tezos
so it's easier to write contracts
on june that than it is on tesos so i
think that
we shouldn't try to
to create immediately a bridge with
tezos in this contest
because it's i cannot estimate the time
it would take
and i can estimate the time it would
take for you know
which is a few weeks or something like
that
and and so i would prefer so it's my
opinion of course
to have two separated and the other
reason is that
to my knowledge there is not so much
defy
on tezos at this point they actually had
a bug
in the token wallet recently and they
had to
to to to clean it so
so i think it's not that urgent
to to have a blade with tezos so i think
the two contests could be separated and
the bridge with tasers can be done later
and especially as the people from june
have a better knowledge of this or they
will be able to also
compete in that contest so so i think it
makes sense to have the two separated
so that's for the introduction i don't
know if well
of course if you have questions i am
here today so i welcome any
questions and feedback on on the ideas
to
see how to to go forward now yeah thank
you so much
actually i have looked through a
proposal and i have few
few comments so um the first one
is uh normally we have
the contest split in several stages so
the first one is the design and
architecture stage
where we just collect
best architecture to implement this so
and
saying that this
kind of tool will not be that
that complex as a bridge one for example
as a fully functioning
bridge uh i think that the period
to implement this can can be really
shorter
and uh and i don't really know if we
need this
stage now uh taking that
according to the proposal that was taken
by the
main governance so the merger should
just end in under three months
so i don't know from which moment in
time the counter has started
uh so i cannot judge it
by myself if it's feasible or not so
maybe media
who's here uh can just give a comment on
this
so uh what do you think um
should we have some uh architecture
stage
at least even shorter one uh before we
run the
implementation i always prefer
architecture stage you know
yes yes so maybe what what we will do so
we
will uh run the architecture stage two
two weeks contest
just to collect some information because
uh
i bet there is no not so many experts in
tesla's
smart contracts here for now i hope that
the number will grow significantly after
the merger and uh
this case uh in this case uh fabrice i
invite you just to
deliver this information to tell us in
june development teams
who will be participating in this
contest and they will be writing the
implementation
so that they could come and participate
and the more participants is better
so uh actually uh and then we will uh
launch one month in the implementation
stage i think one month is more than
enough
for for this uh purpose uh and this
this way i think we will cope within the
time frame that was announced from the
main governance
the next uh point i will address
is uh that normally before launching the
contest so we preliminary
talk to to a number of teams uh
explaining
uh what is this contest about and
how it will be run uh what you need to
do to participate
just to ensure that at least several
teams will come and participate
and will you be able to do the same for
june
developers so i am not sure to
understand
who i should contact so clearly uh there
is a team of
origin labs that will be competing
the other teams uh well i don't know
i don't think that well they have to
come from
friton ecosystem i think so yeah
in fact anyone can participate who has
enough knowledge on how to do this
uh so so uh if it's possible to
distribute this information
uh across june community that there will
be such a contest
so please guys come participate in the
design stage and then implementation
stage
so uh you're welcome and uh
taking the specificity of this contest
so we will need to select i guess one
uh winning solution that will be used to
perform the transfer of tokens to the
swap of tokens
uh and it should be also dually governed
so uh i sorry i didn't get the last um
government i mean that uh this is
the point where the huge amount of money
will be transferred
yeah and it should be uh con i think
done under the control of some people or
some reputable people
from both sides and this also should be
tackled within the architecture stage
so how it will be done because this is
not clear for me
from from the proposal and
last but not least we have
done a lot of improvements in our
procedural parts in the device of
governance and
i will share with you an example of
recent contests uh how we do this so
just briefly speaking it will mean we
will just need to get rid of half of
text from the proposal and just put the
reference to the
uh some specific documents which just
summarizes all of these main blocks and
that's it
uh in all the rest yeah it's it's a nice
proposal and
if we just tackle these three points so
it's fine
one more thing is that uh asset will be
funded from
the main governance uh so we will just
need to
to write this specifically uh inside
so and maybe we will uh formally run
this
under the main governance interface but
the
jurors groups will be from defy and from
devex
so yeah so uh i will do my best
to just update your proposal uh
this week hopefully tomorrow and just
will
drop the updated version uh in the group
so to make everything
so what i understand is that there will
be a first contest of two weeks
yeah so starting next week in some way
uh
for the architecture and then the the
next contest will be the implementation
itself yeah
exactly as a result of the
implementation can we
do you think we can get something that
every team will
in some way deploy the solution on the
network sometimes i don't know so we'll
choose between them now yeah we will see
this
should be the uh outcome of the design
stage
so on how this should be done and this
is why this stage
is also crucial because uh it helps you
to prevent a lot of mistakes in the
implementation stage
so you you will have several teams
competing uh
with the proposed architectures that
will be tackling these
governance issues it will be tackling
this
issue of how to this
source code should be used whether it
will be just one interface or
multiple interfaces or whatever so
i don't have the answer now but uh
that's why we run design stage
first actually yeah so uh
and at the end so we will definitely
achieve our objective
okay guys do you have any questions of a
breeze please
yes i have questions about dune network
and maybe about developers team indian
network
how many team you have and
what we should do if you want to
move with teams to frito network
because we need a lot of developers and
a lot of
we want to create a lot of projects in
our system
so uh so there is the main team which is
the origin labs
who i am part of
and i think that for the other teams
i know at least two other projects
that are on you know that are being
developed
one is actually already uh
i've already been retargeted to return
so i think that team i will contact them
because of course
they have both knowledges and for
for everyone i don't know exactly what
what they're doing right now
[Music]
at this point so of course
june being a fork of tesos there is
there are all the teams from the teso
ecosystem but
at this point it's not clear whether
they are going to
want to participate in this contest i
mean they are focused on you
know also so it's not clear
what what's well the tech well the
technology of tesos is uh
if they know it they are able to use it
for fortune
so so they can be part of it but
uh i can't tell uh if
[Music]
if they are going to participate so so
for for the
for the developers themselves uh i think
there are only three small for a small
team
one big on two small ones uh
in the in the community so uh one of is
already part of return in some way
right now so
so i i don't know if it might reply your
feels what your replies to your question
but
yes thank you thank you
good any other questions guys
three two one no thank you for breathe
so and
uh yeah we have one hand raised sanzor
please yeah hello
um i wanted to ask a similar question
but not about
the dev teams uh rather about some
projects that are
uh that can bring more publicity or
pr or well other things that need to be
attended in freetown as well as any
other
developing project in case we we have
this
merge uh we'll need to
sort of unify the forces to
to attract more people and to attract
more user base
and possibly to attract i don't know
tess's user base as well
and similar blockchains that are
looking to have real use cases so
my question is about the the
non-development part of the community uh
is it yeah can we
what are the benefits that when we can
uh
have from this if you can comment on
this thank you
well the benefits are that i think that
the
the june community in some way is a
complementary
of the of the friton community
uh they are very active indeed they are
most of them are coming
well that are coming above in texas
and in the june community so i think
that
the the good thing with that is that
there will be
a bridge uh between uh also tesos
on the on the on the earth or
return and also um
there are well they have uh
well the community is very active and
well they have a telegram a discord and
all these channels as in freeton but
they are from
more from western uh europe european
countries uh
france also a lot of course
tesos is a lot in france
so i think
i mean we already uh have uh
have been who is uh uh
very active in the freeton community now
with uh
what's our former uh uh well
what's the name for that communicant
well a
technological evangelist so now he's a
friend evangelist
and and i hope that a lot of people like
him are going to
to come from the well of course there
are validators also we had a lot of
validators on
on june so the dune validators are in
some way easier to
to run because they are less demanding
than
[Music]
but some of them
are very interested in becoming
validators on return and so i think it's
important also for britain to have
more validators coming uh from this part
of the world
on the uh on well
well right now they are waiting for the
tokens to be on
on friton so so they cannot yet well so
i know that i have
i have started to work with some of them
on the roster the contest
but uh but still uh we are blocked in
some way by the
uh by our tokens being on dune or not on
friton
okay thank you thank you for answering
thank you febreze
thank you
any other questions
no well done fabrice thank you so much
for your feedback so
uh as promised i will just provide you
with my feedback
soon soonish
hopefully tomorrow a lot of things
should be done
uh yeah so but we will do our best to
run this as soon as possible
uh now let's move to the next topic so
uh as i said
bulka dot bridge team windex team has
published a
uh they think for the second stage to
the
governance interface and the voting is
open for one week already
so uh there are still not so many votes
so i invite everyone who is on the
jury team to participate and
invest their time just run all the
source code and check
so seven days to go and the voting ends
just a kind reminder next thing is about
is to discuss the external jurors thing
uh as you may remember it was couple of
weeks ago when we
discussed the possibility to attract
external jurors from
other sub-governances namely starting
with devex subgovernance and
to help us assessing the smart contracts
part
and finally i created the document
that just establishes such an
opportunity for us
and it's very short actually but
still it is something that needs to be
tackled with uh attention
yeah and i invite everyone just to
review this document
and uh if i missed something here
and that you think it is important
so please do not hesitate to just leave
your feedback there
or just you may write me directly uh
and if it's okay so i propose to run it
for voting tomorrow or month or on
monday
and uh in this case we will have
the opportunity to attract the
additional jurors starting from the next
two contests which are namely
uh stable coin contest and the contest
for
ethereum breach stage two so and
we will already be enjoying the
additional brains in our team who will
help us to improve the quality of the
solutions uh and
uh last but not least topic on the
agenda is um
the one that i named back bound it's
always this is a topic for discussion
today
and uh let me just ignite the intro and
i would like to hear your opinions as
well so we have a lot of
uh highly complex technical solutions
being developed within device
subgovernance and
this is something that really needs to
be
debugged definitely there is no source
code without bugs you know
and our main target is to make it
as have
as slow number of bugs as possible
and as you remember normally in our
technical context there is a last stage
named
security audit but before security audit
will be performed uh i think it is
will be a good idea to run a bug bounty
program on
any solutions that have been developed
within the device of governance
uh so uh i have for now no idea of
what the prices should be or
should it be recurring or maybe a fixed
contest
or should it last one week or one month
uh
i just believe strongly believe that
it's something that we really need
uh okay so i would like to to hear your
opinions on that
please raise your hands
yes okay please you were the first
um actually i'm thinking uh
can you hear me yes yes yes please yeah
i'm thinking
um is it possible to make a bug bounty
program
like repeating every
month or maybe every half of a year
because usually in
from a practice box appears
not from during the starting period of
using the software they are appearing
from some
time from time to time during whole
life cycle of the software so what do
you think about
creating bug bounty repeating
this program contests and
assign such rewards
that will make some
we're broken the software and uh
no economically effective
i mean if some guy will find a bug
for him it will be much easier faster
and economically reasonable
to report it instead of trying to
make something wrong with the software
this is my point
yes i agree that uh backbone is
something that's
normally run or repeated
in a repeated way and
there is of course should be the
different rewards
for different severity of bugs
meaning that for example if a guy found
some
zero-day bug within the
the code and reported it so it should be
dually rewarded
because it really affects the whole
ecosystem
yes yes yes yes i have an idea
i i want to attract uh
immunity to the fake system
where professional in a different
back-bound program in different
blockchain and the file system
it's one of portfolio company of our
member of house of governments
and i think uh zorab can create intro
with their team and maybe we can
get any consultation from them and run
program
and for example in our program we can
create a budget reward for it
and we can use not only on crystal we
also can use
bridge bridge governance token uh texas
governance talking and etc
i think it will be very interesting
because uh nobody know
uh how many vista can uh
will cost in in some months and maybe it
will be big money maybe it will be
nothing
uh let's see uh but i think it will be
interesting
uh great budget from uh tom crystal and
uh from uh
project governor stephens yes
sounds really really good i'm looking
through it so
it's very interesting one
can i raise my hand yes yes so please
please
interface of zoom but i haven't seen it
so so i raised my
real end uh actually we had a discussion
in the
uh formal verification sub governance
about the backbone t2
and i was wondering if it would not be
better for return to have just one bug
bounty program for all sub governances
instead of multiple ones because
if i find them back somewhere then i
have if
i am i don't know too much about the
sub-governances then
i won't know exactly to which uh
sub-governance i should go
uh on the having just one uh
ubuntu program for off-return where then
uh
the jurors can be this can decide all
these speculatives about this subject
then we will
send the the the the
well the email to uh
these good subgovernance is sometimes
better
than to have multiple ones well i don't
know if it is easily feasible but
i think it would be better
well at least uh
there may be one touch point for
such bounty programs and describing
where you should go to participate in it
uh speaking for free tone so we have
actually different budget for different
sub governances and
there are uh a number of sub governances
that are really developing something
and who require some bug bounty really
so this is devex then defiant and
somehow some others but direction
defines the most intensive ones
uh so
so if i understand this right so
immunify will publish
all our bounty program on their website
right and yes um as rob
told to us it's not number one in this
market
uh for three different uh boundary
program uh we have
different mechanics for it and they have
a heightened community
who are records of it and i think it
will be a very very good stage
from from outside uh starts work with
immunity
and we can attract uh
hikers from the munich community
sounds really good
any uh other ideas guys please
raise your hands and say something
yes media please um hi um
could you try to imagine
could you try to say uh some what would
be the size of
over prizes in immunity
system because i see the million and a
half
on the first place what do you think
about
our bug bounty programs in defy
subgovernance
which we can publish here uh i
i think we can create budget up to 100k
dollars
in uh taunt and in governance token
and uh because because uh
we are not dealt now we need some time
uh
for freetown and for our project to be
big and
before we're not big it's uh i think
it's it's it's maximum
and it's not and it's program
not only for one buck in one project
it's a
program for uh different bugs
in our products
okay yeah and average you see it is up
to 50k
normally so it's only on the first page
the most
lucrative ones but the majority has the
maximum bound of 55 50k sorry
what's wrong with my tongue today uh
yeah
and the figures should be really uh
discussed so it's it's not
the answer that we can give right now so
uh
yeah yeah sure let's propose and discuss
so
finally we will just find some something
fair
i i want to remind just we had several
bounty programs in friton
already so it was for the app uh server
and the one for tons of uh
and the prices there were up to 35k i
guess
so meet me you may know a bit a little
bit better
by the way mita how did they go so
actually uh
we're very happy with the results and
maybe you can just uh propose to us
suggestions on the back on the bug
program on the backbone
yeah we actually during the summer uh
time
and now with the rust cup we have a
kind of bug bouncy running in parallel
with the contest and it was very good i
mean
we there were some bugs found and we
already have some bug found
during this contest as well so it
i don't know i had that just this
experience
so that worked well do you have
something that you would like
would make better if you had the chance
so uh
so for us to learn from you yeah well
again in terms of no i think that
again if you want to kind of we work
with the same community that
participate in the contest so they
participate in the contest during
participation they kind of figure out
oh there is a bug here but it's back
there they report the bugs
and we we kind of pay them after that
you know
kind of running then we after the
contest we kind of
collect all the all the data and and
kind of getting reward structure for
that okay um
just classifying the bugs during the
severity and
uh have a table you know with all the
bugs with all the
who reported them what the severity is
and then kind of
the prize pool is divided
um i really don't know how to best
organize that
it can be organized in very different
ways we can run
we can have a ongoing
bug contest as fabrice said
uh in parallel we can run special
contests for
particulars like bugs to find bugs in
particular
solutions you know i don't think it's
one conflicting another
and of course you need to just
account that you have four that you have
like
two in parallel or whatever so you
should say that the one bug cannot be
submitted into two or three more
so on but other than that i don't know
that's uh i think it's open kind of
everyone should decide what's better for
for particular i mean
because different software different
solutions have different
probably ways to approach like the bug
bounty program
i guess um that's why i don't think that
we just
can have one program that covers it all
for all the cases because there are
several
a few cases that are very kind of can be
very different
for example if you just run a bug bounty
program for just general bugs and
in smart contracts and in software
and then you have the uh the validators
contest
it it it should you know
people will not report the bugs in the
general program because they won't
think it fit or the requirements for bug
reporting will be different
and stuff like that so it for us it's
still
worthwhile to run a separate
uh you know contest for the for the
validator contest bug bounty for example
okay nevertheless despite the fact that
we may have a general problem
can you somehow at least classify such
bug bounty programs and
at least say in advance and well
not well maybe in advance maybe based on
on the current experience
for example we're we're like we report
we're now releasing the security card
that we have
right and security card already we
already released by the way several open
source software tools for the security
card in our repository i don't know we
didn't really announce that but
you can actually see that it's there um
the security card now is ready to be
shipped to the to the developers more or
less
and of course we need to run a bug
bounty program but that's a very
specialized very specific bug bounty
program for this particular
device with this particular libraries we
want to look into particular things
like there is a process that we
developed for delivery of the car the
men in the middle stuff they
the the special security uh
system of of uh ensuring that the cart
uh cannot be tempered with over the
whole uh
not only delivery process but also
manufacturing process
and that is that is uh you know that
that technology would definitely want to
you know to test and hackers to find
bugs and
i don't again i think that we will run a
special
kind of bug bounty contest just for that
because because again it's it's a very
special thing there is it requires
very special people to do that like
people who can
go and try to side channel attack the
like the cart itself
and uh you know what not like really
it's not the same
people who hug the like the smart
contract
it's a it's a different it's different
people has different requirements
it should be also different prices i
think
okay okay yeah and this is actually uh
what i would like to to hear so um at
least
to kind of frame uh that
we have backbone these programs i don't
know
for smart contracts back bounty for
uh validator nodes back bounty for
something else
and uh there will be a four comprises
starting you know
for uh finding bugs in
public interfaces like you know turn
live or ton explorer or whatever
so it will be from 500 to
5000 for example and for finding bugs in
validator nodes
it will just give will give from 1 000
to 100 000
so um at least to
facilitate and standardize kind of uh
such contests so to have us
definitely you can do that i said i mean
definitely you can do that
and definitely you can of course there
will be like more i think categories but
you definitely can
formalize such a system smart contracts
that a very specific category
yeah uh which definitely is a critical
for the whole system like
bug in the protocol right the bargain
virtual machine the bugging compilers
the bug and like
yeah you can specify these kind of
things and run that forever
in parallel but it doesn't cancel
for me the specialized yeah yeah
definitely definitely
that's just that's all i said i mean
yeah i just dressed in this because uh
we see a lot of uh comments from the
community that
uh this or that prize is not fair
yeah because uh because one contest has
this price and this
this contest it has another price uh of
course
it's always uh can be disputed and
uh whatever but if we have a system that
says
that for such kind of contests we have
the price fund from this to that
it will be really transparent for people
and they will
understand all the conditions better
[Music]
well we are now working with andre
election
on on enhancing the draft four of the
bftg
where it will we actually like
uh run a lot of like
thought in into that um of how
you actually price the contest
price pull the contest like what how you
calculate the price pool
can you do that automatically like what
should what the input should be to
calculate that and so on and so forth
and there is a solution like which we
will propose on the draft for of pftg
now i will publish it probably by monday
where like you only need to kind of
you only need to categorize what would
you pay in tokus for the best possible
solution to this problem
and what is the time duration that you
want
to kind of have that solution win
and from that we will construct
everything else
like all the rest of the contest price
pool
jury remuneration um
the jury voting time everything will be
like calculated from that now
then since there are tags attached to
each of the contests uh in bftg
you then can kind of collect statistics
for the particular tag on usually like
what what are the parameters of the
particular attack
and we're we're talking about that there
so actually like
you can then parameterize text
on base of this like the contest that
you run and how successful they were
because we actually can measure the
successful
the the success of the contest in
reverse
in like so
then you will have like tags
and usual price pool attached to them
usual kind of the cost of the of the
best solution on that
attack and so on so you can kind of
construct things
and based on that of course they are not
up you know absolute and you always okay
definitely definitely this is just just
just to give some reason original
but you have a few but you will have
some some stats you will have some
some data attached to each of this so
in a way that will kind of mitigate what
people
like say it's not fair or not fair
whatever or
time is not enough for whatever they say
usually yeah
yeah yeah right so of course it's it's
again it's not some kind of rule that
you cannot change but
but at least you will have some
guidelines and people will have some
guidelines to look at this
retrospectively and say okay so
that's probably fair because it's in
line with what you know most of the time
with
you know community pays for that that
the results are good
you know and good results means to have
some
you know submissions at least three five
submissions for the contest
and the results of the contest are
usually in the high numbers of say
you know uh the submissions
marks jury marks then you can say okay
so this was
a successful contest and we run this
contest contest constantly like
in this tag and we have you know usually
successful cons with this parameter so
you can say okay you can say conveniency
this is fair parameters because we have
the stats
okay okay fabrice you wanted to say
something
well i i just wanted to say that you you
instead of attaching the prices to
the software maybe you could
attach it to the impact of the attack
so for example you would have a an
amount of tokens for
if the attack is could block the world
blockchain for example
another one if can people can use it to
steal
tokens to people and on so forth
you you could uh instead of saying well
if it isn't live
or in this place well any attack on any
website that is used by the community a
lot
and that could be used to uh make people
believe something or
to do well to to take tokens from ex
for example from extraton i think
the the the idea is not that they can
attack this software of this sovereign
one this other software
it's whether they can steal tokens
whether they can block the network
whether they can block one validator
or well do uh targeted attacks
uh uh i i would the the amounts would be
different
uh from that point of view instead of
the software that it is being being
attacked
yeah i agree i agree i agree and we
actually discussed this
with our team that uh in fact
the motivation for reporting the back
should be enough
for a guy to report instead of exploit
so uh
so yeah this is
said truth yeah so and uh if there is a
protocol which
in which there are i don't know millions
of dollars locked
so and the guy finds a zero zero day
evil
vulnerability that he can easily exploit
to just
take out this money so he should be
rewarded for not doing this since
reporting it timely yeah so it's complex
to a complex
issue any other opinions guys
three two one no very good
now it's a time for open discussion so
and
[Music]
one more topic that i didn't include
actually on the agenda
but i wanted to share some idea with you
and just get your feedback as well
uh what do you think if we try to
insert a short just news digest
inside our weekly call covering maybe
some
some most crucial events in the device
here
[Music]
not only in free tone but also in
ethereum and other networks
uh what do you think about this
yes it's it's one of the goals the fire
alliance
team because all funds have
internal digest and we are talking about
insight
that we need to create combine combine
digest and provide and
i think we can do ignot responsible for
your task
okay yes and
we will solve it in this format yeah i
propose
just a brief format uh maybe 10 minutes
devote
not more than 10 minutes during each
call to
just uh tell the the major news and
explain uh
why is it important actually because no
no i think
i think it's about text and links
formats
like like message telegram
okay so we can just publish this
in the group of the default yes
okay okay
any other opinions guys
no okay then thank everyone for
attending and
i wish you a nice weekend and see you
next week then bye bye
see you next week bye bye bye
bye everyone
