00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,190
with the tech updates
yeah don't have much actually we kind of

176
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
yeah don't have much actually we kind of
 

177
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,190
yeah don't have much actually we kind of
rolling as i said

178
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
rolling as i said
 

179
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,670
rolling as i said
they upgrade to the network slowly

180
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
they upgrade to the network slowly
 

181
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,110
they upgrade to the network slowly
and

182
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
and
 

183
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,860
and
there are some

184
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:45,870
there are some
 

185
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,430
there are some

187
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,550
[Music]
kind of

188
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
kind of
 

189
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,470
kind of
complicated

190
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
complicated
 

191
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,710
complicated
stuff bottom line

192
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
stuff bottom line
 

193
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,309
stuff bottom line
but safety first

194
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
but safety first
 

195
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,429
but safety first
so

196
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
so
 

197
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,350
so
very very gradual update

198
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360

 

199
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,550

still

200
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
still
 

201
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,070
still
um

202
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
um
 

203
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,190
um
like

204
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
like
 

205
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,949
like
about

206
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
about
 

207
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,550
about
eighty percent of our validators have

208
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
eighty percent of our validators have
 

209
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,309
eighty percent of our validators have
been upgraded

210
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
been upgraded
 

211
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,229
been upgraded
um i've seen some issues we have fixed

212
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
um i've seen some issues we have fixed
 

213
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,830
um i've seen some issues we have fixed
some issues so

214
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
some issues so
 

215
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,470
some issues so
that's um going on once we're

216
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
that's um going on once we're
 

217
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,629
that's um going on once we're
certain it's okay

218
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
certain it's okay
 

219
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,830
certain it's okay
at this thing we are going to

220
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
at this thing we are going to
 

221
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,349
at this thing we are going to
slowly reduce it

222
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
slowly reduce it
 

223
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,629
slowly reduce it
hopefully like

224
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
hopefully like
 

225
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,629
hopefully like
maybe even today

226
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
maybe even today
 

227
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,270
maybe even today

because there is a there is as i said

232
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
because there is a there is as i said
 

233
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,790
because there is a there is as i said
there is a big um

234
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
there is a big um
 

235
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,390
there is a big um
like probability that the network will

236
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
like probability that the network will
 

237
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,990
like probability that the network will
hold halt if we

238
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
hold halt if we
 

239
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,590
hold halt if we
just release the upgrade because it

240
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
just release the upgrade because it
 

241
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,469
just release the upgrade because it
takes

242
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
takes
 

243
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,550
takes
sometimes about half an hour 40 minutes

244
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
sometimes about half an hour 40 minutes
 

245
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,189
sometimes about half an hour 40 minutes
for a network to kind of

246
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
for a network to kind of
 

247
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,070
for a network to kind of
repair the database so if we just go and

248
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
repair the database so if we just go and
 

249
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,590
repair the database so if we just go and
release it everyone will start doing

250
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
release it everyone will start doing
 

251
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,350
release it everyone will start doing
this and

252
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
this and
 

253
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,909
this and
the network will stall for some time so

254
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
the network will stall for some time so
 

255
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,990
the network will stall for some time so
we don't want to do that obviously so

256
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
we don't want to do that obviously so
 

257
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,950
we don't want to do that obviously so
kind of

258
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
kind of
 

259
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,749
kind of
that's that's complication of stuff

260
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
that's that's complication of stuff
 

261
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,390
that's that's complication of stuff
so yeah apart from that

262
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
so yeah apart from that
 

263
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,350
so yeah apart from that
apart from that we are very busy on

264
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360
apart from that we are very busy on
 

265
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,870
apart from that we are very busy on

267
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,909
ramp
and

268
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
and

00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
it's already in
 

271
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,550
it's already in
in basically it's kind of in high load

272
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
in basically it's kind of in high load
 

273
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,950
in basically it's kind of in high load
testing now

274
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
testing now
 

275
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,749
testing now
and

276
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
and
 

277
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,230
and
it has also

278
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
it has also
 

279
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,830
it has also
sdk

280
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840

284
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
production
 

285
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,710
production
which

286
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720
which
 

287
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,350
which
will take until uh may 10th something

288
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
will take until uh may 10th something
 

289
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,310
will take until uh may 10th something
like that and uh we hope that

290
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
like that and uh we hope that
 

291
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,950
like that and uh we hope that
like on the week of may 10th

um we're going to
 

295
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,749
um we're going to
kind of try to push ramp

296
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
kind of try to push ramp
 

297
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,310
kind of try to push ramp
maybe towards like 15 we'll try to push

298
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
maybe towards like 15 we'll try to push
 

299
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,590
maybe towards like 15 we'll try to push
them into devnet see how that goes

300
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
them into devnet see how that goes
 

301
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,710
them into devnet see how that goes
and

302
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
and
 

303
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,270
and
from there you know whatever time

304
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
from there you know whatever time
 

305
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,749
from there you know whatever time
requires for everyone to adapt to but up

306
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
requires for everyone to adapt to but up
 

307
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,230
requires for everyone to adapt to but up
their applications because

308
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
their applications because
 

309
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,590
their applications because
they will have

310
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
they will have
 

311
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,990
they will have
a few statuses new statuses that they

312
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
a few statuses new statuses that they
 

313
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,270
a few statuses new statuses that they
can

314
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
can
 

315
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,590
can
you know fit their application with they

316
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
you know fit their application with they
 

317
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,909
you know fit their application with they
can decide based on the statuses if they

318
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
can decide based on the statuses if they
 

319
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,749
can decide based on the statuses if they
want to wait

320
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
want to wait
 

321
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,270
want to wait
until

322
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
until
 

323
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,309
until
kind of

324
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
kind of
 

325
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,790
kind of
the final finality or they are okay with

326
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
the final finality or they are okay with
 

327
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,629
the final finality or they are okay with
just letting

328
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
just letting
 

329
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,110
just letting
um the first status which basically

330
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
um the first status which basically
 

331
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,350
um the first status which basically
means like there are several statuses

332
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
means like there are several statuses
 

333
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,629
means like there are several statuses
and for some applications actually the

334
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
and for some applications actually the
 

335
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,870
and for some applications actually the
first one will be enough like uh if it's

336
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
first one will be enough like uh if it's
 

337
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,309
first one will be enough like uh if it's

you can just you know close the

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,189
you can just you know close the

almost certain like with a very high
 

355
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,150
almost certain like with a very high
probability like nine nine point some

have uh you know several transactions in
 

377
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,909
have uh you know several transactions in
the chain then

00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
the chain then
 

379
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,230
the chain then
you know

380
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
you know
 

381
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,589
you know
like depends on what the chain of

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,950
um
you may wait until you know the final

00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
you may wait until you know the final

not necessarily because sometimes you

not necessarily because sometimes you
if the contracts that are transacting

394
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
if the contracts that are transacting
 

395
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,029
if the contracts that are transacting
are only the user contracts and you can

396
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
are only the user contracts and you can
 

397
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,629
are only the user contracts and you can
predict that they will be okay because

398
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
predict that they will be okay because
 

399
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,309
predict that they will be okay because
you know that

400
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
you know that
 

401
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,830
you know that
from the first message external message

402
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
from the first message external message
 

403
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,189
from the first message external message
if the first external message is

404
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
if the first external message is
 

405
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,270
if the first external message is
delivered then the rest of the messages

406
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
delivered then the rest of the messages
 

407
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,670
delivered then the rest of the messages
will be will be delivered for sure and

408
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
will be will be delivered for sure and
 

409
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,110
will be will be delivered for sure and
if you're certain that your smart

410
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
if you're certain that your smart
 

411
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,029
if you're certain that your smart
contract will execute them then you

412
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
contract will execute them then you
 

413
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,309
contract will execute them then you
don't need to wait

414
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,319
don't need to wait
 

415
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,629
don't need to wait
so a lot of decisions to be made on the

416
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:34,639
so a lot of decisions to be made on the
 

417
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,749
so a lot of decisions to be made on the
on the kind of user side of things

418
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
on the kind of user side of things
 

419
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,670
on the kind of user side of things
uh the developer side of things and we

420
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
uh the developer side of things and we
 

421
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,909
uh the developer side of things and we
will allow some time for that but yeah

422
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
will allow some time for that but yeah
 

423
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,589
will allow some time for that but yeah
but right now okay as i said the ramp is

424
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
but right now okay as i said the ramp is
 

425
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,150
but right now okay as i said the ramp is
our priority

426
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,160
our priority
 

427
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,189
our priority
currently for the next like big network

so the question is uh what is a
there are a few questions actually so

452
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800
there are a few questions actually so
 

453
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,189
there are a few questions actually so
the first is um

454
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
the first is um
 

455
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,150
the first is um
uh

456
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
uh
 

457
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,990
uh
what what is the status of a new

458
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
what what is the status of a new
 

459
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,270
what what is the status of a new
consensus

460
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
consensus
 

461
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,270
consensus
because this community member thinks

462
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
because this community member thinks
 

463
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,670
because this community member thinks
that new consensus is much more

464
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
that new consensus is much more
 

465
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,310
that new consensus is much more
important than the ramp and he

466
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
important than the ramp and he
 

467
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,670
important than the ramp and he
like uh

468
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
like uh
 

469
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,670
like uh
his opinion is that we don't need trump

470
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
his opinion is that we don't need trump
 

471
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,829
his opinion is that we don't need trump
we need new consensus first but but

472
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839
we need new consensus first but but
 

473
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,670
we need new consensus first but but
basically can you elaborate on new

474
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
basically can you elaborate on new
 

475
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,430
basically can you elaborate on new
consensus thing and uh how how soon can

476
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
consensus thing and uh how how soon can
 

477
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,389
consensus thing and uh how how soon can
we uh like expect it to to come to

478
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
we uh like expect it to to come to
 

479
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,590
we uh like expect it to to come to
devnet at least and and what is which is

480
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
devnet at least and and what is which is
 

481
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,550
devnet at least and and what is which is
most most important will there be

482
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
most most important will there be
 

483
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,509
most most important will there be
some some document with more like

484
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
some some document with more like
 

485
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,550
some some document with more like
in-depth description of new consensus uh

486
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
in-depth description of new consensus uh
 

487
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,030
in-depth description of new consensus uh
because we see that in a white paper

488
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
because we see that in a white paper
 

489
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,790
because we see that in a white paper
that there is some high-level

490
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
that there is some high-level
 

491
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,710
that there is some high-level
description of consensus but will there

492
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
description of consensus but will there
 

493
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,509
description of consensus but will there
be a technical like specification or or

494
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
be a technical like specification or or
 

495
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,509
be a technical like specification or or
something

496
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
something
 

497
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,509
something
okay i will start from the beginning

498
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
okay i will start from the beginning
 

499
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,509
okay i will start from the beginning
then first of all the sun token is

500
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
then first of all the sun token is
 

501
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,550
then first of all the sun token is
trading at 2.83

502
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
trading at 2.83
 

503
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,910
trading at 2.83
but tdl is kind of 86 000. so i think

504
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
but tdl is kind of 86 000. so i think
 

505
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,230
but tdl is kind of 86 000. so i think
the the you need to increase the tvl

506
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
the the you need to increase the tvl
 

507
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,550
the the you need to increase the tvl
before before you ask a question how

508
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
before before you ask a question how
 

509
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,750
before before you ask a question how
soon

510
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
soon
 

511
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,150
soon
that's i because i cannot you know i

512
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
that's i because i cannot you know i
 

513
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,829
that's i because i cannot you know i
cannot trade on the token with such a

514
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839
cannot trade on the token with such a
 

515
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,150
cannot trade on the token with such a
low liquidity

516
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
low liquidity
 

517
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,870
low liquidity
we need we need more of this

518
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
we need we need more of this
 

519
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,350
we need we need more of this
so i can i can make better predictions

520
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
so i can i can make better predictions
 

521
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,230
so i can i can make better predictions
on how soon something will be there

522
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
on how soon something will be there
 

523
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,829
on how soon something will be there
so that's that's um about how soon

524
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
so that's that's um about how soon
 

525
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,509
so that's that's um about how soon
for the priority on the series on a

526
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
for the priority on the series on a
 

527
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,269
for the priority on the series on a
serious note yeah on the serious note

528
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
serious note yeah on the serious note
 

529
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,590
serious note yeah on the serious note
for some for the priorities

530
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
for some for the priorities
 

531
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,310
for some for the priorities
all right so uh first of all

532
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,320
all right so uh first of all
 

533
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,350
all right so uh first of all
um

534
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
um
 

535
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,710
um
there are different people who work on

536
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
there are different people who work on
 

537
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,750
there are different people who work on
ramp in the consensus that's one thing

538
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
ramp in the consensus that's one thing
 

539
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,310
ramp in the consensus that's one thing
second the fear second thing is that

540
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,320
second the fear second thing is that
 

541
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,870
second the fear second thing is that
one is not less important than the other

542
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
one is not less important than the other
 

543
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,550
one is not less important than the other
i mean i understand there is an opinion

544
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:06,560
i mean i understand there is an opinion
 

545
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,910
i mean i understand there is an opinion
that something is more important than

546
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
that something is more important than
 

547
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,949
that something is more important than
the other

548
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:08,959
the other
 

549
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,509
the other
but um it's not and

550
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
but um it's not and
 

551
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,750
but um it's not and
but again it doesn't matter even if it

552
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
but again it doesn't matter even if it
 

553
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,750
but again it doesn't matter even if it
would i couldn't make it faster

554
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
would i couldn't make it faster
 

555
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,990
would i couldn't make it faster
just by adding more people it doesn't

556
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
just by adding more people it doesn't
 

557
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,310
just by adding more people it doesn't
work like that really

558
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
work like that really
 

559
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,670
work like that really
so um the new consensus is in progress

560
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
so um the new consensus is in progress
 

561
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,269
so um the new consensus is in progress
it it's

562
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
it it's
 

563
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,790
it it's
it has a

564
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
it has a
 

565
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,670
it has a
it has a kind of working

566
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
it has a kind of working
 

567
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,150
it has a kind of working

um
 

571
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,910
um
there is a technical documentation about

572
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
there is a technical documentation about
 

573
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,790
there is a technical documentation about
the about this which is not released yet

574

the about this which is not released yet
 

575
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,870
the about this which is not released yet
i mean it's released but not publicly

576
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
i mean it's released but not publicly
 

577
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,550
i mean it's released but not publicly
the technical specifications of the new

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
the technical specifications of the new
 

579
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,630
the technical specifications of the new
consensus and uh

580
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:46,640
consensus and uh
 

581
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,389
consensus and uh
i don't think it will be released before

582
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
i don't think it will be released before
 

583
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,350
i don't think it will be released before
the middle uh like of may

584
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360
the middle uh like of may
 

585
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,069
the middle uh like of may
uh that's what i think now

586
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
uh that's what i think now
 

587
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,990
uh that's what i think now
now um but

588
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000
now um but
 

589
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,910
now um but
this is because we worked on the

590
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:57,920
this is because we worked on the
 

591
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,509
this is because we worked on the
specification the specification not so

592
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
specification the specification not so
 

593
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,790
specification the specification not so
much a description i mean we have a

594
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
much a description i mean we have a
 

595
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,230
much a description i mean we have a
description already

596
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
description already
 

597
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,430
description already
but rather

598
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
but rather
 

599
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,949
but rather
kind of we

600
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:04,959
kind of we
 

601
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,030
kind of we
like made an effort and this is a um

602
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
like made an effort and this is a um
 

603
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,069
like made an effort and this is a um

611
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,230
research
we added additional mathematician to to

612
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
we added additional mathematician to to
 

613
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,030
we added additional mathematician to to
that we're counting

614
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,040
that we're counting
 

615
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,389
that we're counting
all sorts of

all sorts of
 

617
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,190
all sorts of
probabilities around this i mean you

618
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,200
probabilities around this i mean you
 

619
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,470
probabilities around this i mean you
understand it's a probabilistic

620
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
understand it's a probabilistic
 

621
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,870
understand it's a probabilistic
consensus so you cannot prove or

622
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
consensus so you cannot prove or
 

623
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,030
consensus so you cannot prove or
disprove completely like something

624
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,040
disprove completely like something
 

625
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,150
disprove completely like something
because there is it's not the

626
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
because there is it's not the
 

627
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,350
because there is it's not the
probability of one um

628
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
probability of one um
 

629
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,750
probability of one um
so well you can claim that and i can i

630
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:39,760
so well you can claim that and i can i
 

631
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,990
so well you can claim that and i can i
can claim that every consensus network

00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
can claim that every consensus network

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,670
can claim that every consensus network
concerns protocol is probabilistic but

634
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
concerns protocol is probabilistic but
 

635
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,710
concerns protocol is probabilistic but
uh you know it it depends on how you

636
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:46,720
uh you know it it depends on how you
 

637
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,750
uh you know it it depends on how you
view the probability and of what

638
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
view the probability and of what
 

639
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,629
view the probability and of what
but

640
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,639
but
 

641
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,470
but
if you say that bfc concerns the

if you say that bfc concerns the

in terms of real application is
 

661
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,629
in terms of real application is
so indistinguishable

662
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
so indistinguishable
 

663
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,389
so indistinguishable
from the security standpoint that it

00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
from the security standpoint that it
 

665
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,670
from the security standpoint that it
doesn't matter

666
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
doesn't matter
 

667
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,150
doesn't matter
but we have to be sure how close is this

668
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
but we have to be sure how close is this
 

669
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,550
but we have to be sure how close is this
to one and what are the kind of all

uh accounted in so will there be
 

677
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,150

there is no proof for probability there

there is no proof for probability there
 

683
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,470
there is no proof for probability there
is a count you can count the probability

684
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,480
is a count you can count the probability
 

685
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,949
is a count you can count the probability
that then then you can kind of

686
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
that then then you can kind of
 

687
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,910
that then then you can kind of
uh

688
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
uh
 

689
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,949
uh
you know

690
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
you know
 

691
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,110
you know
say that you didn't count correctly so

692
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
say that you didn't count correctly so
 

693
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,190
say that you didn't count correctly so
that's why we wanted to be sure that we

694
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,200
that's why we wanted to be sure that we
 

695
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,710
that's why we wanted to be sure that we
count correctly

696
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
count correctly
 

697
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,110
count correctly
right and that's why we have some

698
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
right and that's why we have some
 

699
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,030
right and that's why we have some
math behind this

700
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
math behind this
 

701
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,230
math behind this
now and behind things that

702
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
now and behind things that
 

703
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,949
now and behind things that
are even behind things that are kind of

704
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
are even behind things that are kind of
 

705
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,990
are even behind things that are kind of
obvious if you think about them like if

706
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
obvious if you think about them like if
 

707
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,750
obvious if you think about them like if
you think about them logically just a

708
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:01,760
you think about them logically just a
 

709
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,110
you think about them logically just a
logical

710
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
logical
 

711
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,670
logical
uh conclusion would be

712
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,680
uh conclusion would be
 

713
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,670
uh conclusion would be
that it's you know good enough

714
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
that it's you know good enough
 

715
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,110
that it's you know good enough
but

716
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
but
 

717
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,350
but
sometimes we don't want to be

718
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,360
sometimes we don't want to be
 

719
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,949
sometimes we don't want to be
uh relying on just logic so we want some

720
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
uh relying on just logic so we want some
 

721
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,350
uh relying on just logic so we want some
more formal methods

722
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
more formal methods
 

723
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,110
more formal methods
and uh you know of counting these things

724
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
and uh you know of counting these things
 

725
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,030
and uh you know of counting these things
including probabilities so

726
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
including probabilities so
 

727
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,190
including probabilities so
yeah so basically

728
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200
yeah so basically
 

729
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,550
yeah so basically
a lot of math

730
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
a lot of math
 

731
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,670
a lot of math
work went into consensus still going uh

732
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
work went into consensus still going uh
 

733
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,949
work went into consensus still going uh
as we speak

734
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
as we speak
 

735
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,069
as we speak
for last

736
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
for last
 

737
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,550
for last
you know four or five months

738
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
you know four or five months
 

739
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,550
you know four or five months
and we are very pleased with the results

740
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:36,560
and we are very pleased with the results
 

741
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,990
and we are very pleased with the results
we believe

742
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,000
we believe
 

743
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,069
we believe
if we didn't believe before we did but

744
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079
if we didn't believe before we did but
 

745
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,150
if we didn't believe before we did but
uh you know now we even more

746
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
uh you know now we even more
 

747
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,870
uh you know now we even more
believing that this consensus is really

748
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
believing that this consensus is really
 

749
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,430
believing that this consensus is really
great it's uh it's really great

750
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
great it's uh it's really great
 

751
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,030
great it's uh it's really great
and uh and then

752
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,040
and uh and then
 

753
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,870
and uh and then
there are some things that need to be

754
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
there are some things that need to be
 

755
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,910
there are some things that need to be
tuned in implementation level because

756
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
tuned in implementation level because
 

757
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,910
tuned in implementation level because
this there is there are it's not just

758
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
this there is there are it's not just
 

759
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,310
this there is there are it's not just
okay we're created we're like okay we we

760
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,320
okay we're created we're like okay we we
 

761
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,710
okay we're created we're like okay we we
invented new consensus that's not enough

762
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,720
invented new consensus that's not enough
 

763
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,710
invented new consensus that's not enough
because this concerns can be just bad

764
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
because this concerns can be just bad
 

765
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,230
because this concerns can be just bad
you know you can invest consensus which

766
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
you know you can invest consensus which
 

767
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,509
you know you can invest consensus which
is not

768
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
is not
 

769
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,069
is not
and we have this in practice a lot as

770
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
and we have this in practice a lot as
 

771
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,829
and we have this in practice a lot as
you know

772
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:09,839
you know
 

773
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,470
you know
flying around in this blockchain world

774
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
flying around in this blockchain world
 

775
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,629
flying around in this blockchain world
where everyone is creating new consensus

776
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
where everyone is creating new consensus
 

777
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,470
where everyone is creating new consensus
not necessarily every consensus is good

778
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:16,480
not necessarily every consensus is good
 

779
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,350
not necessarily every consensus is good
enough look at

780
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
enough look at
 

781
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,710
enough look at
cardano

782
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:20,720
cardano
 

783
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,389
cardano
for example right

784
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399

 

785
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,829

so no no slander here please yeah okay

786
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
so no no slander here please yeah okay
 

787
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,509
so no no slander here please yeah okay
okay

788
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
okay
 

789
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,189
okay
yeah great consensus i mean formally

790
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:31,199
yeah great consensus i mean formally
 

791
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,110
yeah great consensus i mean formally
proved or aborts formally proof

792
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
proved or aborts formally proof
 

793
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,189
proved or aborts formally proof
consensus just take more than 30 seconds

794
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:35,199
consensus just take more than 30 seconds
 

795
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,550
consensus just take more than 30 seconds
to finalize

796
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
to finalize
 

797
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,470
to finalize
so yeah we have a great consensus

798
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480
so yeah we have a great consensus
 

799
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,910
so yeah we have a great consensus
formally approved which is absolutely

800
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
formally approved which is absolutely
 

801
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,550
formally approved which is absolutely
unusable oh yeah i mean one of the

802
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560
unusable oh yeah i mean one of the
 

803
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,069
unusable oh yeah i mean one of the
important things about this consensus

804
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
important things about this consensus
 

805
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,629
important things about this consensus
practicality of it and and of course the

806
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
practicality of it and and of course the
 

807
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,629
practicality of it and and of course the
practicality is measured by finality

808
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:48,639
practicality is measured by finality
 

809
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,910
practicality is measured by finality
block times

810
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
block times
 

811
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,069
block times
all sorts of things like that

812
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
all sorts of things like that
 

813
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,910
all sorts of things like that
and um

814
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920
and um
 

815
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,990
and um
now we're working on improving the

816
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
now we're working on improving the
 

817
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,189
now we're working on improving the
finality even further uh because one

818
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
finality even further uh because one
 

819
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,110
finality even further uh because one
thing is to say okay

820
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,120
thing is to say okay
 

821
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,030
thing is to say okay
you know some there is a theoretical

822
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040
you know some there is a theoretical
 

823
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,949
you know some there is a theoretical
construct okay we send a message here

824
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:04,959
construct okay we send a message here
 

825
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,310
construct okay we send a message here
and there and that's okay i mean it's

826
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,320
and there and that's okay i mean it's
 

827
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,470
and there and that's okay i mean it's
okay from the standpoint of the safety

828
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
okay from the standpoint of the safety
 

829
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,550
okay from the standpoint of the safety
maybe but maybe it's not okay from the

830
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
maybe but maybe it's not okay from the
 

831
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,310
maybe but maybe it's not okay from the
standpoint of actual practical financial

832
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:12,320
standpoint of actual practical financial
 

833
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,829
standpoint of actual practical financial
analysis so

834
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:13,839
analysis so
 

835
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,870
analysis so
to to

836
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:14,880
to to
 

837
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,430
to to
to kind of decrease the finality

838
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:17,440
to kind of decrease the finality
 

839
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,150
to kind of decrease the finality
uh sometimes requires some additional

840
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
uh sometimes requires some additional
 

841
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,870
uh sometimes requires some additional
tricks on top and that's kind of what

842
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:22,880
tricks on top and that's kind of what
 

843
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,389
tricks on top and that's kind of what
we're doing so anyway

844
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:24,399
we're doing so anyway
 

845
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,470
we're doing so anyway
it's it's a work in progress

846
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:26,480
it's it's a work in progress
 

847
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,509
it's it's a work in progress
um we cannot speed it up

848
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
um we cannot speed it up
 

849
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,269
um we cannot speed it up
we cannot speed it up it will be when it

850
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,279
we cannot speed it up it will be when it
 

851
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,790
we cannot speed it up it will be when it
will be um

852
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
will be um
 

853
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,590
will be um
okay cool just just was interested in in

854
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
okay cool just just was interested in in
 

855
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,269
okay cool just just was interested in in
the current status so you described it

856
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:37,279
the current status so you described it
 

857
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,550
the current status so you described it
well thank you

858
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:38,560
well thank you
 

859
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,509
well thank you
and uh

860
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
and uh
 

861
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,069
and uh
and uh there is uh one one more question

862
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079
and uh there is uh one one more question
 

863
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,949
and uh there is uh one one more question
as well uh also from community uh i

864
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
as well uh also from community uh i
 

865
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,590
as well uh also from community uh i
already maybe know the answer but but

866
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,600
already maybe know the answer but but
 

867
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,990
already maybe know the answer but but
but we need like the some public

868
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,000
but we need like the some public
 

869
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,550
but we need like the some public
elaboration on that uh about the status

870
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
elaboration on that uh about the status
 

871
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,550
elaboration on that uh about the status
of drive changing

872
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:54,560
of drive changing
 

873
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,430
of drive changing
drive chain we started to develop it so

874
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
drive chain we started to develop it so
 

875
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,910
drive chain we started to develop it so
we're currently constructing well we

876
00:15:59,910 --> 00:15:59,920
we're currently constructing well we
 

877
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,790
we're currently constructing well we
kind of had a research where there is

878
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:02,800
kind of had a research where there is
 

879
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,910
kind of had a research where there is
our great alina uh who's a research

880
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:05,920
our great alina uh who's a research
 

881
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,269
our great alina uh who's a research
engineer in

882
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:07,279
engineer in
 

883
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,430
engineer in
cryptography

884
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:09,440
cryptography
 

885
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,069
cryptography
and she

886
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
and she
 

887
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,430
and she
she she did the implementation of um

888
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
she she did the implementation of um
 

889
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,910
she she did the implementation of um
bls signatures for the new consensus

890
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
bls signatures for the new consensus
 

891
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,230
bls signatures for the new consensus
this work is finished um it's already

892
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,240
this work is finished um it's already
 

893
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,790
this work is finished um it's already
delivered it's in the node already

894
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
delivered it's in the node already
 

895
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,030
delivered it's in the node already
so it's integrated actually the node now

896
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
so it's integrated actually the node now
 

897
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,509
so it's integrated actually the node now
can accept and and verify bls signatures

898
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:29,519
can accept and and verify bls signatures
 

899
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,590
can accept and and verify bls signatures
so by the way this is of course part of

900
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
so by the way this is of course part of
 

901
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,350
so by the way this is of course part of
the consensus implementation and it's

902
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
the consensus implementation and it's
 

903
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,870
the consensus implementation and it's
already delivered

904
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
already delivered
 

905
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,710
already delivered
um so she now moved to work chain uh

906
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
um so she now moved to work chain uh
 

907
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,629
um so she now moved to work chain uh
about a month ago and she's doing the

908
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:40,639
about a month ago and she's doing the
 

909
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,230
about a month ago and she's doing the
modeling now

910
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240
modeling now
 

911
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,990
modeling now
first she did the research on the

912
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
first she did the research on the
 

913
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,310
first she did the research on the
consensus on the on the drive chain that

914
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:46,320
consensus on the on the drive chain that
 

915
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,110
consensus on the on the drive chain that
you know

916
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,120
you know
 

917
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,430
you know
i have uh you know the design and now

918
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,440
i have uh you know the design and now
 

919
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,870
i have uh you know the design and now
she she

920
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:50,880
she she
 

921
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,110
she she
verified the design did some research on

922
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,120
verified the design did some research on
 

923
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,230
verified the design did some research on
the design

924
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,240
the design
 

925
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,870
the design
of the different uh you know

926
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:56,880
of the different uh you know
 

927
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,189
of the different uh you know
storage mechanisms

928
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
storage mechanisms
 

929
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,189
storage mechanisms
he kind of finalized the the basically

930
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199
he kind of finalized the the basically
 

931
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,590
he kind of finalized the the basically
conceptual design with all the

932
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:03,600
conceptual design with all the
 

933
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,710
conceptual design with all the
security

934
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:04,720
security
 

935
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,270
security
like models guarantees and so on and now

936
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
like models guarantees and so on and now
 

937
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,510
like models guarantees and so on and now
now she's she's doing modeling in python

938
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:09,520
now she's she's doing modeling in python
 

939
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,270
now she's she's doing modeling in python
so there will be a drive chain

940
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,280
so there will be a drive chain
 

941
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,590
so there will be a drive chain
implementation on titan first where we

942
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
implementation on titan first where we
 

943
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,350
implementation on titan first where we
can like that was exactly like we did

944
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
can like that was exactly like we did
 

945
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,549
can like that was exactly like we did
with consensus we have a model of design

946
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
with consensus we have a model of design
 

947
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,990
with consensus we have a model of design
for consensus algorithm actually in

948
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,000
for consensus algorithm actually in
 

949
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,069
for consensus algorithm actually in
python so now we will have the drive

950
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,079
python so now we will have the drive
 

951
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,230
python so now we will have the drive
chain implementation button and uh from

952
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
chain implementation button and uh from
 

953
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,390
chain implementation button and uh from
that point we will just uh you know once

954
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
that point we will just uh you know once
 

955
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,789
that point we will just uh you know once
we tested everything and uh

956
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:28,799
we tested everything and uh
 

957
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,029
we tested everything and uh
yeah and so on then we will just move it

958
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:31,039
yeah and so on then we will just move it
 

959
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,470
yeah and so on then we will just move it
to rust

960
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
to rust
 

961
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,630
to rust
does it include the networking glare or

962
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
does it include the networking glare or
 

963
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,789
does it include the networking glare or
is it just a local model no no it's

964
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:36,799
is it just a local model no no it's
 

965
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,190
is it just a local model no no it's
local model it doesn't need to include

966
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,200
local model it doesn't need to include
 

967
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,350
local model it doesn't need to include
it has some variables like delays and

968
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360
it has some variables like delays and
 

969
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,830
it has some variables like delays and
the load backflows so you can emulate

970
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:43,840
the load backflows so you can emulate
 

971
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,110
the load backflows so you can emulate
the network but it's just an emulator

972
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,120
the network but it's just an emulator
 

973
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,110
the network but it's just an emulator
but but it's it's uh it's important kind

974
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,120
but but it's it's uh it's important kind
 

975
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,990
but but it's it's uh it's important kind
of for for all sorts of uh things yeah

976
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
of for for all sorts of uh things yeah
 

977
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,909
of for for all sorts of uh things yeah
sure sure everything starts with

978
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
sure sure everything starts with
 

979
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,310
sure sure everything starts with

maybe let's let's proceed i think we

984
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:00,880
maybe let's let's proceed i think we
 

985
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,270
maybe let's let's proceed i think we
should uh move on though because we have

986
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
should uh move on though because we have
 

987
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,590
should uh move on though because we have
other presentations to take care of and

988
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
other presentations to take care of and
 

989
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,950
other presentations to take care of and
we want to make sure that we can squeeze

990
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960
we want to make sure that we can squeeze
 

991
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,430
we want to make sure that we can squeeze
them in too but michael thank you very

00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,520
much you mentioned that you didn't have
 

995
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,430
much you mentioned that you didn't have
that much of an update to do but it

996
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440
that much of an update to do but it
 

997
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,470
that much of an update to do but it
sounds like

is not too too old i think
 

1763
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,710
is not too too old i think
if it's

1764
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:50,720
if it's
 

1765
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,110
if it's
five years old that's fine

1766

five years old that's fine
 

1767
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,750

but if it six or seven i think it will
 

1769
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,789

what is every start ever start is a

1894
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:23,280
what is every start ever start is a
 

1895
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,349
what is every start ever start is a
decentralized launch part based on our

1896
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:25,359
decentralized launch part based on our
 

1897
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,750
decentralized launch part based on our
scale how does it work for example the

1898
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:27,760
scale how does it work for example the
 

1899
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,829
scale how does it work for example the
project wants to launch its token on

1900
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:29,839
project wants to launch its token on
 

1901
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,430
project wants to launch its token on
everstart

everstart
 

1903
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,510
everstart
so there was a queue token sale on the

1904
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:33,520
so there was a queue token sale on the
 

1905
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,589
so there was a queue token sale on the
platform the project puts tokens for

1906
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:35,599
platform the project puts tokens for
 

1907
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,310
platform the project puts tokens for
sale and indicates the currency for

1908
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:38,320
sale and indicates the currency for
 

1909
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,470
sale and indicates the currency for
which this tokens will be sold in this

1910
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:40,480
which this tokens will be sold in this
 

1911
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,670
which this tokens will be sold in this
case for example cubes were sold forever

1912
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:43,680
case for example cubes were sold forever
 

1913
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,910
case for example cubes were sold forever
the project also indicates the minimum

1914

the project also indicates the minimum
 

1915
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,470
the project also indicates the minimum
required amount to start a project it's

1916
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:48,480
required amount to start a project it's
 

1917
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,349
required amount to start a project it's
soft cap for example if the project

1918
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:51,359
soft cap for example if the project
 

1919
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,230
soft cap for example if the project
didn't

1920
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:52,240
didn't
 

1921
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,430

collect
the minimum

1924
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:54,800
the minimum
 

1925
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,630
the minimum

every start there is also a hard cap

1930
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:01,599
every start there is also a hard cap
 

1931
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,990
every start there is also a hard cap
it's the maximum amount of money raised

1932
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:04,000
it's the maximum amount of money raised
 

1933
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,069
it's the maximum amount of money raised
so for example if the hard cap is

1934
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:06,079
so for example if the hard cap is
 

1935
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,910
so for example if the hard cap is
exceeded then some of the money is

1936
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:07,920
exceeded then some of the money is
 

1937
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,150
exceeded then some of the money is

3333
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,349
um for the the rust cup thing is is
again is something that

3334
01:03:15,349 --> 01:03:15,359
again is something that
 

3335
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,589
again is something that
i proposed to do as an intermediary

3336
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:17,599
i proposed to do as an intermediary
 

3337
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,589
i proposed to do as an intermediary
solution but i i didn't say that i will

3338
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:21,599
solution but i i didn't say that i will
 

3339
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,710
solution but i i didn't say that i will
lead that

3340
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:22,720
lead that
 

3341
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,150
lead that
process

3342
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:24,160
process
 

3343
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,950
process
um to actually use them using them okay

3344
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:26,960
um to actually use them using them okay
 

3345
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,470
um to actually use them using them okay
so that's one thing

3346
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:28,480
so that's one thing
 

3347
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,589
so that's one thing
there for the uh for the

3348
01:03:31,589 --> 01:03:31,599
there for the uh for the
 

3349
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,309
there for the uh for the
um the elector itself because that's

3350
01:03:34,309 --> 01:03:34,319
um the elector itself because that's
 

3351
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:36,630
um the elector itself because that's
connected

3352
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:36,640
connected
 

3353
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,870
connected
the lecture is in

3354
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:38,880
the lecture is in
 

3355
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,950
the lecture is in
like the vector contracts

3356
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:40,960
like the vector contracts
 

3357
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,309
like the vector contracts
are

3358
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:42,319
are
 

3359
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,990
are
done

3360
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:44,000
done
 

3361
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,309
done
already a month ago

3362
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:46,319
already a month ago
 

3363
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:49,990
already a month ago
we're now implementing the node um

3364
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:50,000
we're now implementing the node um
 

3365
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,109
we're now implementing the node um
support for this and we have done

3366
01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:53,119
support for this and we have done
 

3367
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,190
support for this and we have done
almost everything

3368
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:55,200
almost everything
 

3369
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,349
almost everything
we now we came to the conclusion that

3370
01:03:57,349 --> 01:03:57,359
we now we came to the conclusion that
 

3371
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,029
we now we came to the conclusion that
the best thing to do they know well you

3372
01:03:59,029 --> 01:03:59,039
the best thing to do they know well you
 

3373
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,470
the best thing to do they know well you
start testing and then you realize

3374
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:00,480
start testing and then you realize
 

3375
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,990
start testing and then you realize
something that you can improve something

3376
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:02,000
something that you can improve something
 

3377
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,150
something that you can improve something
that need to improve something

3378
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:04,160
that need to improve something
 

3379
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,990
that need to improve something
so we came to the conclusion that we

3380
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:06,000
so we came to the conclusion that we
 

3381
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,950
so we came to the conclusion that we
need to add a special tvm instruction

3382
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:08,960
need to add a special tvm instruction
 

3383
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:13,029
need to add a special tvm instruction
that's the best actual way to to kind of

3384
01:04:13,029 --> 01:04:13,039
that's the best actual way to to kind of
 

3385
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:14,710
that's the best actual way to to kind of
implement the connection between the

3386
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:14,720
implement the connection between the
 

3387
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,829
implement the connection between the
node and the and the and the this

3388
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:17,839
node and the and the and the this
 

3389
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:19,670
node and the and the and the this
the electric process

3390
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:19,680
the electric process
 

3391
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,990
the electric process
so this instruction is in doing now and

3392
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:24,000
so this instruction is in doing now and
 

3393
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,950
so this instruction is in doing now and
so once this is finished we we basically

3394
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:26,960
so once this is finished we we basically
 

3395
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,990
so once this is finished we we basically
go to integrate integration testing

3396
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:30,000
go to integrate integration testing
 

3397
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,670
go to integrate integration testing
again integration testing uh will start

3398
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:33,680
again integration testing uh will start
 

3399
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,750
again integration testing uh will start
sometime in may we we will uh

3400
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:37,760
sometime in may we we will uh
 

3401
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,510
sometime in may we we will uh
we will put it on the network hopefully

3402
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:39,520
we will put it on the network hopefully
 

3403
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,829
we will put it on the network hopefully
on mate and

3404
01:04:41,829 --> 01:04:41,839
on mate and
 

3405
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:42,870
on mate and
again

3406
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:42,880
again
 

3407
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,270
again
and um you know a lot of things happen

3408
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:45,280
and um you know a lot of things happen
 

3409
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,150
and um you know a lot of things happen
in the maintenance so it's uh

3410
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:48,160
in the maintenance so it's uh
 

3411
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,549
in the maintenance so it's uh
probably there is a reason for that but

3412
01:04:50,549 --> 01:04:50,559
probably there is a reason for that but
 

3413
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:51,589
probably there is a reason for that but
i'm not sure

3414
01:04:51,589 --> 01:04:51,599
i'm not sure
 

3415
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,910
i'm not sure
but anyway on may 10th where we're kind

3416
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:53,920
but anyway on may 10th where we're kind
 

3417
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,750
but anyway on may 10th where we're kind
of

3418
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:55,760
of
 

3419
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,510
of
hope to see

3420
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:57,520
hope to see
 

3421
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,309
hope to see
this in some network and then after

3422
01:05:00,309 --> 01:05:00,319
this in some network and then after
 

3423
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:01,990
this in some network and then after
testing it will

3424
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:02,000
testing it will
 

3425
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,069
testing it will
find its way to

3426
01:05:04,069 --> 01:05:04,079
find its way to
 

3427
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:05,029
find its way to
uh

3428
01:05:05,029 --> 01:05:05,039
uh
 

3429
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:05,910
uh
to the

3430
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:05,920
to the
 

3431
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,470
to the
to the ever scale main net and then you

3432
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:08,480
to the ever scale main net and then you
 

3433
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,190
to the ever scale main net and then you
can

3434
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:09,200
can
 

3435
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,950
can
do whatever you want for that again

3436
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:10,960
do whatever you want for that again
 

3437
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,309
do whatever you want for that again
maybe

3438
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:12,319
maybe
 

3439
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:13,710
maybe
you want to do rust tools

3440
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:13,720
you want to do rust tools
 

3441
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,750
you want to do rust tools
[Music]

3442
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:15,760
[Music]
 

3443
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,309
[Music]
but and i didn't realize that all the

3444
01:05:18,309 --> 01:05:18,319
but and i didn't realize that all the
 

3445
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,829
but and i didn't realize that all the
current dipoles will be

3446
01:05:20,829 --> 01:05:20,839
current dipoles will be
 

3447
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:23,670
current dipoles will be
closed all the current deals

3448
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:23,680
closed all the current deals
 

3449
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,670
closed all the current deals
should be closed in order to transfer

3450
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:25,680
should be closed in order to transfer
 

3451
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,950
should be closed in order to transfer
the network to the electoral contracts

3452
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:28,960
the network to the electoral contracts
 

3453
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,549
the network to the electoral contracts
so

3454
01:05:30,549 --> 01:05:30,559
so
 

3455
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,950
so
that is not an easy thing to do

3456
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:32,960
that is not an easy thing to do
 

3457
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,470
that is not an easy thing to do
not in terms of coordination not in

3458
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:34,480
not in terms of coordination not in
 

3459
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,710
not in terms of coordination not in
terms of security not in terms of like

3460
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:36,720
terms of security not in terms of like
 

3461
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,390
terms of security not in terms of like
it's it's a huge

3462
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:38,400
it's it's a huge
 

3463
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,589
it's it's a huge
kind of

3464
01:05:39,589 --> 01:05:39,599
kind of
 

3465
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:41,190
kind of
well upgrade

3466
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:41,200
well upgrade
 

3467
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,309
well upgrade
so

3468
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:42,319
so
 

3469
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,309
so
this when you talk about huge upgrades

3470
01:05:44,309 --> 01:05:44,319
this when you talk about huge upgrades
 

3471
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:47,349
this when you talk about huge upgrades
you never talk about precise timing

3472
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:47,359
you never talk about precise timing
 

3473
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,430
you never talk about precise timing
because it's just

3474
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:49,440
because it's just
 

3475
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,589
because it's just
you know just impossible to know

3476
01:05:53,589 --> 01:05:53,599

 

3477
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:56,390

so is july the best

3478
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:56,400
so is july the best
 

3479
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,029
so is july the best
i don't know i mean it's uh again

3480
01:05:59,029 --> 01:05:59,039
i don't know i mean it's uh again
 

3481
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,750
i don't know i mean it's uh again
this is not up to me and i can deliver

3482
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:01,760
this is not up to me and i can deliver
 

3483
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,150
this is not up to me and i can deliver
the solution but i cannot speed up

3484
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:04,160
the solution but i cannot speed up
 

3485
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,549
the solution but i cannot speed up
processes around the delivery of the

3486
01:06:06,549 --> 01:06:06,559
processes around the delivery of the
 

3487
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:09,270
processes around the delivery of the
code around the uh testing like formal

3488
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:09,280
code around the uh testing like formal
 

3489
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,789
code around the uh testing like formal
verification for example of the code and

3490
01:06:10,789 --> 01:06:10,799
verification for example of the code and
 

3491
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:14,150
verification for example of the code and
stuff like that so it's a lot of um

3492
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:14,160
stuff like that so it's a lot of um
 

3493
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,230
stuff like that so it's a lot of um
it's actually my question the good thing

3494
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:16,240
it's actually my question the good thing
 

3495
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,230
it's actually my question the good thing
about that is that the contract itself

3496
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:18,240
about that is that the contract itself
 

3497
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,910
about that is that the contract itself
is actually easier

3498
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:19,920
is actually easier
 

3499
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,870
is actually easier
it's simpler than the depool and elector

3500
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:22,880
it's simpler than the depool and elector
 

3501
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,270
it's simpler than the depool and elector
contract it's much simpler than that so

3502
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:25,280
contract it's much simpler than that so
 

3503
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,029
contract it's much simpler than that so
in that respect it's much easier to

3504
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:27,039
in that respect it's much easier to
 

3505
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,029
in that respect it's much easier to
verify much easier to validate much

3506
01:06:29,029 --> 01:06:29,039
verify much easier to validate much
 

3507
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:32,069
verify much easier to validate much
easier to kind of audit and stuff so

3508
01:06:32,069 --> 01:06:32,079
easier to kind of audit and stuff so
 

3509
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,390
easier to kind of audit and stuff so
that's why i'm kind of optimistic that

3510
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:34,400
that's why i'm kind of optimistic that
 

3511
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,309
that's why i'm kind of optimistic that
it won't take too long after we test the

3512
01:06:36,309 --> 01:06:36,319
it won't take too long after we test the
 

3513
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:37,750
it won't take too long after we test the
solution on the integration of the

3514
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:37,760
solution on the integration of the
 

3515
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,029
solution on the integration of the
network

3516
01:06:39,029 --> 01:06:39,039
network
 

3517
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:41,430
network
but i may be wrong

3518
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:41,440
but i may be wrong

do you want less
 

3539
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:07,190

less huge upgrades
 

3541
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,349

i don't know i can do that it's easy

3542
01:07:09,349 --> 01:07:09,359
i don't know i can do that it's easy
 

3543
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,870
i don't know i can do that it's easy
yeah they can predict more i think

3544
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:10,880
yeah they can predict more i think
 

3545
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,430
yeah they can predict more i think
precisely i think i think that's a group

3546
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:13,440
precisely i think i think that's a group
 

3547
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,430
precisely i think i think that's a group
of people called validators in every

3548
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:15,440
of people called validators in every
 

3549
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,230
of people called validators in every
scale wants to have sort of a road map

3550
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:18,240
scale wants to have sort of a road map
 

3551
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,990
scale wants to have sort of a road map
and due to whatever reason

3552
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:20,000
and due to whatever reason
 

3553
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,829
and due to whatever reason
there is a road map i mean there's a

3554
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:21,839
there is a road map i mean there's a
 

3555
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:24,950
there is a road map i mean there's a
road map watching those questions

3556
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:24,960
road map watching those questions
 

3557
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,270
road map watching those questions
i think that i think that's roadmap

3558
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:27,280
i think that i think that's roadmap
 

3559
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,510
i think that i think that's roadmap
should be published or whatever because

3560
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:29,520
should be published or whatever because
 

3561
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,390
should be published or whatever because
again

3562
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:30,400
again
 

3563
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,390
again
there is a number of people a group of

3564
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:32,400
there is a number of people a group of
 

3565
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,789
there is a number of people a group of
people which are called validators which

3566
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:34,799
people which are called validators which
 

3567
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:36,069
people which are called validators which
are like you know

3568
01:07:36,069 --> 01:07:36,079
are like you know
 

3569
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,309
are like you know
the basis of the network and i think

3570
01:07:38,309 --> 01:07:38,319
the basis of the network and i think
 

3571
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:39,829
the basis of the network and i think
that there is some lack of

3572
01:07:39,829 --> 01:07:39,839
that there is some lack of
 

3573
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:41,829
that there is some lack of
communications with that group of people

3574
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:41,839
communications with that group of people
 

3575
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:43,829
communications with that group of people
and again on voicing that's why we have

3576

mean you we have a road map which is

3592
01:07:58,710 --> 01:07:58,720
mean you we have a road map which is
 

3593
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,549
mean you we have a road map which is
published by the network

3594
01:08:00,549 --> 01:08:00,559
published by the network
 

3595
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,029
published by the network
you know there is a roadmap for you you

3596
01:08:03,029 --> 01:08:03,039
you know there is a roadmap for you you
 

3597
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:07,190
you know there is a roadmap for you you
can always refer to this roadmap

3598
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:07,200

 

3599
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,190

i'm not giving any more roadmaps i mean

3600
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:09,200
i'm not giving any more roadmaps i mean
 

3601
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,470
i'm not giving any more roadmaps i mean

fingers how many huge projects
i just mentioned in terms of like

3632
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:41,440
i just mentioned in terms of like
 

3633
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:44,309
i just mentioned in terms of like
structural network products that usually

3634
01:08:44,309 --> 01:08:44,319
structural network products that usually
 

3635
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:47,269
structural network products that usually
take for other networks years to do

3636
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:47,279
take for other networks years to do
 

3637
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:49,829
take for other networks years to do
years to do with much larger budget and

3638
01:08:49,829 --> 01:08:49,839
years to do with much larger budget and
 

3639
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:51,990
years to do with much larger budget and
we are way more developers than we have

3640
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:52,000
we are way more developers than we have
 

3641
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,309

just count
 

3645
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,390
just count
just in that course there is a number

3646
01:08:58,390 --> 01:08:58,400
just in that course there is a number
 

3647
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,070
just in that course there is a number
but this this this is not the question

3648
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:00,080
but this this this is not the question
 

3649

when is that starting thinking about
 

3843
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,470
when is that starting thinking about
opening ever foundation question mark

3844
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:50,480
opening ever foundation question mark
 

3845
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,270
opening ever foundation question mark
why

3846
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:51,280
why
 

3847
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,950
why
don't open ever foundation

3848

so asking about the ever foundation the
 

3851
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,030
so asking about the ever foundation the
foundation that uh

everscale foundation from the i would

3916
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:08,800
everscale foundation from the i would
 

3917
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,510
everscale foundation from the i would
say active reputable members

3918
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:11,520
say active reputable members
 

3919
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,870
say active reputable members
but i would probably stop it there and

3920
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:14,880
but i would probably stop it there and
 

3921
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,550
but i would probably stop it there and
i will present it properly once it's

3922
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:16,560
i will present it properly once it's
 

3923
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,630
i will present it properly once it's
launched just before its launch

3924
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:18,640
launched just before its launch
 

3925
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,590
launched just before its launch
but

3926
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:19,600
but
 

3927
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,830
but
i gave you the idea timing wise

3928
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:21,840
i gave you the idea timing wise
 

3929
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,189
i gave you the idea timing wise
let's give it a couple of more months

3930
01:14:23,189 --> 01:14:23,199
let's give it a couple of more months
 

3931
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:25,990
let's give it a couple of more months
maybe realistically speaking

3932
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:26,000
maybe realistically speaking
 

3933
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,950
maybe realistically speaking
so not so soon but relatively soon

3934
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:28,960
so not so soon but relatively soon
 

3935
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,390
so not so soon but relatively soon
is the answer

3936
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:30,400
is the answer
 

3937

never is a is a currency collection coin

3980
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:20,320
never is a is a currency collection coin
 

3981
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:21,910
never is a is a currency collection coin
so we did

3982
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:21,920
so we did
 

3983
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,270
so we did
and we did start in special network

3984
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:25,280
and we did start in special network
 

3985
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,430
and we did start in special network
where currency collection coin is

3986
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:27,440
where currency collection coin is
 

3987
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,950
where currency collection coin is
presented

3988
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:28,960
presented
 

3989
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,550
presented
um so people can debug on that network

3990
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:32,560
um so people can debug on that network
 

3991
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,630
um so people can debug on that network
uh their solution

3992
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:34,640
uh their solution
 

3993
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,590
uh their solution
and

3994
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:35,600
and
 

3995
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,030
and
the only team who asked us to do that
