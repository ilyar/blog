let's see
and
i think
just two more people
foreign
okay wait one more minute
okay i'm not sure if the other guys are
going to join
oh anywho okay
so let's
then begin
okay welcome everybody good morning good
afternoon good evening wherever you are
in the world it's tuesday the 24th of
may it's the 105th weekly meet and we
have an interesting lineup today for you
from
some regional news to
contests yay
and last week every scale was listed on
bitmart and they're launching a trading
competition the campaign includes giving
away thousands of everest and will
end on the 31st of this month so go get
your bags
and everscale is also going to be a gold
sponsor
at the capital 2022 it's a global
conference held by coin market cap uh
being held on the 26th to the 27th of
may
also this month
and a cheng pen cz will be speaking
michael saylor and our own nikita
inchikov and michael gourd will also be
taking part in the conference as
speakers
boosting awareness of the everscale
network and of course networking
uh there has been quite a heated
discussion going on in the chats and
that is
the dune topic
dune swap
so first and foremost we have a really
big community there are thousands of
people and not everybody is going to be
happy with every single decision made
but with that said
everdao while having been announced in
the past was never really heavily
marketed within the community
and
we've seen that community members are
still also posting on the forum
which is not really
it's kind of absolute absolute by now
so please be aware that everdao is now
the go-to resource
everdao is
basically the base platform for all
proposals if you want to know what's
going on
please check there regularly
and
[Music]
for months the dune community members
have been asking about the status of the
swap
and it has been crickets
yeah i can't say how many
if any were really aware of the
assessments that had happened over the
past month
but
all of the partnerships were up for a
reassessment
even the initial numbers
they were also up for assessment as well
um and everybody everything went to a
vote on everdao and it's still going on
in three phases
um
but the one that
you should have really been aware of
went under the radar unfortunately
probably because this year number of
proposals that had gone through
there should have been more awareness
raised for this specific topic being
doomed
um
now
please know that it's up to every
individual who considers themself a
community member to please take interest
and go and review the proposals
now that you are aware of it i
understand that
itself
can be an issue when you need tokens to
vote
which is the
exact thing that you're waiting for i
understand
and
that might
end up being a case
of looking to the community for support
we saw that
vladimir ceo of broxas pointed out
earlier in the community chat that the
continuation of the partnership with
dune is going to be put up for
a vote in um one day
and that's the proposal number 60 if you
want to go check it out on everdao.net
and look for that one
if
if it does um vladislav yeah sorry
vladis vladislav um
if it gets accepted they will continue
funding the merger
but otherwise
if it doesn't the rest of the money will
go back to the treasury
so
um be sure to
have a look you know about this time you
have a chance to know what's going on
you have a chance to have a voice
there is a spot for discussion and
comments
below every proposal at the bottom of
the page
and
to the dune community specifically
that was proposal number 52. you have to
go look at it read it over think about
it
maybe there's an argument
to open up
to redo the vote because basically none
of the community was aware that had gone
up so it's a chance to voice your site
so go check it out and have a discussion
so let's see yes ron you have a hand up
um yeah hi let me um also put it down um
so
uh right if i may i'm just gonna make uh
just a few small uh
corrections so
the first thing is is there was an
announcement made
it was made the minute that the growth
phase 3 partnership was up for a vote
all of that was described in it it was
put in all the chats
i'm happy to search and find where that
is and then maybe we can you know just
uh
reintroduce everybody
sort of jog their memory that this was
done
um so it really was no surprise i
understand that not everybody can
monitor every announcement that's made
but unfortunately that's you know
we're limited in the amount of time that
we can spend making announcements for
any one particular thing the second
thing is that uh
we can't um isolate certain partners
there there were close to 40 of them uh
and it's also important to underscore
that it was like you said it wasn't just
partners it was also initial members
uh so the
um
there's no re i mean unless we're going
to put 70
individual announcements for each
partner initial number
it it doesn't work that way so it's
everybody's responsibility to have come
looked um and paid attention um and i
don't want to say that in a in a mean
way uh right i understand that we're all
human and you know we've got other
things that we're doing but the fact of
the matter is
um this was announced
um there it didn't come out of the blue
uh it was everybody's responsibility to
go to uber dow
and monitor what was going on um but uh
yeah i just wanted to make those two
quick statements um as far if we're
going to just talk about dune
um which i i'd rather not because
dune is not the only partner that um uh
was being assessed
but because it's been brought up and of
course i've seen the chats and i know
that um there are some angry people
there um the thing is this right so
uh the
i i don't think um that there's that
it's a
legitimate to just go and do the vote
again right because then that sets a
precedent that every time there's a vote
there could be 25 more after that you
know and then it just fuels the fire of
debate and discussion that isn't healthy
but
you know
if if you did have something to say or
if you wanted to
uh
you know support your own claim to not
be dismissed then you should have done
so you know that like i said the
announcements were there um you could
have come you could have said something
uh at the same time um i do understand
why um a lot of people
um are gonna be upset but the reality is
that we also
are voting for things that either do or
do not have value
and if for whatever reason the majority
of the voters felt that it wasn't it's
just you know it's one of those things
uh so
i just want everybody to keep a cool
head and not you know take it out of
proportion um yelling and screaming at
one another isn't going to help things
at all the vote passed that's what it is
uh one more correction um the vote uh
for dune that's up
right now is not for the do network as a
partner that's for the initial member
dune slash
um what is called uh uh
open open labs
olabs olaf origin labs right that
is
separate uh the one for the partnership
which i believe is partnership number 52
proposal number 52 that has already
passed and the vote is completed so
the outcome is unfortunately the outcome
so and if you have questions you're
certainly welcome to raise them i hope i
sort of clarified a few things
okay thank you um
for any dune community members who are
watching uh please be aware that
you know you don't go unheard people do
care and want to help
mediate in some way find some sort of
ground if you don't feel heard
but i think we
don't have all the facts together at
this point and should probably
move on from here
and with that um
i'd like to bring in our wonderful media
with our tech updates if you're ready
yeah
i am
i think
hi oh so um
last week was obviously
a very kind of intense one because
the network almost stopped well it
stopped sometime and then we had the
sunset incident that
the validators because because
not only the network stalled for a few
minutes but it's also
some shards also stalled
and that prevented
um
some
um
not some but all the bulls basically
it created a situation where where
i don't want to go into the details
but
um because of some time
uh
incompatibility
between
the new election time and what was in
the
kind of
configuration smart contracts the
dipoles could not
uh could not join the elections and that
left the network working with the
previous set of validators and in order
to resolve this situation well it's very
it's quite simple it's just that
validators had to
submit their stakes directly which some
of them did
and the network for one
cycle
has been
the number of value this has been
reduced a very small number
basically which is which is kind of
normal in terms of that is expected but
of course it's not normal in terms of
how networks should have been configured
um but again
a reminder that
the network was configured very long
time ago based on configs that
was developed by
you know in the
world old very old configs developed for
a very old network
but we're still using them um
and
part of this reason we're using them is
because it's the the delector smart
contracts are still not uh operational
so anyway um
we fixed everything
basically we fixed the problem with the
network fixed problem with shards
and uh and uh
we
it what the the only the good thing
is that suddenly everyone
uh has upgraded their notes
puree
like
hallelujah
um
so
if we need to stop the network every
time for you know the validators to
upgrade their notes
um we will do that
no problem
it's a deal
let's do that
i hope you like it guys
well anyway um
jokes aside but seriously
um
like parts of the reason not the parts
but the entire reason why the networks
told in the first place
was because of some smart contracts
that executed some
uh
something that was fixed already is
fixed already for months we just cannot
upgrade
the bloody network in time
so
in a way it's like a vicious cycle which
which is which is um
[Music]
came to an end
or at least one of the cycles that came
to an end
because of this
the network stall so
it's crazy a little bit nevertheless
we have an upgrade
to the network
going out
today
this upgrade
also unfortunately need to be rolled out
slowly
because
in harsh conditions when the network
stopped we did release the upgrade but
we didn't release the upgrade with the
like we didn't ask everyone to fix
because
then for sure the network would stop
completely
so we didn't ask everyone to repair the
database
so because of that
we don't know actually the real number
of repair database currently on the
network and as such we cannot rely just
we cannot just release an upgrade we
need to be extra cautious
i'm not taking i'm not taking this risk
that the network will stop for like two
hours if
if the
the number of nodes that with the
repaired database
is not sufficient
therefore
we did some some
some changes
the the current upgrade that is going to
be released today
is going to
mandatorily like
uh fix the
fix the database
or run the fix anyway if your database
is fixed then it shouldn't take more
than a few minutes
if it's not then it can take up to two
hours so the upgrade will be
rolling out today slowly
again with the same procedure basically
you ask
you ask the telegram contact contacts
that
um
that we will be part of the upgrade
announcement and you go there and you
ask them for
like
release notes and and uh
and where like how to upgrade
instructions
and that's um and then you upgrade your
node
a wait if the database need to be
repaired
whatever it takes one hour two hours
sometimes even three hours but that's
what it is and uh and that's it um
once you're done we your note is
operational we will see the new version
of the blogs coming out and
then we know that the database has been
repaired
we are thinking about
how to
prevent the situations of
non-upgrade nodes and there are some
ideas that we are entertaining right now
including the idea of the validator
would not be able to
submit their notes to the elections
if the notice were not running
the mandatory update software
so
this is still in discussion
but
there's something that needs to be done
um
we're not
we're not a bitcoin network where you
can take your time and upgrade and half
a year
like
we are much more
dynamically developed network
with may way more updates
um with may way more changes
and in general just more demanding in
terms of the
you know the software and everything
and the operations exactly as well so um
so therefore we
we cannot allow
the validators just sit on upgrade and
you know not doing anything um basically
not operating their nodes
and so on you cannot be lazy validator
or or you should be punished for that i
mean you should not be allowed to be
validator like that
again it's a it's not just a
some kind of
token mining exercise or minting
exercise
it's maintaining
the fastest the most scalable
computing network in the world
and that does require and you paid for
that that does require
uh
technical capabilities from the
validators
and that's why we had all this
you know
months
of of testing months of um
different contests and so on for that
so so you know
that's it and and uh
of course i understand that like you can
say oh but you know rast cup where where
is the last cup
um
rewards and so on and so forth
you're still paid for this
it's not a free work
and and the payment is quite nice
actually
and the fact that you didn't need to
come up with all the money particularly
those who who participated in the last
contests
is just it's just uh um
you know i think it's enough incentive
not only to validate
because not nobody's asking to validate
like it's you're paid for it right
um
but also to do it correctly and uh
and you know
technically
[Music]
like answering all the technical
requirements that
that the validator should follow
so
um
yeah that's that's it from me i think
okay thank you very much misha that's
great news that everybody finally
updated all their nodes you can finally
move on onwards and upwards
um
next up on the agenda is uh i think we
have just a few minutes i left from
uh dennis he's still with us and we have
a brief update about the chinese
community and dennis is here to share
with us
a few words dennis
hey guys
yes sure we'll be happy to share some
progress on the chinese community as
well happy to
see everybody
i'm not sure if nico is with us
okay i think nico is not with us but
anyway uh just a very quick update um
we've
so as you remember
we've uh
basically uh had our proposal passed
two months ago i think
uh
for ramping up marketing and the brand
awareness in china for everscale
so uh we're currently continuing to do
it i think that with uh
uh with our uh
proposal with our funding we can uh
carry on even longer than two two months
basically
uh we've made several amas
for in partnership with the chinese tier
one crypto medias
and
we've made some
uh
training uh webinars for developers uh
in china in chinese so basically you can
take a look at them
we have a video with a
pretty instructive and detailed
explanation how to use
ever wallet how to use octus bridge
etc in everything in chinese so they got
pretty popular
and recently we've also started to uh
push
a little bit harder on marketing
uh basically nico is the one who was in
charge of uh our marketing activities uh
and uh
uh basically we've partnered with some
agents who uh
helped us get additional traffic on uh
onto our telegram group in
a
telegram
group
for china so now we have around
8 000 users there and basically i think
the biggest
progress that we had
and that we've also kind of highlighted
on in our proposal that we wanted to
revive our community make it more active
so now
it's
pretty active indeed you can see that
there are a lot of users uh speaking to
each other exchanging news about
well of course about talking
because most of them are still kind of
crypto guys
uh we haven't really here hearing it
like we uh because uh
the key audience for us is still kind of
crypto traders this is kind of the
beginning uh that we have the strategy
that first we target crypto
people
make make them
more active and then we will
target developers so
basically we are currently implementing
this strategy
and
yes so a lot of people in our telegram
uh group
uh
of course there are some kind of uh
complaints that perhaps some of them are
bots or maybe some of them not that
active
well we're doing our best to reduce
number of bots and to make sure that
those are
uh kind of live people who are active
and
the most
important thing is that we
do our best to ensure that
uh all the people who are coming through
these channels through this
traffic
they
remain active and we engage them by
by trading contests for example
currently we have
more than
20 people already participating in this
contest so we will distribute some
rewards to
uh
the top
10 active traders for chinese community
only this will encourage more and more
people
by ever and actually hold ever
and
be more active and more interested in
the development of the of the project
we also plan to do more amaze and
sooner or later identify potential
developers who will
be interested not only in token but also
in the technology as well because china
there are many developers so this is
kind of a pretty long process that we're
currently
working on
so in general yeah
just very quick update uh if you have
any questions would be happy to answer
right now or maybe afterwards in
telegram you can just send me a message
okay um if anybody has any questions you
should jump in now any questions for
dennis um because i know he has to jump
off in a minute i don't see any hands
going up um but
thank you for the very quick update and
i see that what you have been doing in
the chinese everscale community has been
a successful marketing and growth
strategy
plan because
the community is actually the largest
national community in every scale so
congratulations on that
thank you thank you we we're doing our
best
you should have an award for that
but uh looking forward to
even better results
and maybe some
stats or date or some data next time
when you have more time
yeah
a detailed report on this so yeah i
could be happy to share it cool
okay okay
okay i i need to disconnect guys sorry
bye dennis see ya bye
cool okay moving on to the next point in
our agenda
is very exciting great topic it's the
never stable coin contest
never is a system of stable coin
auctions based on the white paper by our
very own mitcha and we have anzor dora
from the radiance team and the radiance
team is a group of developers who have
been creating projects products for
everscale for over two years now which
is great they are dedicated team and we
have them here
to give a very cool
interactive presentation
so hello everyone my name is anzor uh
can you hear me well yes i can hear you

implementation is based on uh media's uh
white paper on uh never the stable coin
and uh we're gonna have a game and an
auction game basically so um
i would love if uh people from the
from the zoom and youtube would
participate the only thing you need is
to go to this uh website i've posted in
the
youtube chat as well as
zoom chat
so you have to go there and you'll you
also have to have
ever wallet
and um ever wallet switched to test net
so please everyone who wants to
participate and play it's really easy
we'll just uh have some bets on the um
on the uh
uh
never
auction and uh
before that uh
you can send me your um
oh yeah thank you roman uh for the right
link
so uh before that you you probably need
to send me your
wallet so that i can send you some test
net tokens so that we can play
so whoever wants to play with us
send your address in youtube or zoom
chat
join you can play too
meter complete as well unfortunately we
don't have the um
the surf implementation yet for this so
it's it's not available through d-bots
but this is for future for now it's uh
working with the inside the ever wallet
just uh while we're waiting for wallace
just hold on one sec
okay send your wallet address to enzor
or anybody
in the zoom chat now you could just post
it here
yeah if we if we'll have enough people
from chat we'll play with people from
chat but
in case nobody wants to play which would
be sad of course but we can demonstrate
with the
uh
with our team i have some teammates here
who can uh play with me and help me
make the double yep there's one
okay
one bullet in zoom chat i think i
believe right okay uh oh okay
oh rahman wants to play well cool
so um
okay
so um yeah it's a um we have a front-end
interface which i'm showing right now
which i'm going to show more extensively
during the demo
and uh there's also
it's it only covers the
the big auctions
we don't have the
d auction with the small auctions like
the retail auctions uh implementation
for uh
uh oh rahman actually deleted his uh
all his address
now that was me no no
oh that was wrong sorry yeah and i don't
know i i just copied into youtube i made
a mistake so just oh okay okay okay
um
okay
ron's trying to tell everybody send me
money here's my wallet
it'd be a different wallet
okay
you're gonna say that send a different
wallet
no no no i'm sorry just please continue
okay
yeah so
um yeah anyone else want to play
uh without the surf um implementation
it's a bit tricky i have to
go you don't have the ever wallet on a
different computer
oh i see i see yes same for me i i'd
love to join i
don't actually have access at the moment
okay okay yeah i see we have uh we have
to cover the part of our audience yeah
we have eugene
eugene sanders
oh
yeah by the way that's right
hello everybody i would love to play
azor
i'm a big fan of your teamwork but
unfortunately i'm in the airport taking
off all right what do you need to do a
conference i apologize for cool not
being able to help thank you we're a
really bad audience sorry
it's all right that's right
i am posting about it okay cool
uh
i will send you some test network
tokens right now
okay
so um
yeah of course you have to switch to
test nets right here and um
then we're ready to play
and um yeah so why we're um we're
possibly waiting for more wallets uh um
uh
ron
please let me know if there's any
wallets in youtube maybe people will
want to play
yeah uh thank you so i will create the
auction right now and uh
uh we'll see how it goes
anywhere
uh
yes i've posted the link in the in the
in both chats yeah
it's the interface
uh
in a few seconds you'll probably see
that the auction for nevers has
started
so this constant contest was uh finished
quite recently
i'm not sure if it's completely finished
because i think we don't have uh enough
votes this time sometimes it happens
the uh there's a lot of contests in uh
defy
subgovernance uh it's busy sub
governance producing a lot of solutions
for different things
and sometimes some companies don't get
enough votes so probably
i think it might be extended for the
voting period but
yeah nevertheless we wanted to share
with you
what what we have produced and uh
we think it's cool and we think you
might think it goes out oh the auction
has been created and um
yeah so uh if we view the option uh we
can see the current phase which is the
open phase and
we can see the current market price
timer
uh which means that well it's like the
the ever refreshing time ever refreshing
price
so we have the oracle price and we have
the minimum lot size which is the
minimum amount you can buy
and
so the
this
every participant has to has to offer a
price
for
for this auction
so uh
in here we should offer um
i'm gonna ask yaroslav to
who's uh my teammate uh
to help me out and tell me uh what
should be what should be the price
for the winner here
what is the definite
should it be the
4.5 right or 4.7
i think 4.7
okay yeah sure sure more than oracle
actually suggests so 4.7 or 4.8 or 4.9
however is um
is uh
whoever is playing with us now you can
enter your price it can be even more but
um
uh if you win
you're going to have the uh
you're going to to buy
navers for the second best price since
this is a
weekly option
so
i'm going to
suggest
i'm going to input 4.7
and
there is a salt generator right here
that allows you to sort of
conceal your bid
but still have info on your bid if you
have lost your info on
on your bt you can save this data using
this button right here to copy this data
but uh
i think right now everything works fine
so we don't need that so i'm going to
make a bit while it's still open
and
see how it goes everyone else please
make your beats as well
we should have had music for this
to make it more uh auction like you know
let's selfless
yeah ladies and gentlemen gentlemen
make your beds
okay i've made my bid
the next phase is going to be the
confirmation phase in roughly three
seconds
so uh
everyone will need to confirm their bids
i'm not sure if there's enough bids i i
hope media made it to to make
the beat in time
there wasn't too much time so right here
we can
we can set the amount over minimum lot
size that we want to buy so if you want
if we want to buy more than 2.5 nevers
we can
like say input three more and
we'll have 5.5 numbers to buy
uh
by the way this is uh like the dark
version of our interface which i like
more we also have the light one for
those who like to to develop their eyes
why do i need to save the data of the
option in case the front end fails
so
no need right now but it's just the
precaution for like
to to to make it less
dependent on the front end
yeah so um confirm b
and uh
then we send the transaction
and
we're confirming and we're waiting for
the next phase to start which is
i think the claim phase where we can
see who won the auction
and uh the winner and everyone else can
buy uh
the
more nevers later
uh using the uh the price that was
second
like the second best price
so my bit is confirmed
i can still save save my data and uh
i've already input the
amount over minimum lot size
and uh yeah we're just waiting for a
minute now uh if ever if anyone has um
any more questions we're happy to answer
but uh yeah generally it's it's like the
probably the first implementation of the
auctions uh
yeah i think the like the first
one of the one of the first
implementations of the of the options
right now i think we'll have the
improvement for this later
uh including the debug interface for uh
surf including the um the options
interface which is implemented in smart
contracts but will will also have it in
the interface for sort of like retail
auctions
uh for smaller amounts and um
yeah i think a few
more
improvements on the way as well
uh this works fine as it is right now
but yeah we'll have more features
and
yeah i just wanted to show you what uh
defy sub governance is up to recently i
hope that
you like it hope that
yo
i think we
had something in zoom chat oh norm
actually posted his uh
his wallet no i'm sorry we'll have your
uh we'll have your um
we didn't win we didn't either
okay i didn't win
you didn't did someone else did okay
someone else did uh i think
it was higher than yours and lower than
mine because i i had a 4.9 ever i bet my
bad
you had 400 oh okay so someone that
posted up upper than you i think
probably i see i see so your your price
i have one but the second price is has
has received
the bid
okay okay we can still buy more than
ever
still in this menu we can still buy more
numbers i'm going to buy two more
uh yeah have some more numbers uh nom
we're gonna um
we're gonna have you uh play with us for
the uh reverse option
uh
i will send you some never tokens for
you to participate so we're going to
have the like the never ever auction as
well
if we uh john do we have we still have a
little more time
yes you have a good time cool cool cool
so um
yeah
let's um
let's see uh
should i see should i see never seen the
in the yes but you have you probably
have to refresh the the interface to see
them i didn't send you the
the root address for the token so you
probably don't see it in the in your um
ever wallet but if you refresh the web
page you should probably see it in
in
i don't
i don't know okay maybe he's trying to
buy them but um
[Music]
you didn't receive any nevers
not not yet at least
okay yeah the it might be a little slow
i think i don't have them yet as well so
it might be a little slow
sometimes
okay uh norm i've sent you the never
tokens
i'm going to send you some ever testnet
tokens as well why the ever prices
listed for 998 right now for me
if the auction was won by someone below
4.9
well
there's somebody in youtube saying that
they won and they put five ever but they
could be you know smirking in the i
don't know if they're telling the truth
or not
hmm
oh yeah
somebody probably puts the
five evers right okay yeah this uh
joseph didn't actually send his
wallets he probably had or had his own
maybe someone put 499 something but but
why no it's very strange the resulting
price the second price is 4.9 ever at
listing i don't know in the interface
right
from the four bits that's right but it
sells for four point nine nine eight
uh
i can answer yeah yeah yeah if you can
please alexey um
yeah you can buy never
higher than second price uh by the
percent
um i see i see so it adds one percent on
top of the second best price uh if you
didn't win
two
two percent
to the second price
all right oh yeah right makes sense norm
did you receive the tokens
you couldn't buy them yet
you still oh yeah i get it i get it you
got it
are you are you happy to see your uh
white paper in in
first of all i have to it's not mine
it's mine and andrew flashing
yeah that's right so let's put it
straight
um yeah and yeah it's very very nice
exciting
um okay i hope norm got his tokens as
well so he can play with us on the
reverse auction we're gonna create it
now
and uh if anyone else wants to play as
well
uh you can send your wallet
you can send your uh winner in their
ticket dinner yes and sorry can you
meantime answer me maybe um what do you
think about
the luna attack
late attack and uh how did you did you
do anything
did you think anything about that in
term in the
kind of in the context of ever never uh
during the ama session uh with the with
the jurors we actually got this question
as well and uh for now
um i don't think we're ready to sort of
prepare for every uh apocalypse scenario
which is i think what can be what this
is what what it can be called i think
for uh for such a blockchain that's
attracted so much liquidity but was
still vulnerable enough and uh
what what i think was wrong with with it
from my point of view uh to be honest i
didn't dig
well too deep into it but i think the
uh
what was wrong with it with was the
reserves that they had were not
um liquid enough for them to cover all
the
all the scenarios and um
it's it's not it's not exactly it's not
precisely just because of the the fact
that it wasn't liquid enough was a
result of attack and uh and the result
itself is is uh is actually
but anyway i don't want to go deeper
into that right i understand but you
didn't like dig into that but anyway uh
we will have to
like
the auctions part actually is the is the
what difference between between our
design and the luna design more or less
and within this mechanism
um the the protection lies within this
mechanism actually
but in order to make it even more
protective
we may be
uh we may add some protection mechanism
to the auctions
in the coming
like
couple of months
um but we will have to formulate it
with vadandru
and then maybe we
will need to add you know all the
implementations we'll need to consider
adding these mechanisms
on top to prevent
the kind of attack
precisely that
because i think this is the only
possible attack on this mechanism
actually
um like
and uh and um
and that mechanism may prevent this
attack
from from
happening
even if you don't have like billions of
dollars in liquidity behind the
behind the number
well we'll have to we'll have to
um
review the
the
the all the possible attack vectors
anyway uh
a bit later with this was like the first
of the first implementation by by the
way we have 50 seconds until the the
open phase ends
this bit actually takes a little more
time to confirm on the network so um i
i'll ask you
whoever is playing still to send your
transactions
i think norm
is uh i'll come back to you to one bill
we'll confirm the transactions i'll come
back to the security thing
uh norm and everyone else who's playing
please make your bids
so it should be
i think a little more than the oracle
suggests or well whatever amount you
want
if you want to win uh i've put my price
is 0-22 in reality you shouldn't see
that but
i wonder if my beat actually went
through yes i did okay cool
it just takes a little more time in
reality you wouldn't see my bit so it's
like a blind auction
um
i'm now confirming
and i'm gonna
also
buy
like
four more
evers
and confirm my beat
so yeah uh going back to
um
do the security stuff um
yeah i believe the the auction
uh the the the nature of this
system with the auctions should uh
probably be
more
i guess resistant
to to such things
uh
but we'll have to
we'll probably have to play with it
more to test it more with uh different
scenarios to see how
it can be um attacked with uh
like different amounts of money with
different amounts of uh
participants and uh maybe with
like
uh i know bots with options because um
right here we have like
uh
you can connect well it's from youtube
um
did you switch to testnet
royal
ro
you have to switch to test now to
connect the wallet
um unfortunately we've already started
the this uh reverse auction so we're in
confirmation phase right now
um
has anyone managed to
uh
so yeah i believe um
that will have to go through the
through a more thorough testing with
this to prevent uh things like
those that happen to luna
and um
yeah we'll be happy to
to
to get any suggestions to to sort of to
test it better or to
to
improve the reliability and security of
this
but yeah
i think this is a more
robust system for sure
and the more a little bit more complex
to be to be honest i
i had to spend some more time to to get
into it but uh but but you know that
this the auction um
is actually like you understand that
these only very large bits should be
allowed right
the whole point of this that's uh
you need it's one actually one of the
protective mechanisms as well
yeah you need to put a lot of money into
that like million uh tokens or something
yeah right now it's for testing purposes
only but yeah
sure the oh my bid actually won
okay
i didn't
so the oracle price was
0.21
i've
uh are actually running oracle in the
background nom is asking
yes there is an oracle in the background
why
uh yeah that's true
uh so yeah i'm gonna claim my evers now
and uh
i have to confirm the transaction
i think that
everyone else can actually buy
uh evers as well after i claim mine
using the the interface i think it
should work
uh
okay
yeah it should my ever should claim soon
yeah
should be
should be good now unfortunately i
didn't remember i don't i didn't i don't
remember how many evers i had before so
i don't know if they actually came back
let's see maybe i had a transaction
i had just say minus five evers
yeah uh i didn't come back yet
uh
the oracle auction integration is on the
next phase um
yeah well maybe for some teams but we
actually made it uh for for this one
we have the oracle running and um
refreshing the price every i think 15
seconds or something
and
yeah they're as far as i know there will
be the next phase which will had which
will have the
improved functionality and maybe
something else
i didn't see the proposal yet
i haven't seen it yet
but yeah we'll see i think it's going to
be interesting as well
so uh yeah
this is uh how this whole thing works
it's pretty easy and complicated at the
same time if you drive deep deeper into
it but on the interface side we um we
try to make it as
like
straightforward and cool as possible of
course you have to know what's happening
to actually participate but if you have
any questions please uh send them to me
or in the device chat we'll be happy to
to tell you
everything about it and uh answer your
questions and
yeah help you in any way
so
if you have any questions right now
please go ahead
um
yeah so i think my tokens actually came
back to me yes i did yeah i think i got
yeah 43 tokens i got them
cool
so
i think i also got the like the
difference between uh my price and the
second price i think
yeah maybe
uh
yeah so um
the auction for some reason is still
open or some i think someone else
created another auction
cool
um okay any questions
any questions i don't see anybody
uh gnome has written
i don't think it's a question it's about
the front it's it's a direct comment to
you about the front end
but um
do you want to address it
um
it might be over complicating things but
one way to protect from front-end
failing is encrypting the bid data with
the seed phrase and uploading it to the
network
um
yes
i think it's
it's one it's probably a good solution
to sort of
bind the the
bit data to
the account i guess that's what you
probably meant
and
[Music]
yeah it's actually a pretty cool
solution we will think about it to you
to sort of have us have it as a
backup variant a backup like plan
for people to save big data
but
yeah
um
okay suggestions
i don't see anything else but i am
thank you very much for sharing that
that was an excellent presentation and
i'm definitely looking forward to
the dbot interface um
and having you on again where
we will be
better prepared and we will be a better
audience
it was a surprise we're like oh wait a
minute
what do we do
um
also i
this is random but your headset is
serious i wanted to ask you about it
like
are you able to talk to aliens with it
it's like oh no it's actually it's a hat
tracker thing i
i play a lot of
simulation games so this thing actually
helps me track my game my
my my head oh wow in real life to
transfer this data to my character and
this allows my you know pilot to rotate
his head yeah so it's it's actually
infrared
uh diodes in here it's badass yeah well
it is so serious
okay cool
um
maybe you could send me a link to what
it actually is so i can look at it
because it's
really interesting it's some uh diy
stuff that i uh my hobby stuff yeah okay
so you kind of engineered it yourself
yeah using using a uh known uh recipe
but yeah i did it myself
with soldiering and stuff
okay really cool thank you thank you for
sharing that thank you to the radiance
team as well
oh gnome has some
questions about the doom
swap um we are done with presentations i
know that ron wanted to jump on for
about a minute and explain something so
maybe after that we can get to um more
questions
so
mr ronald
yeah all right thank you again uh joanne
um yeah uh this is uh kind of the blue
it actually got sent to me
uh during the course of the call um i'd
like to ask if it's possible to bring
easy pay that's the ii zi pay
folks uh on maybe next week's call or
something like that maybe that's a topic
idea
i got some messages from people who
tried using um their service
and as far as i understand
their
uh question is that
there really is no connection to crypto
whatsoever all right now this is just uh
some people complaining so i'm not gonna
um you know
put forth any any ideas of whether
that's true or not but essentially uh
somebody tried uh using their card they
ordered their card they received their
card
mastercard i believe it is
and
[Music]
they try they're asking
um
so
how do i put usdt or uh ever
through this card in order to use it and
the answer comes back that the best way
to swap your tokens is through
evercash.eu
which is a platform for euros and then
to send that directly to the easy pay
i-band
which
you can do that with any debit card at
all
so
uh the question comes back again is that
so what what's what's the connection to
everscale um or to blockchain at all
and they're a little bit concerned uh
that this is not um you know kosher so
to speak
so if we can get the easy pay people
back
to explain that that would be really
really really good because
uh at the moment it's just another debit
card and
and they're thinking that maybe they're
just using every scale as a means to
find customers
in which case
that's probably
you know not a good thing
so that's it
okay yeah that's definitely important
and we have to bring ezp on easy pay on
and grill them
so okay i'll ping them and make sure we
can get some answers and some more
insight
thank you
welcome yep uh gnome what's up
okay so i have uh i'm a little confused
about the proposal first we have the
[Music]
50-second proposal on everdao which
supposedly discusses the
doom swap so we had that rejected
and then we had vladislav
saying something about
another proposal also related to
dune but with origin labs in the title
number 60.
um and this one
but it said but he did mention in his uh
message something about
uh the merger like if it gets accepted
uh we will continue funding this murder
uh i
i assume that meant uh the
dune swap will continue yeah after all
said something else yeah yeah
i can answer that so
um this is just a
problem of names
so
uh
the
uh proposals were a combination so okay
let me start from the beginning so it's
very very very clear right uh they're
uh the reassessment or rather assessment
of uh partnerships and initial members
and
to an extent secondary members right all
members all governance gov old gov
members
was uh to be put up to a vote in three
batches batch one batch two batch three
in each batch there are a certain amount
of mem of governance members and there
are a certain amount of partners the
partners
the
issue that you're having and i guess
that's just because of the naming is
that the the dune
and origin labs
folks are also a governance member
the
dune network
or the new do network swap
was a partnership it was a partnership
arrangement so
proposal number 52 was for the
partnership to continue
the
dune origin labs
proposal number 60
is for
the governance member
to receive
the
balance of their
locked tokens once the growth phase is
over so these are two
separate things
with similar names
proposal number 52 was for the dune swap
that
failed
that's over
what you're seeing in proposal number 60
is uh to unlock tokens for the let's
just call it origin labs the do name is
is confusing let's call it origin labs
to unlock tokens for the origin labs
global governance partner does that make
sense
yeah thank you yep
i think
many people in the dune community are
going to wonder
does this have anything to do with them
does this have anything to do with their
tokens it does not it doesn't proposal
number 60 does not proposal number 52
does
okay
um
i think that's it for presentations i
don't see any other questions on
youtube
and nobody on zoom with a hand up
i think that might be it unless anybody
else wants to jump in
um
okay
well that was a great call i'm sorry and
may i just reiterate that just reiterate
for everybody who's listening uh from
the dune from the dune folks from the
dune community
again the announcement was in the chats
uh but uh not
any different than the forum
it's everybody's responsibility to go to
everettdown.net and monitor what
proposals are on there uh there was a
time when everything went through a sort
of uh mishmash sort of process where
everything went on the forum everybody
discussed it on the forum then
eventually it made it to
globalgov.freeton.whatever
uh and that's where all of the voting uh
was done
this is no different
the forum is still a place where you can
absolutely come discuss put your
you know your comments on there and
everything else but it no longer goes uh
to
the
gov.freetown.org
space
site
to vote it goes to everdao.net
that's where the vote takes place so it
is everybody's responsibility just like
you did before but now to go to
everdao.net and look at what the
proposals are that's that's really the
only difference and again there were
announcements and i understand that you
know but that not everybody was able to
see those announcements immediately but
uh you know we can't
regurgitate the same announcement on a
daily basis so please be diligent uh be
mindful be attentive and go to
everdao.net that's where the proposals
are are going up for about i hope that
clears things up
okay thank you very much
um
we'll see
how this
formulates in the chats what what is
going on
with the next steps and
i don't know
um so
just be diligent that's all
yeah but
it just it sucks it sucks i do want to
argue that
uh
um in general i agree that revoting
things is a bad idea but it shouldn't be
it should be it's not technically
impossible
and it shouldn't be because sometimes
you do want to rediscuss things think of
them from a different point of view
whatever whatever
so
take a proposal
yeah that's
oops losing myself here that's an idea
um
for the dune community to go together
make a proposal discuss things get the
facts together and maybe make a proposal
to
re-vote this could be a solution because
they didn't know of it then and they
didn't have tokens to really have a
voice anyway if they had known about it
so
maybe that's maybe that's a solution
so
um
yeah so moving on i think that's the end
of the call and next week we'll have
some very exciting presentations and
some news some more developments and uh
the world of d-vote is
being piloted in washington at the end
of the month which is huge it's exciting
and
that's about it from us thank you very
much for coming today bye everybody and
have a nice week
bye
you
