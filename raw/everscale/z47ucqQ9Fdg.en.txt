good afternoon everyone
if here are people from the Russian-speaking
community who asked for an ama session
please show yourself raise your hands
so great at least one hand is already
wonderful
introduce yourself please also tell
yourself a little who you are that you
see this that the flow of ipads iphones and so
on the list of participants
day good friends  in that it’s very nice I
have a question right a series of questions let
’s try to figure it out and
how
private not so on the part of
users
or hamsters to understand what’s going on with
everyone’s favorite stove and
therefore here are questions that at first glance
seem unrelated I think that in the end the
roller shooter is the first  the question that
we will be most interested in is the
dow passed the distribution  torrilla is
precisely related to fiorenza
if I'm not mistaken and
correct by falsehood and
if
[music] is a
shorter question, as I understand it,
defiance
leads all the music and the
strategic direction in the development of the
defe as a whole and running the tony waffles themselves and
reading the documents there about what is needed about
distribution  income was indicated, well, not
this monetization scheme, as if
there were no questions in the wrong place, the question simply
arises if it is, otherwise, all
projects similar to individual
tokens are
available for sale and it’s as clear
as the children of the alliance comments to participate in how it
went down or the subscription was closed
, let’s give  we
’ll start a few questions there temporarily, we’ll start with the
answer yes, of course, the
strips before let’s answer
Sasha sergey, so about the
alliance, the alliance
at the moment downey is, that is, he
is, yes, this is a group of funds, here
we were start five companies four
funds and brooks is now seven  companies, and
in principle we will add an average of
1 2 companies in the rank of two  weeks
because each company is getting to know this and
arranging the process,
so answering the question is yes, but in the alliance in the
plans, because so far
there is no one working anywhere and inside the retona suits and 1
before, and it will be yes at the bridge, perhaps
your questions concerned actually the
bridge, they are not  rensa not there, in general,
only concerned politics themselves, these Oleg are not to be
trusted, just guys from the dots and at the
last session asked a question they
are ready to answer for the technical development of the video,
but they don’t participate in all the mathematics of the
financial, it is
taken at the level given where we have not
implemented but  the twins are from the
Xs and
yes there is a text he could eat things a
few
they fundamentally do not correspond to
what is the text of heaven soldering
decentralization and there is an understandable way,
as it were, solo chips are accepted how we
manage it now there and in other
communities, this is all clear as it is
here  will be implemented, that is,
we are declaring that we have a
full-fledged bex yes yes
but to  As such, it is the management of the
cargo of a narrow group of persons in
parts to the apiary.  artem as an anti-cheat
, you can in a nutshell so that the
cokin and different spaced utility
[music]
are synchronized there, it’s just that there was a
charge of a different category and they were initially
positioned that way, that is, this is the whole
definition up to your grandson, if I
correctly understood the different utility tokens not
utility  tokens are different accruals, we
consider this is the same for itself, not only with
currents, but also with the function of managing a
smart contract there, then the voting non-
voting what the party sees can
be a market participant what tools
it is what mechanics it uses this
defining principle function if we
take the classic market date  we have
regulators, and here it seems like a
decentralized community,
but again, it’s decentralized
by whom, from whom, for some reason, the question
didn’t arise very often when he tried to understand,
yes, what’s going on with us, they
gave your document again, I say there
it was written down,
I don’t know how much  you can
trust it was stuffy drag one by one
takes juice like a day received because
you didn’t pay weaving sounded somehow
vulgar as an answer, but
now you can
also join colleagues a little, let’s
stick to it, let’s give a regulation there
, ask a question, raise our hand,
give an answer to that,
otherwise everything will turn into
some kind of  bazaar
to do very, very answers the question is
correct and quite come on, but here,
see the project is now at an
early stage,
for example, the bridge between cutting everything is about
to be de seda, it was in a mode
when the developers controlled all the
Jews for a year and a half, we are going
through this evolution  not for a year and a half, we
launched the bridge more or less in April, we
give it the process of evolution by
September, we come to it in half a year, at
the moment the entire bridge is controlled by
three notes brock itself, that is, we
have Odessa residents for each of them
geographically separated, here it is
signed differently  tomi the moment of transition to the dow
will be only when we finish all the
dead, we will do all the troubles and  which we
do, we have a sorting period before the
transition of the dow transitions in the first
iteration at the end of August at home and important
completion of audits and all updates, we
cannot do it
because yes, and
this is Patrick’s liquidity, that’s why
at the start only the participants are right, as
for the wrong participants, there will be
some suddenly these tokina pro + they we
set 1 floor of liquidity and the
mechanics will already roll out not for a
couple of hours, this process is also
gradual  now I always went through
nonsense sitting and going through in finance all
projects at the start were centralized
with a drop to 0, you need to understand that we
are working on a blockchain that appeared
not so long ago under which the code
base is still not very large, and in fact
now we are the first to have such a large one there
the system is launched as the
maturity of the system increases, the
degree of centralization will increase  and
well, it’s just not a claim, but you can
get it. You have some kind of plan to clarify this situation in your head,
that is, how it will be
implemented, that is, there will be a separate
market or some kind of system for the participants
to realize that the offense will be that
this distribution was given by the side  gave
distributed dates centralization no
let's break it into someone MDO this
form is this form of organization yes, that is, and
understand that wi-fi alliance
bridge
dex are different entities
I understand that
let's not interrupt each other with vegetation
to listen to listen after all who is there just a
question they  in this direction from the question,
look again, I say the developers themselves came in
, you
brought the children here, and he says that we
don’t answer for mathematics, he threw it all away and,
accordingly, the question is precisely the vultures of the
alliance, since it is you who are voiced as the
main people who decide on
finances, then questions  to dow who to you
it's all about the attitude
yes yes dd and painted finances as separate
instruments in  in particular and therefore
to deduce what type as much as what you
mean yes in general once on your side of the
exchange reggie bridges any financial
derivatives
swaps with liquidity, etc. this
means a question to you and questions exactly how
you
gave to execute your legs there on individual products you will say there  there
won’t be douts on every product or in
general, and you’ll act
like we vote like this, as it’s getting in the way now,
just so that we take it into
account so that there’s no such thing as
a standard song about the fact that we have
everything there later  but it’s not clear hertz, let’s
go on the essentials, I
’ll tell you a little more than once, yes, so that a little
clarity is added, just now, Serezha is
trying to say, look, there are
gardens devices in which we are now in which we are
now
holding a vga device session, we are responsible for
looking for a talented team  developers
who will implement various
defo tools based on flitton
so here  a competition is taking place and here
we are developing different building blocks of this
financial system when we say dex,
for example, dicks are now, well, about 5 or
6 acting, in fact, and
they all stood in different degrees of maturity,
some are stronger, some are a little weaker, but
they are all working, respectively  Marriage
sus as one of the participants in the devices
says the same makes its dixon
called tons of words,
respectively defoe alliance is a
completely separate group here the hyphen
will turn which was formed in
order to work on one specific
goal to attract liquidity of
interesting projects in the define segment in
free tone Danish it  this group of funds and the
rights of the participants, which is responsible
precisely to work on this particular task, defoe and the
alliance is not, it does not participate in the
development as such, that is, we are, as it were,
vinegar, a member of the defoe alliance,
but this is completely independent of the children, all the
pain is there, other people are completely away
of our team are involved in its work here
now as for yes, and
at the moment we have only one dow
that is under development, yes, the
bridge has a bridge to the ether network, which
involves three key
functions, the first function is the
distribution of roles between
relay nodes that are responsible for
transmitting messages between different
teachings as sergey said now of these
notes 3, and in order to become scooters, you need to
have some minimum stake in
bridge tokens, which, however, will be able
to put in the auction, so, accordingly,
he was the first stage sat down for the
rights of the participants, which sergey said,
these were just stakes of bridge tokens
to raise your nudes, here is the
second part, yes, and this is
about puzzles and voting, respectively,
repairing 2 parts of the rocket stating that any
person who has bridge tokens
will be able to use a special interface behind the counter to use
their bridge tokens and
distribute the proceeds from g & g and the third
part, this has already crawled by analogy  with
the way the pro called, Tony's waffles are made
very similarly  the system will be bridges when
participants with a certain amount of
bridge currents of nafs can endure from laziness
about the posture to change the logic of the
bridge, as far as control
over liquidity is concerned, there will be
some property qualifications up to 1000,
it can be seen that according to current estimates, we are still
inclined to put
the level of the token in which it is necessary to
have in order to raise the pro, he called at the
level, as it were, to raise his mods, which is
why it is so because everyone is gone,
unlike retona, this is a smart contract
that changes the logic of work with dzhen, that
is, for example, adds support for
some tokens change the configuration of
supported  networks change there
different settings stages in the voting
, etc.  etc.  and accordingly, here are all the
changes, all upgrades of the
bridge after the launch, yes, they will be done
only through this voting system, so,
accordingly, you tea to your question
about how the community can participate, yes,
that is, as Sergey said, there will be a
certain ir drop bridge of tokens for
those participants who participate in the first place
early testing of the bridge for
those who
helped us debug the farming
out mechanics, and so on, but just
collecting even statistics on these
participants is an extremely difficult task, that
is, it is not instant, so this
has not yet been done, plus there is another
moment related to the fact that  we
will not launch a dow until
we are one hundred percent sure of
its security there, which
is why now two teams of
independent auditors are working on the
analysis of source codes and smart
contracts and the server part not to
confirm that before the
vulnerability there are serious vulnerabilities in
these products  no, as soon as we
get such an audit  horsky conclusion, we
will be able to release the protocol with
support before there are still green factors
that are related to the place of implementation of the
interfaces, because well, you probably
want to still drain there in a convenient
way through the web interface correctly and without
entering commands into the tone of the cli, these
interfaces are now also located  in
development, I really hope that by the end of
August we will have time to roll them all out because
there are a lot of rather
non-trivial mechanics, this is what
sergey also spoke about a little earlier on the
call, this is what the windex team
took the initiative and also wants to
join this dow system with
their bridge  yes, this is also a very good
sign that roughly speaking the community will not have to
spend twice the effort there to
raise these tools, so I hope I
managed to clarify the
issue a little, let's see, and I correctly
understood that your logic will
look like this in no way  for
each product, a separate topic will be a
separate structure for dow
management  he has an interface and sisters well
and yes and no and yes and no it strongly depends
on the specific product, for example, the
swap tone, we are not yet sure that a
system is needed there, yes, namely, which will
regulate
this global exchange, because
in fact the comments
are in tune  with you, we are not planning a
separate cinema chisel in tune with
each lp pool will manage itself, that
is, we, as a developer, are rolling out an
update that is
[music]
LPS voting may not be the mother of deciding
which commissions are which to you and profitability, and
so on, that is, it will be  but it turns out
that the horns of the fish of forces will sink for
their liquidity, that is, as soon as
someone placed their liquidity,
they understand the decision how it will work
and the dynasty then I will clarify one more
question about the texts and dows in relation to them,
since you often 4 projects I know you
talk about 6, respectively,
their management now comes from the element of
trust, there is no hell, we don’t know
how their worker is arranged and correctly
how their oracles are arranged and we don’t understand the
whole mechanics of placing
currency pairs,
evaluate the code yes yes yes yes and on the
protector because in the
end it comes down to them that this is the center of any
children and give no well, well, because every
every dex every dex works then  yes,
it works in one way flex will
work without
this right of each dics to build their own
system,
in fact, speaking proton is weak, in
principle, all source codes of all
contracts of everything to use with you,
it is available in the public domain in our
repository
, including we are planning the next  it’s time
to choose his concert, also the interface
part, in fact, it’s that you could already
finally make sure that everything
works there exactly as they say, not in
words but in deeds, what you could
look at in the code, get into it to see
how the contract part works, that’s all
that
thank you
question arising from our  structure
if defe
dex dex iii are not related to the
direct
defiance office raid and wire as
dep  a separate division,
explain why we attract
liquidity,
this mechanism has proven itself very well
on the part of the
stock exchange pancakes inci who like that they
use the mechanism to
constantly be present on the market with orders,
that is, it’s clear why they need
liquidity, the
number of transactions increase and you
why then this one with  you are making a
wiki-wiki we are freezing can you explain
Dasha it costs a lot of money yes why in
the first place tones try to
imitate them, that is, the same as
there in the second during the month the main
trading volumes moved from the sex exchange to the
disk index which is
2  moment 3 moment we showed other
projects and now a lot of projects will be
proud plus we have to launch
a token constructor and anyone can
launch their projects using
a and by and fight this liquidity
that suits the system
without that is, nothing works in terms of one liquidity center
that is, it turns out that
by and large farmim pays
the X program is right, the math is like this,
but they don’t give a defo stage of which it all
comes from a flitton, but the
dens of the rhyton regions have
91 of one of the options how to
use these divers is to launch
farming you and programs for new
projects and to attract liquidity,
but it’s logical and a
landfill  and Biysk just look at them
there are specialized exchanges all the same yes
they are not about everything and for everyone they are not taken
in some areas all that we
lyse you on the blockchain there are some of my
decisions in general these are allowances so no
I don’t understand it at all I understand well
I farm  in all projects in large
sums, it’s been a very long time, but you
understand that you’re not a fact, of course, of
course, for farming, this is a method of
attracting liquidity, I have been given,
and now you just look at what a logical one
arises now, the amount of 15
million crystals
will be distributed to me too  we were
also told about the stocks of 10 million in the form of
remuneration
lies in trouble
about the grooves of the puzzle, sort of like it
where the amount turns out to be 25 there 30 million
crystals will be 1 given as a
reward here I’m not mistaken I
don’t confuse anything 15 million this is farming
10 million lie on other goals not
related to the legs 11 million look and the
second amount that goes if there is
present what we give will give  should
reach a turnover
per yard, it is not clear whether it is entry and exit
or the total turnover of the work
, one logical question arises
if we say that this is the final amount of
15 million stalker to roughly speaking at the
entrance, yes, this is one and a half percent if we
take something turn to there and shoulder
it turns out there that flour there is 10 percent of
income guaranteed for the entire
period of time and we really
have some calculations somewhere, because
at the primary jump it was only some kind of
monstrous distortion of the data, it
seemed that the current
file program is one of the
experiments  this is experiment number
four this is 4 1 safe conditions
2 run hybrid Eunice wolf and have  the same
dex and the third one was launched with a similar
design but with different marketing and the 4th
leading now
billion is the liquidity target that
we want to get in the leg frit ecosystem
and achieve this target with a fluid temple
program of course it’s impossible with the current
form program we show how
it works with another fund to other
players  how volumes grow how
new projects appear so that at the next
stages they also come in with their
liquidity, pull up new projects and
high-profile projects will soon be not but
mathematics is understandable sergey look I
clearly understand what is a distortion and
what is the string of numbers that appear
officially you first on  my questions were
confirmed why they became
distorted
all the numbers we have just dancing,
look only it turns out either one of the
two actually spend your net
nominal or the numbers declared
do not converge and really it
looks like a giant battle,
it’s not clear what plans are and it’s just for
weight  either  it’s
just that there is no cycle, they are not calculated, because
I say again even if we
calculate the input to the output and take 10
leverage, there 100 million, it turns out there is
15 percent, roughly speaking, we guarantee
profitability and you really think
that there are more liquid projects on the market
, we are  we can attract at 15
percent or we will be forever Artyom
I repeat
there is a certain set of proposal
proposal the first current
farming program 15 million tokens there is a second
thesis that the goal of the defy alliance is to
attract a billion liquidity
between this proposal there is also a
bunch of everything naturally that here  this is the
current form and the program ahead of
millions of tokens does not achieve this goal
, it’s important to achieve you can,
here’s how the participants as an internal kitchen,
roughly speaking double, we can get
some kind of ren king, that is, approximately
orient yourself, yes,
some number has never sounded there,
let’s say, but by whom  this is she here defo and yes and the
development of adex is the future spend  m there is a
floor
so that the leons of the crystal k in general
will cost the whole disco for
two years there are some plans there are
okay we understand there is a shed yes
we all exhaled like we are acting within the
framework of the plan yes it doesn’t matter the falcon it is
terrible the main thing is something like  as a plan,
you just understand, once again I say a series of
disparate data that you have
to collect bit by bit,
not in one place are not presented even in
some form of the slightest financial
calculations for there, such questions
arise,
you understand, if you now say
that such and such an amount is up to about
it’s planned, well, here’s a landmark for you, then
there, there, up to billions, for example, up to the
landmark of the canopy, well, in the future there,
we’ll understand the remuneration, okay,
but you understand in separate issues and
if you want it
,
Thomas has these numbers, that is, I’m disgusting you, which
type is all some yes
when even a few love back when we
launched dx and dy what trades in dex and
I say that in
their numbers the profitability of the market and all our
trades  is in the mixer range there
20-30 million dollars this is what
was expected to get dixie on the current
farmiga program and we have achieved this goal
with regard to work with dealers of sheds
and future sheds is called mass
mass token from where it is in viria then
we still do not have full consensus
internally  lol about how it will
work when we come to a consensus, we
publish it okay and the range is also
not approximately give no frame at least but from
art dota example what is being considered
well, maybe of course verse
1 he also says to
children but you understand also what is on  in
fact, as sergey said, now experiments are underway,
so far the experiment has not
ended, that is, the current taras is
planned for completion at the end of august at the
beginning of september,
if I remember correctly, after that there
will be some intermediate
summing up in general, how well the program
from work, how well did you manage to
work these or those  mechanics
because a lot of work is done by
tacos  which, well, is not visible on the
surface, in fact, that is, there
is a lot of
communication with the market, but if you
look at the schedule there, my sergey of
other members of the alliance, probably half the
time is spent on calls for this,
according to a modest estimate, so
that just the same  to attract projects, and so
on, and of course, our task is
to make flitton noticeable on the
radars of large funds on the radars of
large investors, and so on, that is,
because they will pull along not
only negative liquidity
, first of all, the attention is very serious from the
side of the organic press  which we
still lack for an hour; secondly, they are
Putin’s audience, which we
also lack here and, but objectively, I think
that if we enter the top 50, why markt
cap then by capitalization of the entire
project by capitalization traction warm
then it will go about  real organics yes,
because in any case, everything before
this will be an experiment,
there is some information again  well, here you
will sum up the results there, yes, you
initially had some kind of balance, this is the price of
interrogating an attracted user, the amount of
his service there, the board of which
money was spent, roughly speaking, per
person there, for 1 dollar of
funds raised, and similarly
, you have the usual financial indicator  they have an
approximate plan, and here and there the
results so that they can compare some
sees, usually somewhere, there is some kind of
document, it is preliminary, that is, it is
framed as a
fallen document, I can
say that in the current body a
little more than half is a means
of
percent alliance  30 are big players, that is,
these are new funds and traders, more
investors who are testing and
20 percent to retail with small
watches call checks up to thousands of dollars,
well, I understood incomplete, so dad saying
it’s understandable, but such a question is why the
swap bridge is cruelly down from the moment
which, in principle,  there is no universe, too, in
response, you will now tell me it is
mathematicians, as well as b  I understand, but
physically it’s not a coin,
such situations arise because, again, the
decisions made before there aren’t written anywhere
how the coin comes across from here
which company passes how it
works how to avoid this you have a plan I don’t really understand how the compliance of Dixes works  you can put any coin in dex in
terms of liquidity, well,
yes, that’s it, roughly speaking, before the
open auction, we can really
pay and go to trade, but we
are talking about the public together now, what is being
done with your signature, but this
concerns, as you can see, the steed, that is, if we
we are talking about there new projects
that are coming, yes, well, for now, we
are a bait of qualification arena, what we do with
joy, as we do when we
have
already given it, we will work better
or it may not be 3d exo-l streaming,
this will be a vote  liquidity and
at this stage, just roughly speaking there
data so that is, but there, yes, I think how
you want, look, probably they are going to test, you
understand  say that in order that, that is,
Felton is an absolute blockchain
for the entire market, and
first you need to dial some critical
Mars in different projects, conduct an
experiment with a set so that later you
can arrange the complex procedure of
Sergei Burdenko, well, no one
uses Flitton, the new project is
young, it’s just  another, that there are
just well-tested mechanics of how it’s
done, that is, let’s say there are
requirements for a prokhor, if there are conditions there
for passing, if we get
these mechanics, we already have a document we can
even make it public, it
kills all rumors and speculation, roughly speaking,
there would be more documents  and half of
the reasoning,
you understand, please, there is also
so much work that no, we don’t always have
time, we just shift it into it and
all all all this is all in an artifact don’t don’t
look for seconds I’m just listening yes, as
I understand it, we are talking about projects
that are involved in the
chris lohan program  shake on the pro which we
recently also communicating
pro  so that you understand, let's
tell you a little about the procedure for how
we select such projects, we are now
preparing a document that
actually will describe the entire
procedure for going through, but here we have
three key points, the first
point is that this is formal compliance, yes,
that is, we do not take on  board projects
that have not passed formal compliance
in full form with checking there and bio with
checking their consistency of everything
else, that is, we request a package of
documents approximately as you would provide there,
for example, when listing on
crocs,
approximately the same package of documents,
respectively, the chic place manager
analyzes these documents  they give non-
clarifying questions,
all sorts of uncomfortable ones, and according to the results, as a
rule, 70-80 percent of projects already
fall off because they had
some kind of negative traction in the
past, because they don’t have a
viable business plan, because there
is no normal structure within
who do not plan to work and  so
on further, we begin the stage of collecting
information
on the reputation of the founder of the project there is
networking we are quite rich on
like all members of the alliance, that's why we
collect all available information on
our setting for king about this project
and where it came from who its founder
where they used to be  they were noticed how much
they do not fulfill their
obligations there, and so on. The third stage
is how much the project is able to manage
its liquidity of its own; it
somewhat clearly understands how much
money it will keep excellent
team development, how much it will
send to the market, how much it will
sell to investors, and so on  moreover,
we take only those projects that do
not have free float, but intentionally in the market
because, firstly, this will
make it possible to make their Brazilian tokens more honest
, and secondly,
it will help us push the project right away
so that it issues tokens immediately
on krypton and moreover, right away
planned the implementation of the logic
because that's all  the whole
partner model that they unsuccessfully tried to
apply there last year in a brothel, it
showed one thing there that, but not very
partners are interested in
implementing logic on a fleeton, so we
are also trying to solve this problem
so that the project
starts to work organically on fleek, then not  create a payload for it
so that these same
tone crystals are not just like
some kind of speculative instrument and
whether they have a utilitarian value, yes, and
this will allow, among other things, to
answer the question of
specific investors such as, due to which
price flows
will form positive pressure will be created  on the
price of the token due to organic
demand, this set of factors,
respectively, plus communication plus the
audience of this project,
they form the final decision yes,
this is a process that they
just don’t know
how to describe, I have to spend weeks of my time
because it’s really difficult and all
moments are extremely difficult there  hard to describe but
then there the formal pieces are already
ready, and we, too, in principle, can
share their indicators there; there is nothing
so extraordinary.
then a new
client in this regard, we, our
activity is a little like a fund, by and
large I
understood thanks from there such a question is one
of the last ones, normally even the last ones, and
you focus more on large
funds until you can explain why they
play a role
in what kind of Senka and drafting Yes, this is
very good for me  - it’s very simple that the farmer is arranged in this way everywhere
, that is, to stand up for the evolution of
all large protocols, all the
distribution compound starts there in July last
year, when we started doing
farmak on a large scale there, the distribution of
checks was strongly shifted there,
dollars were filled up, that is, 90
cents of money were  only with large checks,
this does not mean that the funds are correct,
these  some, that is, in fasteners, crypto believe
that it didn’t kill the ethereum, kept there, they tell us
to achieve a manner no, of course, I with this
article can be there to make some
description of who they call large funds
, I have a fund there, then it’s not somewhere that
this ruler rules the fund is licensed
everything else  fund I call groups of
traders
funds hedge funds that are liquidators and
very large players in an ecosystem with
large assets, so I put there is
no generalized term to
combine their essence,
so the
main thing is probably that they have
expertise in defoe and in addition, that is,
in addition to day  but they still understand how defo
and work, and again they have their own
resources of competent specialists
who can benefit purely
apart from money, because for example, the
very early stage bridge validators
should clearly understand but at
least have a good devops department to
serve these but  you must understand
how to work with such complex systems
so that there is no experience  for example, in the past,
I don’t know about parts in some kind of
cut and so on or similar
projects, so that they have
validator power there, for example, after
two chains, this greatly reduces the
entry threshold, because in this
case we can be sure there that it’s
elementary  but let’s not stand up for the fact that
whoever paid for the hosting there had to pay for
such cases, in fact,
they happen there regularly, okay question, just
look at it logically, it also appears
we have a lot of advertising, we meet to give
an interview to the back of the lats says that we
plan to attract a partner who
Stalin is quoted there from the telegram channels, the blessing is not connected there at all, the
script is oh yes there, and they just
go in that mass and this retail advertising is not
aimed at funds, that is, why I
ask such a question, that is, these
dissonances
questions arise
that Stalin
does not
see an example  gave an example that he would eat
better himself everyone is familiar with criticism there
contributions to the like up to which about
you if  and specialized communities, yes
, there are news ones, it just slipped, that’s
exactly the series, the series of this interview and the
numbers slipped, but this is retail in
its purest form,
why do these questions I say still kind of
arise because we see the
whole invisible picture there are questions
to get
this kind of
people
we don’t have I passed  we were discussing
artem there the question of advertising what is advertising going
on, that’s exactly what
Filatov’s interview was very often about
the plans for development and attraction of
mycelium, well, there’s how the 100 heading date was
chosen, the volume plans to reach figures
indicative in the summer, I don’t remember verbatim,
but here’s a photo was present  at the
thought of a public, we had a
fludilka of this good stuff in bulk, well,
it’s understandable, look here, just again,
you need to share it, there are different
positioning of the product, and plus a hangout,
it’s still not one product as such,
yes, it’s already a whole family of products
that, among other things, work for free
tony i.e. u fritz network frit  it’s
global yes, of course, it has its own goals and
objectives, the segment dress inside the flitton network
has its own goals, the tasks
gathered us nfc also has its own goals and
objectives, and so on, various
national ones,
I’m in reserve about something else, what
specifically define the segment specifically in
relation to, for example, the same bridge  and
evabridged about the cinema of the dow system and the
like
now communication is the one that is it is
aimed exclusively at
professional participants for those who
understand what it is by the way if we
just look at these bridges
with such a speculative point of view then
here is just a
plus of the fact that they  for example, now it’s
already available on black, you see the
canvas of the same dance itself and
that, well, just a person from the street can
go to buy it in any amount, in
fact, now the offer is on tone with
you, in my opinion, for half a million of these
bridge tokens, that is, in principle, who wants to be
there with  the market can buy chip in there
for example yes or there to buy entirely
did not recommend this  to do this very
narrow curves of this I will comment on
telegram yes we are still working so we are
experimenting there are 34 agencies
up to which we also work if
tail as an element of testing but if you
add up the
ratio of resources there the
alliance work only
with funds directly but with large ones  structures of a
little of these agencies, what you will see in the
body, yes, we also bought a little traffic
and we are looking into what it is converted into how
it works the
experiment fence these are experiments for now
I will say the experiment merged with scrap is rather
unsuccessful than successful in comparison with funds
on the side of sergeli,
I apologize in advance, well, it’s just that there
you won’t formulate what you
said at the very beginning in a different way yes pavel pavel
paul
yes
you said at the beginning yes because here we
are nothing more than the god of chindo everything that is inside
this unit here questions  we are not there
and it showed itself well there on the air to
places with all the scandal now there
Vitalik does
n’t do everything in everything, but one gets the
impression from the answers, including that
I’ll give this grumbling, but for
this, Brooks is already
defiance of
answers, and so all the
questions, please, find out everything with them, this is a
narrow niche, but large in scale  in the
field of money lies a narrow group of and
topic that should be under and not be on the
solution of trust issues it is proposed to
use the outdated mechanism
trust understand
your comments
to work
completely in
general about the management of
2 terminals and
and strategic decisions I understand
remains in this side is not attached
just trust and  wait right then
we can see something very clearly like -
tony suggests trusting
artem artem you should have just started an
introductory say about still I don’t understand you are a
developer you are an investor you save
what you saw on you can a little more about
yourself because you always want to talk in the
context  that's when us it
deceived us 1 channel us i want to
develop they can't
document us  well,
tell us a little about yourself,
bring a little and wishes, that’s what you would
advise, are you ready for some kind of interrogation regime for a
prisoner of war,
no problem, it’s all right, okay,
we’re here for this and have gathered to
answer it through technology from him
really fast and even people
who were not involved in the groaning never
touched yours
in my line of acquaintance yes they were
pleasantly surprised by the comparison there with all the
bitcoins mythical wallets
technology message there [ __ ] how it
developed well and of course the
technology that may be
developed is of course interested and
ok these are some aspects just
to understand  how it moves in what
direction what projects how they
are being implemented and at what stage is
this ad-dina information other information
date that we are often there those who do not
participate in the competition from her issued
book buy tokens on the exchange yes there is
hope there and nastya kinky for  works
it to me what for x they came here well
about  one hundred positions only when some
amounts are not critical for someone,
and we see what happens to the
exchange rate in principle, yes, we understand there the
influence of a share of the 3rd fleet of free
circulation there, but it’s all farm
programs and the like  here
I speak simply as here are the questions
that we have squirrels before it itself matures,
we communicate there in no way by a group of people and
these questions just appear there for a long time
and so that and how to remove we got to you
and all and the interests of different
cultures of different terminals there like this  and I
’ll answer this way about the pressure from the market at
some point, but we publish something and
I can only say in advance that the
share of farming you long market inserts
15 percent 80 percent of the tokens
that arrived on the exchange, this is undeniable,
yes, yes, it’s clear that they are distributed over time
well, it’s not scary for
just being ready to understand, but then again,
we don’t know the finiteness but you yourself are
talking from zero to infinity
now 15 then you are talking about pro
s  look at the strategy too, here’s how I
’ll answer why
most often he remembers the
commemoration of the team, marriage with yes there and the
alliance, well, firstly, brock sus in general, in
principle, with the filing of Brooks, the defo began
to develop and the movement in the brothel, I
remind you that we were originally our own
when when it was  it was already there
more than seven or eight months ago, in
my opinion, in September last year, if I
'm not mistaken,
that's just the same we took the
initiative to create devices to
be proud of simply because we understood,
but since we are in the market deep in the market,
that is, we communicate es ist  raider
teams from the funds and with everyone
else, we understood that defo is
what my give away the rapid development of flitton
in there for the next few years to the bottom
that everything should be limited only to
geforce defarge, the most is in its
heyday and
the right time, so just the
same
we
style and  we began to actively discuss this,
therefore we are most of all people visible, but
this does not mean that there is a conditional dialect  I am in
defoe and there is the hand of brooks
defoe and there is still a huge number of
other
fund companies, and so on, which
after that do not really want to communicate publicly,
as it were, but at the same time they also bring
their own benefit, because through them in
many ways we can achieve other
protocols with them  to communicate yes there to
drag an interesting idea of a task in gen
ral, by the way, gamma devices were originally 
n building the code base, which then 
ill allow you to create all the necessary f
nancial architecture on free Tony a
d now we are actually only in the
first 3 ways, by and large, yes,
that is, digitex is a different a
row  the oracle is the same
basic architectural structure of the
visitor that has yet to be
created, and even there the same swap here,
which has gone a little ahead, but from my
personal point of view, how to seal boxing since
it, too, has begun its initial 100
stages of development, there will still be a
lot of development  everything is interesting is planned
further as when the
case scenarios will come here  and it’s not only connected with the
definitions so much with finances, this
will be the victory of krypton, that is, I
’m talking about logistics about and comics
about various other applications of different
highload systems that will
move, for example, from traditional
systems, there to free cooling, this is what will give the
necessary load  flitton and let
him and stake out his place in the sun,
but for now we are at the stage when
it is important to draw attention to flitton as much as
possible and, unfortunately, in the
modern market, especially cryptocurrencies,
attention is determined by numbers, yes, that is,
some billions of liquidity are locked in the
rating on the horse market  fasten and
scoundrel market as they also don’t want to
just come to with a leaf, just do
n’t come
knocking with legs from different ends, etc.,
such is this work that the
members of the alliance do and a
lot of people who actually sympathize
, including those who are present here in the
devices saying  we are actually like
brooks himself we are exactly the developer of the cat  which
allows, on the one hand, to develop
some common approaches to a similar
product, here is to make a decision
that can be trusted, but again, I
want to believe that they are trusted, but even with
not so, we have auditors somewhere on it
who check so that it can
always be a device  orcs are open for questions
by the way ,
surprised when people come to me they
say you don't answer questions there
this every thursday we are going to be always
ready at it's own level as it ticks
you understand up they break through very hard to
come devices of the gods
are open to everyone
thank you about the infrastructure yes definitely
we’ll get out there doing it so you don’t have any
questions here, but again, yes,
you’re now operating to what you
say audit audit there and it
will sound several times again, but why should we
go on a snail to reddit, we’ll look
at your
hobbies to give them first  firstly, yes,
now it is open; secondly, the reason to
hide the term of the lessons from the bone we
used about the horns when  the tone doesn’t
exist yet, but how then is the sample and in
theory then why the words of the text
are present if they are not cottage cheese whiskeys is
in no way connected with the oracle
because this is what is called mmmm
works without roads no
mm this is turnover liquidity this is an example of the
constant presence of orders and money in
there is no market no m m orders no
changed attitude there
crypte Lucian on classical
marketing itself was present this funds
they deal with them there is nothing new here there is
no question then another contracts
smart contracts should be executed
far depending on nothing
before kicking the users themselves look
let's have some  -something fundamental
is the understanding of how it works, and
m m  such that there is a
curve of the
ratio of sob  2 assets and it
is called as a product precisely because the
product of a nozzle and 2 assets is always
constant, it can change
only if someone brings
additional liquidity from both legs,
that's who pulls their own contract and
the users themselves who come and
make an exchange, they bring  it turns out to the
liquidity floor of one of the legs yes you are
called to take the other leg because of
this position of the point but this curve on
change this this .  it determines the price of
its own row asset in relation
to a friend and
that is, articles yes yes yes by the way,
look, yes, thank you very much
for describing what is called smog or
transfer through the night you could contract before the
transition,
this is not yes, of
course, I
’m talking again about I didn’t think  of a financial
instrument, he borrowed the classic
what you are talking about the swap market transition
through the night of the position with recalculation and
therefore rebalancing occurs
from where the temporary so-called
losses always occur in the
state of movement of orders I have a
few mechanics for this issue you do not
explain and no matter how thank you very much I would  in the
topic, I have a question of circles, who is how
the decentralization system is implemented
in general terms,
please, that is, we have it there for some
solutions to the issue, it is
deeply decentralized, yes, look
again
m.m.  it’s not something that
someone controls yes maxim that the
developer can control it’s the source
code of the contract catch and the logic of them
works all these contracts they are
in the public domain and you can
predict them independently to look at and
so on
anyone can create a pool you
want  there, I don’t know, take two tokens and
go there now, I don’t know, but the same
sawing tone is not weak, it’s not important to create a pool,
no one will forbid you to do
this, yes, it says that it will forbid you to
create pools, exactly the same pole, you
can come to absolutely any floor with
your own  coin and exchange for another
coin, again, no one will ever
forbid you that everything is on the blockchain, and here the
logic of the work of just the same and the dics
is that it is not completely
executed on the blockchain and
without any interaction with any
raccoon servers it's like
oracles like oracle again it won't be a
handyman case it's just a
tool to provide data i.e.
prices  For example, a new oracle uses stay
book in order to
balance its reserves and equalize it to
align with the market, on
the ether network itself such a popular cancer
is than link
yes which is used if I'm not
mistaken to and a compound to balance
their reserves and
in general all  forces aning
tony waffle protocol now there is a competition
called
what is the name of the
distributor 2 liters of paint this is a concept
developed by the dog tone team and even there
now, in my opinion, at least two
participants are trying to
implement it, but besides this there are a billion
different ways how you can
provide
prices for  blockchain and but for dix in the general
case I don’t need the rain itself forms the
prices just the same along this curve inside
each grandfather well you intelligence
but if I come and you come there you
buy and I sell it is very difficult to
do without the
price you increase there
shows just the same by the ratio of these two
assets  in which he is in the field and
shows you the price of the scrub burn with a fact
in the pool there are 10 bitcoins, I don’t know it there
100000 yu with d t, respectively, so far
it’s one nickel is 10000 yes yes and
vice versa
10 something there bitcoin like this
works m  m there is someone who came and put it
there, for example, the children took
some piece of bitcoin from there, your attitude has
changed the status, the price has moved up and
in centralized exchanges where there is
a system for beeches, as a rule, there
are orders for buying and orders for
selling this
dixie levels out quickly enough, too, someone will come
someone, for example, in the opposite direction,
example, sell sdt from buy throws, this
price is balanced, let's arbitrate
when just the same, anyone can
come here to buy a cue ball and sell where
there is a free market a coin by investment yes,
that is  it’s clear that it’s just a
solution that they need so that
people who come here do
n’t feel the construction of worlds, of course, for
this you need to provide liquidity  there are
pools again so that anyone who wants to
buy from this floor and whether Kristan
had to play that’s why for those who
provide liquidity you see the
lp provider and there are farming
programs yes because it’s profitable for them
to keep this liquidity in the floors
until it’s on the paint  anyone could come
and exchange any amount of currencies there
for any amount
they have inter-minute loss there, in
fact, to the extent that they hold the body there, as a
result, they get this liquidity in return,
they make dad talking, which is why
we encourage the farmiga program not to
keep this liquidity there  only by
bringing the TVL to a certain size, we
will become visible on the radars of large
investors and an organic track will flow to us, Tanya,
that farming is not forever,
it needs to be understood, that is, money is
not endless, but it is important for the period
while we are working with different
motivation programs  including also farming
to attract as much liquidity as possible
so that it is already here  t stayed and
held on its own tass so
developed in fact the whole circle of
such
me all thank you very much please
thank you very much for the question and in
fact it was very interesting to talk
if you have any more questions please every
Thursday we are here at the same time come
ask thanks
thank you artyom  if anyone else has questions,
please raise your hands,
well,
I hope that for the work of the comrades, yes, yes,
let's go to work, do a lot of work
and the zord phrase will change, respectively,
many thanks to everyone who came who
asked questions, we are always happy to
answer them to clarify  because
defo is one of the most probably complex
financial technologies
and there are a lot of nuances, of course it’s difficult
for everyone to figure it out on their
own, but we are here for this,
thanks to everyone, have a good evening, we visited
later
