but uh but it's already it works i mean
 

259
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,550

don't uh put your live repositories in

262
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
don't uh put your live repositories in
 

263
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,350
don't uh put your live repositories in
it yet because of my restart

so it's just for experiments now

268
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
so it's just for experiments now
 

269
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,189
so it's just for experiments now
but they are quite important experiments

270
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
but they are quite important experiments
 

271
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,950
but they are quite important experiments
because gosh is solving two problems

as with each repository actually there
 

279
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,990
as with each repository actually there
is there is a dow created

280
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
is there is a dow created
 

281
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,150
is there is a dow created
you can see here there is a detail about

282
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
you can see here there is a detail about
 

283
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,270
you can see here there is a detail about
dao

284
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
dao
 

285
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,830
dao
and there are events which are well not

286
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
and there are events which are well not
 

287
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,749
and there are events which are well not
in this repository but anyway you can

288
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
in this repository but anyway you can
 

289
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,270
in this repository but anyway you can
see if you go to the repositories there

290
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
see if you go to the repositories there
 

291
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,189
see if you go to the repositories there
are some events but you can browse that

292
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
are some events but you can browse that
 

293
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,950
are some events but you can browse that
test events for example merge commits

294
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
test events for example merge commits
 

295
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,350
test events for example merge commits
and there are there are dow voting for

296
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
and there are there are dow voting for
 

297
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,870
and there are there are dow voting for
this merge commits

298
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
this merge commits
 

299
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,110
this merge commits
so you can actually like the the dow is

300
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
so you can actually like the the dow is
 

301
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,390
so you can actually like the the dow is
deployed immediately when you create

so so that is that is in the second one

308
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
so so that is that is in the second one
 

309
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,390
so so that is that is in the second one
is is the is the security

310
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
is is the is the security
 

311
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,270
is is the is the security
and security is the software uh

312
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
and security is the software uh
 

313
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,830

um and secure software supply chain is a
 

317
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,230
um and secure software supply chain is a
big problem right now particularly for

318
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
big problem right now particularly for
 

319
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,589
big problem right now particularly for
uh like

320
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
uh like
 

321
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,510
uh like
you know mission critical applications

322
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,520
you know mission critical applications
 

323
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,070
you know mission critical applications
and big corporations as well

324
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
and big corporations as well
 

325
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,629

uh and blockchain applications for for

326
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
uh and blockchain applications for for
 

327
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,869
uh and blockchain applications for for
certain we can see that right now with

328
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
certain we can see that right now with
 

329
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,110
certain we can see that right now with
upgrades to the to the network and how

330
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
upgrades to the to the network and how
 

331
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,189
upgrades to the to the network and how
we struggle with that if we would have

332
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
we struggle with that if we would have
 

333
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,790
we struggle with that if we would have
gosh and we will have gosh we will move

334
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:56,800
gosh and we will have gosh we will move
 

335
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,230
gosh and we will have gosh we will move
all repositories of of the of the

soon once it will be production stable

340
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
soon once it will be production stable
 

341
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,390
soon once it will be production stable
ready

342
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
ready
 

343
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,029
ready
um and which is expected within three

344
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
um and which is expected within three
 

345
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,629
um and which is expected within three
months i think

346
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
months i think
 

347
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,589
months i think
and and then uh and then we will be able

348
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
and and then uh and then we will be able
 

349
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,350
and and then uh and then we will be able
to secure the delivery of the node uh to

350
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
to secure the delivery of the node uh to
 

351
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,510
to secure the delivery of the node uh to
the to the network as well through this

352
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
the to the network as well through this
 

353
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,189

uh through this thing
 

355
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,950
uh through this thing
so yeah that's this is just

356
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
so yeah that's this is just
 

357
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,710
so yeah that's this is just
just a quick overview

358
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,720
just a quick overview
 

359
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,629
just a quick overview
of what cautious

360
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
of what cautious
 

361
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,909
of what cautious
and

362
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
and
 

363
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,270
and
the network that

364
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
the network that
 

365
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,189
the network that
has been started is again is a closed

366
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
has been started is again is a closed
 

367
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,389
has been started is again is a closed
network uh and the reasons

368
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
network uh and the reasons
 

369
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,110
network uh and the reasons
for for this uh

370
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
for for this uh
 

371
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,589
for for this uh
being started like this is first of all

372
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
being started like this is first of all
 

373
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,990
being started like this is first of all
there is um

374
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
there is um
 

375
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,870
there is um
economic i would say

376
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
economic i would say
 

377
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,350
economic i would say
reasons because um it it takes right now

378
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
reasons because um it it takes right now
 

379
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,630
reasons because um it it takes right now
enormous amounts of gas to to do that

380
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
enormous amounts of gas to to do that
 

381
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,750
enormous amounts of gas to to do that
all that

382
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
all that
 

383
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,750
all that
and because

384
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
and because
 

385
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,509
and because
this thing competes with

00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
this thing competes with

or kind of
 

389
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,430
or kind of
will compete with github and gitlab at

390
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
will compete with github and gitlab at
 

391
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,910
will compete with github and gitlab at

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
the developer
 

395
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,829
the developer
are not expecting to pay gas for

00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
creating every commit
 

399
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,509
creating every commit
they're not going to do that very simply

400
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
they're not going to do that very simply
 

401
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,509
they're not going to do that very simply
and um

402
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
and um
 

403
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,230
and um
so it is impossible to launch it on the

00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
so it is impossible to launch it on the
 

405
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,990
so it is impossible to launch it on the

is that you pay for except for eos maybe

420
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
is that you pay for except for eos maybe
 

421
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,910
is that you pay for except for eos maybe
but

422
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:35,920
but
 

423
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,870
but
still it's even with eos you have to you

424
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:38,880
still it's even with eos you have to you
 

425
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,269
still it's even with eos you have to you
have to deposit bond

426
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
have to deposit bond
 

427
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,509
have to deposit bond
so that you need to pay money up front

428
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:43,519
so that you need to pay money up front
 

429
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,870
so that you need to pay money up front
basically

430
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
basically
 

431
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,150
basically
and

432
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
and
 

433
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,790
and
that's a show stopper for application

434
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800
that's a show stopper for application
 

435
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,590
that's a show stopper for application
like

436
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
like
 

437
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,070
like

and

440
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440
and
 

441
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,030
and
you cannot

442
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
you cannot
 

443
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,509
you cannot
kind of shortcut it you cannot uh you

444
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
kind of shortcut it you cannot uh you
 

445
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,910
kind of shortcut it you cannot uh you
cannot go around this you cannot tweak

446
00:09:59,910 --> 00:09:59,920
cannot go around this you cannot tweak
 

447
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,389
cannot go around this you cannot tweak
the network to to support this

448
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
the network to to support this
 

449
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,310
the network to to support this
if you go on uh

450
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
if you go on uh
 

451
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,910
if you go on uh
gosh uh

452
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:05,920
gosh uh
 

453
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,670
gosh uh
network explorer right now you will see

one trillion tokens
 

457
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,710
one trillion tokens
there

458
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
there
 

459
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,310
there
and this one trillion tokens basically

460
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
and this one trillion tokens basically
 

461
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,750
and this one trillion tokens basically
because with each

462
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
because with each
 

463
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,269
because with each
wallet on each repository we deposit 10

464
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279
wallet on each repository we deposit 10
 

465
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,550

and by the way they are not gauche

470
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
and by the way they are not gauche
 

471
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,990
and by the way they are not gauche
tokens okay they're just they call shell

472
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
tokens okay they're just they call shell
 

473
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,230
tokens okay they're just they call shell
stable coin tokens in the future but

474
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
stable coin tokens in the future but
 

475
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,269

right now

476
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
right now
 

477
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,430
right now
it's just it's just tokens and these

478
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
it's just it's just tokens and these
 

479
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,430
it's just it's just tokens and these
tokens are deposited automatically and

480
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
tokens are deposited automatically and
 

481
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,430
tokens are deposited automatically and
they are not um

482
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
they are not um
 

483
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,509
they are not um
they're not transferable

484
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:35,519
they're not transferable
 

485
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,590
they're not transferable
they only can pay for gauss repositories

486
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:37,600
they only can pay for gauss repositories
 

487
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,550
they only can pay for gauss repositories
and and they pay gas and and 10 000

488
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
and and they pay gas and and 10 000
 

489
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,710
and and they pay gas and and 10 000
because we need them all

490
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
because we need them all
 

491
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,110
because we need them all
so you can you can just make a

492
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
so you can you can just make a
 

493
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,350
so you can you can just make a
calculation very simply why it was from

494
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
calculation very simply why it was from
 

495
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,190
calculation very simply why it was from
this standpoint why it was absolutely

496
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
this standpoint why it was absolutely
 

497
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,110
this standpoint why it was absolutely
impossible to launch it on the main

498
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
impossible to launch it on the main

because we simply would not have enough

502
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
because we simply would not have enough
 

503
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,310
because we simply would not have enough

for all that um

506
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
for all that um
 

507
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,230
for all that um
so so

508
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
so so
 

509
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,110
so so
and you know and who would do that

510
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
and you know and who would do that
 

511
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,350
and you know and who would do that
it requires a very different set of um

512
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
it requires a very different set of um
 

513
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,350
it requires a very different set of um
tokenomic rules

514
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
tokenomic rules
 

515
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,949
tokenomic rules
uh all around

516
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
uh all around
 

517
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,430
uh all around
and the tokenomics of this network when

518
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
and the tokenomics of this network when
 

519
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,430
and the tokenomics of this network when
once it's launched

520
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
once it's launched
 

521
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,750
once it's launched
it uh it will

522
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
it uh it will
 

523
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,030
it uh it will
just be

524
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040
just be
 

525
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,990
just be
very

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,269
kind of
tuned to the to the application to the

530
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279
tuned to the to the application to the
 

531
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,630

business model of git basically

532
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,640
business model of git basically
 

533
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,590
business model of git basically
um

534
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
um
 

535
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,430
um
it will allow for example free

536
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
it will allow for example free
 

537
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,350
it will allow for example free
repositories right because that's what

538
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
repositories right because that's what
 

539
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,269
repositories right because that's what
you expect from git if your open source

540
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
you expect from git if your open source
 

541
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,509
you expect from git if your open source
repository today you you

542
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:37,519
repository today you you
 

543
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,870
repository today you you
you just deploy it

544
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
you just deploy it
 

545
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,750
you just deploy it
there

546
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:39,760
there
 

547
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,269
there
for free

548
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:41,279
for free
 

549
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,269
for free
so we need to do the same thing if we

550
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:43,279
so we need to do the same thing if we
 

551
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,829
so we need to do the same thing if we
want to be competitive in that respect

552
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
want to be competitive in that respect
 

553
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,710
want to be competitive in that respect
and

554
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:46,720
and
 

555
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,110
and
to be considered by by developers to

556
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,120
to be considered by by developers to
 

557
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,910
to be considered by by developers to
really use it

558
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920

 

559
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,150

second of all

560
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,160
second of all
 

561
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,190
second of all
again it's very experimental and and the

562
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,200
again it's very experimental and and the
 

563
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,750
again it's very experimental and and the
the requirements for git on chain

564
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:59,760
the requirements for git on chain
 

565
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,910
the requirements for git on chain
also in technical requirements for

566
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
also in technical requirements for

572
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:06,399
contracts that we
 

573
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,230
contracts that we
have seen up until now

574
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,240
have seen up until now
 

575
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,590
have seen up until now
and um

576
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
and um
 

577
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,150
and um
it also puts some

578
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
it also puts some
 

579
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,670
it also puts some
some pressure on the network in the

580
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
some pressure on the network in the
 

581
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,030
some pressure on the network in the

places where
 

583
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,870

for example the validators of gauche

uh it cost a lot of money to run this

592
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
uh it cost a lot of money to run this
 

593
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,069
uh it cost a lot of money to run this
validator uh like thousand dollars so

594
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079

595
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,269

obviously

596
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
obviously
 

597
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,030
obviously
this requirement also could not be met

598
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
this requirement also could not be met

kind of

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,470
we put really emphasis on the

00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:34,799
this part is one of the things that will
 

875
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,070
this part is one of the things that will
um

876
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,080
um
 

877
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,549
um
bring these developers into hopefully

878
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:38,559
bring these developers into hopefully
 

879
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,789
bring these developers into hopefully
into blockchain development

880
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:40,799
into blockchain development
 

881
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,430
into blockchain development
because to secure their cic descriptions

882
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
because to secure their cic descriptions
 

883
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,830
because to secure their cic descriptions
as you know cicd scripts are actually a

884
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:45,840
as you know cicd scripts are actually a
 

885
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,710
as you know cicd scripts are actually a
significant security hole right now

886
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
significant security hole right now
 

887
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,789
significant security hole right now
in the in the whole secure software

888
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799
in the in the whole secure software
 

889
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,150

paradigm

892
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:54,640
paradigm
 

893
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,029
paradigm
if we want to create a system where you

894
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039
if we want to create a system where you
 

895
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,710
if we want to create a system where you
can build the scripts using smart

896
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:58,720
can build the scripts using smart
 

897
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,350
can build the scripts using smart
contracts and then of course securing

898
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
contracts and then of course securing
 

899
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,350
contracts and then of course securing
this smart contracts

900
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
this smart contracts
 

901
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,510
this smart contracts
using you know all the all the tools

902
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:05,520
using you know all the all the tools
 

903
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,549
using you know all the all the tools
that we have

904
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:08,559

 

905
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,150

so

906
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,160
so
 

907
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,830
so
in the process

908
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840
in the process
 

909
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,510
in the process
these people these new developers will

910
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:13,520
these people these new developers will
 

911
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,350
these people these new developers will
be introduced to everscale technology

912
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,360
be introduced to everscale technology
 

913
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,630
be introduced to everscale technology
they will be introduced to everscale

914
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:16,640
they will be introduced to everscale
 

915
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,230
they will be introduced to everscale
smart contract team

916
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
smart contract team
 

917
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,310
smart contract team
and that will basically bring them to

918
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
and that will basically bring them to
 

919
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,150
and that will basically bring them to
every scale

920
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,160
every scale
 

921
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,470
every scale
um that's one thing and it's a it's a

922
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
um that's one thing and it's a it's a
 

923
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,029
um that's one thing and it's a it's a
it's a lot of developers

924
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:27,039
it's a lot of developers
 

925
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,990
it's a lot of developers
which are um you know

926
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
which are um you know
 

927
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,590
which are um you know
which are right now

00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:42,640
make that reason for them that's one
 

939
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,510
make that reason for them that's one
thing another thing more practical there

will be
 

943
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,870
will be
there will be a staking program which

gosh
that program

960
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:03,440
that program
 

961
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,470
that program
will

962
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,480
will
 

963
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,430
will
start

964
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
start
 

965
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,909
start
i think quite soon

966
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
i think quite soon
 

967
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,270
i think quite soon
actually

968
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,280
actually
 

969
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,789
actually
once we

970
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:10,799
once we
 

971
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,580
once we
are finished with the

972
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:12,590
are finished with the
 

973
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,990
are finished with the

so there will be the gauche will be

980
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720
so there will be the gauche will be
 

981
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,150
so there will be the gauche will be
connected to every scale and dominant

connected to every scale and dominant
small contracts and you can easily be

984
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:24,400
small contracts and you can easily be
 

985
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,870
small contracts and you can easily be
able to easily lock tokens here lock

986
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:26,880
able to easily lock tokens here lock

able to easily lock tokens here lock
covers here get cautious there and and

988
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
covers here get cautious there and and
 

989
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,789
covers here get cautious there and and
and just take them

990
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:32,799
and just take them
 

991
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,150
and just take them
to

992
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,160
to
 

993
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,870
to
to validate and to get rewards

994
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,880
to validate and to get rewards
 

995
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,830
to validate and to get rewards
so and i think that's not the only but

996
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:39,840
so and i think that's not the only but
 

997
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,110
so and i think that's not the only but
that's that's just the first thing that

998
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120
that's that's just the first thing that
 

999
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,950
that's that's just the first thing that
we will do

1000
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:42,960
we will do
 

1001
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,230
we will do
um

1002
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,240
um
 

1003
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,350
um
so yeah i think i think that uh

1004
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,360
so yeah i think i think that uh
 

1005
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,390
so yeah i think i think that uh
like

1006
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400
like
 

1007
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,150
like
it will bring it should bring a lot of

1008
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
it will bring it should bring a lot of
 

1009
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,270
it will bring it should bring a lot of
attention i would say to the technology

1010
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,280
attention i would say to the technology

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,310
um on any on any blockchain or on every
scale for that respect so

1050
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320
scale for that respect so
 

1051
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,669
scale for that respect so
um

1052
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679
um
 

1053
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,390
um
that might put every scale on the map

1054
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,400
that might put every scale on the map
 

1055
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,510
that might put every scale on the map
big time

1056
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:43,520
big time
 

1057
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,590
big time
in terms of like really

1058
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:45,600
in terms of like really
 

1059
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,750
in terms of like really
why it is scalable right so when

1060
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:47,760
why it is scalable right so when
 

1061
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,070
why it is scalable right so when
developers create applications

1062
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,080
developers create applications
 

1063
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,990
developers create applications
uh and every scale you can always tell

1064
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000
uh and every scale you can always tell
 

1065
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,390
uh and every scale you can always tell
them like look there is there is a whole

1066
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:54,400
them like look there is there is a whole
 

1067
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,310
them like look there is there is a whole
git work we put

1068
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,320
git work we put
 

1069
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,270
git work we put
on on that technology so yeah

1070
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
on on that technology so yeah
 

1071
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,029
on on that technology so yeah
does it answer the question i would

1072
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,039
does it answer the question i would
 

1073
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,029
does it answer the question i would
probably just add one thing is that it

1074
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:03,039
probably just add one thing is that it
 

1075
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,830
probably just add one thing is that it
can potentially the docker endorsement

1076
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:05,840
can potentially the docker endorsement
 

1077
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,149
can potentially the docker endorsement
and the product itself can potentially

1078
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:08,159
and the product itself can potentially
 

1079
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,190
and the product itself can potentially
also bring other large i.t partners into

1080
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,200
also bring other large i.t partners into
 

1081
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,510
also bring other large i.t partners into
the network or subject to feasibility

1082
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,520
the network or subject to feasibility
 

1083
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,549
the network or subject to feasibility
obviously

1084
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:14,559
obviously
 

1085
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,789
obviously
so that's probably um another another

1086
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:16,799
so that's probably um another another
 

1087
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,390
so that's probably um another another
one kind of elaborating on what you said

1088
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,400
one kind of elaborating on what you said
 

1089
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,669
one kind of elaborating on what you said
yeah so

1090
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:21,679
yeah so
 

1091
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:22,390
yeah so
yeah

1092
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,400
yeah
 

1093
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,590
yeah
i don't understand continuation

1094
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600

 

1095
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,510

uh yeah i don't understand the idea that

1096
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520
uh yeah i don't understand the idea that
 

1097
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,669
uh yeah i don't understand the idea that
uh gosh can be sort of a promo tool uh

1098
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679
uh gosh can be sort of a promo tool uh
 

1099
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,549
uh gosh can be sort of a promo tool uh
to

1100
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:34,559
to
 

1101
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,870
to
tell the developers worldwide about

1102
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
tell the developers worldwide about
 

1103
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,029
tell the developers worldwide about
every scale which technologies it's used

1104
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
every scale which technologies it's used
 

1105
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,070
every scale which technologies it's used
and okay this one is accepted and i see

1106
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,080
and okay this one is accepted and i see
 

1107
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,029
and okay this one is accepted and i see
some great potential here um maybe even

1108
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:45,039
some great potential here um maybe even
 

1109
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,510
some great potential here um maybe even
people who are not aware of blockchain

1110
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,520
people who are not aware of blockchain
 

1111
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,190
people who are not aware of blockchain
or not working with the blockchain will

1112
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,200
or not working with the blockchain will
 

1113
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,669
or not working with the blockchain will
be still aware of at some point about

1114
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:51,679
be still aware of at some point about
 

1115
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,750
be still aware of at some point about
every scale which is perfect because

1116
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760
every scale which is perfect because
 

1117
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,310
every scale which is perfect because
that community is huge and that's that's

1118
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:56,320
that community is huge and that's that's
 

1119
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,470
that community is huge and that's that's
just great things uh yet another

1120
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:58,480
just great things uh yet another
 

1121
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,870
just great things uh yet another
question that i have uh you told us that

1122
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:00,880
question that i have uh you told us that
 

1123
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,870
question that i have uh you told us that
the validators which

1124
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:02,880
the validators which
 

1125
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,990
the validators which
are running gosh uh have some pretty

1126
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000
are running gosh uh have some pretty
 

1127
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,310
are running gosh uh have some pretty
expensive uh hardware to run the network

1128
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
expensive uh hardware to run the network
 

1129
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,110
expensive uh hardware to run the network
uh and so who's paying for that pancakes

1130
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120

 

1131
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,669

we do

1132
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:17,679

 

1133
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,710

we do who else

1134
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:22,720

 

1135
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,549

uh so uh

1136
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:24,559
uh so uh
 

1137
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,909
uh so uh
at this point

1138
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:25,919
at this point
 

1139
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,750
at this point
it's like open investment from ever x

1140
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
it's like open investment from ever x
 

1141
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,510
it's like open investment from ever x
to uh

1142
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:31,520
to uh
 

1143
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,870
to uh
validate

1144
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:32,880
validate
 

1145
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,070
validate
um

1146
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
um
 

1147
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,870
um
currently the network but i might

1148
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:36,880
currently the network but i might
 

1149
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,510
currently the network but i might
presume that at some point some

1150
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:39,520
presume that at some point some
 

1151
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,830
presume that at some point some
tokenomics should be there uh and uh

1152
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:43,840
tokenomics should be there uh and uh
 

1153
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,149
tokenomics should be there uh and uh
what are your plans like you know

1154
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:46,159
what are your plans like you know
 

1155
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,630
what are your plans like you know
if at some point i would like to become

1156
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:48,640
if at some point i would like to become
 

1157
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,630
if at some point i would like to become
a validator and to earn some millions of

1158
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:52,640
a validator and to earn some millions of
 

1159
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,190
a validator and to earn some millions of
dollars yeah i just told you

1160
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,200
dollars yeah i just told you
 

1161
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,669
dollars yeah i just told you
you you will have a program

1162
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:57,679
you you will have a program
 

1163
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,510
you you will have a program
where you can lock your evers and get

1164
00:22:59,510 --> 00:22:59,520
where you can lock your evers and get
 

1165
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,950
where you can lock your evers and get
some uh gosh talking to validate

1166
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:02,960
some uh gosh talking to validate
 

1167
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,549
some uh gosh talking to validate
yeah

1168
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:04,559
yeah
 

1169
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,549
yeah
but gosh doesn't generate income gosh

1170
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:08,559
but gosh doesn't generate income gosh
 

1171
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,070
but gosh doesn't generate income gosh
doesn't generate income so gosh talking

1172
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,080
doesn't generate income so gosh talking
 

1173
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,310
doesn't generate income so gosh talking
is not like you know backed by any

1174
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,320
is not like you know backed by any
 

1175
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,549
is not like you know backed by any
business model because it's free for the

1176
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:16,559
business model because it's free for the
 

1177
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,830
business model because it's free for the
developers

1178
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:19,840

 

1179
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,710

as a github is not totally free for a

1180
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:22,720
as a github is not totally free for a
 

1181
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,830
as a github is not totally free for a
developer github actually makes money

1182
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:25,840
developer github actually makes money
 

1183
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,350
developer github actually makes money
so obviously there is a there will be a

1184
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,360
so obviously there is a there will be a
 

1185
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,350
so obviously there is a there will be a
tokenomic and the business model for

1186
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:31,360
tokenomic and the business model for
 

1187
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,149
tokenomic and the business model for
gosh it's just it's just my point was

1188
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:34,159
gosh it's just it's just my point was
 

1189
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,430
gosh it's just it's just my point was
not that

1190
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:35,440
not that
 

1191
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,110
not that
uh oh we need to have everything for

1192
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,120
uh oh we need to have everything for
 

1193
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,750
uh oh we need to have everything for
free and no that doesn't work otherwise

1194
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:39,760
free and no that doesn't work otherwise
 

1195
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,430
free and no that doesn't work otherwise
it's not a business really right it

1196
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:41,440
it's not a business really right it
 

1197
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,909
it's not a business really right it
should be sustainable

1198
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:43,919
should be sustainable
 

1199
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,230
should be sustainable
um it's simply that the business model

1200
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,240
um it's simply that the business model
 

1201
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,990
um it's simply that the business model
of the blockchains today

1202
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,000
of the blockchains today
 

1203
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,350
of the blockchains today
if you compare that with the business

1204
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,360
if you compare that with the business
 

1205
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,470
if you compare that with the business
model of

1206
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:50,480
model of
 

1207
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,430
model of
uh of course corporations like github

1208
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,440
uh of course corporations like github
 

1209
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,390
uh of course corporations like github
google and amazon and so on it's very

1210
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:56,400
google and amazon and so on it's very
 

1211
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,909
google and amazon and so on it's very
very different

1212
00:23:57,909 --> 00:23:57,919
very different
 

1213
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,630
very different
right because amazon for example and

1214
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:00,640
right because amazon for example and
 

1215
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,390
right because amazon for example and
github you can go and

1216

you know start using it for free you can
not do that with any blockchain today

1220
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:07,520
not do that with any blockchain today
 

1221
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,950
not do that with any blockchain today
and any application of the blockchain

1222

00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:13,840
there will be a tokenomic that
 

1227
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,750
there will be a tokenomic that

see
 

1233
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,350
see
how

1234
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:21,360
how
 

1235
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,350
how
the special construction economic

the special construction economic
 

1237
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,590
the special construction economic
construction allows us to do that but in

1238
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,600
construction allows us to do that but in
 

1239
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,590
construction allows us to do that but in
order to be able to build such a

1240
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:27,600
order to be able to build such a
 

1241
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,430

the tokenomics of the network should be

1244
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:31,600
the tokenomics of the network should be
 

1245
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,590
the tokenomics of the network should be
completely different from

1246
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
completely different from
 

1247
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,310
completely different from
um what it is uh what it is currently

1248
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,320
um what it is uh what it is currently
 

1249
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,710
um what it is uh what it is currently
with the blockchain

1250
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
with the blockchain
 

1251
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,789
with the blockchain
so

1252
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:40,799
so
 

1253
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,830
so
is that done yeah okay okay so

00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:43,840
is that done yeah okay okay so
 

1255
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,950
is that done yeah okay okay so
we are so we should be waiting for some

1256
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:46,960
we are so we should be waiting for some
 

1257
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,350
we are so we should be waiting for some
more detailed uh economics for gosh

1258
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,360
more detailed uh economics for gosh
 

1259
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,510
more detailed uh economics for gosh
blockchain it's yeah of course how this

1260
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:51,520
blockchain it's yeah of course how this
 

1261
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,870
blockchain it's yeah of course how this
could be profitable

1262
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
could be profitable
 

1263
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,590
could be profitable
for relevance and last but maybe not

1264
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:55,600
for relevance and last but maybe not
 

1265

the current version is sort of a test

1268
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:00,159
the current version is sort of a test
 

1269
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,510
the current version is sort of a test
version so don't bet your life on it uh

those questions to launch it as a
 

1275
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,750
those questions to launch it as a
full-scale final product uh for

1276
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:11,760
full-scale final product uh for

the two more
developers um

1280
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
developers um
 

1281
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,789
developers um
to be afraid of

1282
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:16,799
to be afraid of

we're aiming for three months process

1284
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,240
we're aiming for three months process
 

1285
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,870
we're aiming for three months process
our aim is three months again don't

1286
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:22,880
our aim is three months again don't
 

1287
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,110
our aim is three months again don't
just take my words and say okay he said

1288
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,120
just take my words and say okay he said
 

1289
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,909
just take my words and say okay he said
three months no i said our aim is three

1290
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:27,919
three months no i said our aim is three
 

1291
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,230
three months no i said our aim is three
months so we internally think that it is

1292
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,240
months so we internally think that it is
 

1293
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,230
months so we internally think that it is
possible within three months

1294
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,240
possible within three months
 

1295
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,269
possible within three months
uh if nothing wrong happens so it's

1296
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:35,279
uh if nothing wrong happens so it's
 

1297
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,470
uh if nothing wrong happens so it's
september

1303
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,590

you can use it again we use this three

1304
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
you can use it again we use this three
 

1305
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,350
you can use it again we use this three
months to collect feedback from

1306
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,360
months to collect feedback from
 

1307
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,269
months to collect feedback from
developers that starts to use it we

1308
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:51,279
developers that starts to use it we
 

1309
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,909
developers that starts to use it we
actually have a like a program

1310
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:53,919
actually have a like a program
 

1311
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,590
actually have a like a program
um a marketing program which um which

1312
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:57,600
um a marketing program which um which
 

1313
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,630
um a marketing program which um which
involves

1314
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
involves
 

1315
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,870
involves
some questionnaires

1316
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:00,880
some questionnaires
 

1317
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,630
some questionnaires
and some interviews that we're

1318
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
and some interviews that we're
 

1319
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,870
and some interviews that we're
conducting with developers

1320
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:04,880
conducting with developers
 

1321
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,830
conducting with developers
um and then developers use it and we

1322
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:07,840
um and then developers use it and we
 

1323
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,430
um and then developers use it and we
conduct an interview with them again and

1324
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:09,440
conduct an interview with them again and
 

1325
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,190
conduct an interview with them again and
so on and so forth so there is a process

1326
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,200
so on and so forth so there is a process
 

1327
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,029
so on and so forth so there is a process
of feedback loop which we are creating

1328
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:13,039
of feedback loop which we are creating
 

1329
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,789
of feedback loop which we are creating
now between the developers what they

1330
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:14,799
now between the developers what they
 

1331
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,269
now between the developers what they
want to see from you know kit on chain

1332
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:17,279
want to see from you know kit on chain
 

1333
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,510
want to see from you know kit on chain
because obviously it has a different

1334
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:19,520
because obviously it has a different
 

1335
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,269
because obviously it has a different
functionality apart from the basic

1336
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:21,279
functionality apart from the basic
 

1337
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,029
functionality apart from the basic
functionality of git

1338
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,039
functionality of git
 

1339
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,710
functionality of git
because it's on chain

1340
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:24,720
because it's on chain
 

1341
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,789
because it's on chain

test of some sort of a drive chain that

1404
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:37,200
test of some sort of a drive chain that
 

1405
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,149
test of some sort of a drive chain that
we'll be seeing on every scale

1406
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:40,159
we'll be seeing on every scale
 

1407
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,870
we'll be seeing on every scale
drive chain no the gauge does not have

development is in progress and it's in

1412
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:46,240
development is in progress and it's in
 

1413
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,830
development is in progress and it's in
parallel and the direction will be

1414
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:47,840
parallel and the direction will be
 

1415
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,669

introduced in both gaussian errors

1416
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:49,679
introduced in both gaussian errors
 

1417
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,990

memory scale actually every technology

1418
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,000
memory scale actually every technology
 

1419
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,909
memory scale actually every technology
we're doing is introduced everywhere

1420
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:53,919
we're doing is introduced everywhere
 

1421
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,669
we're doing is introduced everywhere
right so it's the same

1422
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:55,679
right so it's the same
 

1423
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,350
right so it's the same
thing maybe that's important also to

1424
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:57,360
thing maybe that's important also to
 

1425
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,190
thing maybe that's important also to
mention

1426
00:27:59,190 --> 00:27:59,200
mention
 

1427
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,190
mention
that apart from the application itself

1428
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,200
that apart from the application itself

some tricks like that

1432
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:05,440
some tricks like that
 

1433
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,549
some tricks like that
every

1434
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:06,559
every
 

1435
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,830
every
thing we do on the core level is shared

1436
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:09,840
thing we do on the core level is shared
 

1437
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,990
thing we do on the core level is shared
so basically it's just one code we don't

1438
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,000
so basically it's just one code we don't
 

1439
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,669
so basically it's just one code we don't
run any other

1440
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:13,679
run any other
 

1441
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,630
run any other
code in terms of

1442
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:16,640
code in terms of
 

1443
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,630
code in terms of
like the the basic the knowledge yeah i

1444
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:18,640
like the the basic the knowledge yeah i
 

1445
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,590
like the the basic the knowledge yeah i
just thought that gosh uh

1446
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:21,600
just thought that gosh uh
 

1447
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,669
just thought that gosh uh
i just thought that gauche stores uh the

1448
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:23,679
i just thought that gauche stores uh the
 

1449
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:24,630
i just thought that gauche stores uh the
data

1450
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:24,640
data
 

1451
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,230
data
on the blockchain and it's uh sort of it

1452
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:28,240
on the blockchain and it's uh sort of it
 

1453
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,230
on the blockchain and it's uh sort of it
does uh an implementation of the

1454
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,240
does uh an implementation of the
 

1455
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,430
does uh an implementation of the
direction

1456
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:31,440
direction
 

1457
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,630
direction
it does not it does store on the on the

1458
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:34,640
it does not it does store on the on the
 

1459
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,830
it does not it does store on the on the
the the large blobs um

1460
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:37,840
the the large blobs um
 

1461
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,909
the the large blobs um
are stored on actually in ipfs right now

1462
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:39,919
are stored on actually in ipfs right now
 

1463
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,190
are stored on actually in ipfs right now
they will be moved to drivetrain when

1464
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,200
they will be moved to drivetrain when
 

1465
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,510
they will be moved to drivetrain when
it's ready but right now the large blobs

1466
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:43,520
it's ready but right now the large blobs
 

1467
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,669
it's ready but right now the large blobs
of like binary files are stored in ideas

1468
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:47,679
of like binary files are stored in ideas
 

1469
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,350
of like binary files are stored in ideas
and they in the uh

1470
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:49,360
and they in the uh
 

1471
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,029
and they in the uh
so okay so

1472
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:51,039
so okay so
 

1473
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,590
so okay so
this isn't

1474
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:53,600

 

1475
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,029

so so the the the draft chain is uh i

1476
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:57,039
so so the the the draft chain is uh i
 

1477
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,110
so so the the the draft chain is uh i
think yet to be implemented both on

1478
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,120
think yet to be implemented both on
 

1479
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,029
think yet to be implemented both on
gaussian for both yes exactly we would

1480
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:01,039
gaussian for both yes exactly we would
 

1481
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,870
gaussian for both yes exactly we would
not we would not implement something on

1482
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:02,880
not we would not implement something on
 

1483
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,470
not we would not implement something on
the gosh and would not implement it on

1484
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:04,480
the gosh and would not implement it on
 

1485
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,149
the gosh and would not implement it on
ever scale that doesn't because we don't

1486
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:06,159
ever scale that doesn't because we don't
 

1487
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,750
ever scale that doesn't because we don't
have resources actually to support two

1488
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:07,760
have resources actually to support two
 

1489
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,710
have resources actually to support two
parallel developments uh like that so

1490
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:10,720
parallel developments uh like that so
 

1491
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,789
parallel developments uh like that so
it's just one core team that develops

1492
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:12,799
it's just one core team that develops
 

1493
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,029
it's just one core team that develops
one core functionality for for the same

1494
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:15,039
one core functionality for for the same
 

1495
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,190
one core functionality for for the same
like network for the same core

1496
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,200
like network for the same core
 

1497
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,310
like network for the same core
so drivetrain will be introduced to

1498
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:20,320
so drivetrain will be introduced to
 

1499
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,389
so drivetrain will be introduced to
every network

1500
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:24,399

 

1501
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,549

okay that's all thank you michael for

1502
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:26,559
okay that's all thank you michael for
 

1503
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,149
okay that's all thank you michael for
all your questions those are some really

1504
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:28,159
all your questions those are some really
 

1505
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,389
all your questions those are some really
great questions i saw that it also

1506
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:30,399
great questions i saw that it also
 

1507
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,070
great questions i saw that it also
covered some of the

1508
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,080
covered some of the
 

1509
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,630
covered some of the
ones popping up in youtube i have a

1510
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:34,640
ones popping up in youtube i have a
 

1511
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,630
ones popping up in youtube i have a
concern from the

1512
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:36,640
concern from the
 

1513
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,430
concern from the
uh from the community is what happens if

1514
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:39,440
uh from the community is what happens if
 

1515
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,750
uh from the community is what happens if
gosh takes off what will everex's

1516
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:41,760
gosh takes off what will everex's
 

1517
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,029
gosh takes off what will everex's
priority be

1518
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:43,039
priority be
 

1519
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,510
priority be
um if it's a separate chain

1520
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:45,520
um if it's a separate chain
 

1521
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,110
um if it's a separate chain
would every scale be sidelined

1522
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,120

 

1523
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,549

as i said

1524
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:50,559
as i said
 

1525
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,549
as i said
the the development of the core the core

1526
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:52,559
the the development of the core the core
 

1527
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,470
the the development of the core the core
technology is the same so in what

1528
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:54,480
technology is the same so in what
 

1529
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,710
technology is the same so in what
respect it would be sidelined

1530
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:56,720
respect it would be sidelined
 

1531
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,909
respect it would be sidelined
um

1532
00:29:57,909 --> 00:29:57,919
um
 

1533
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,230
um
i think they feel that

1534
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,240
i think they feel that
 

1535
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,750
i think they feel that
the team's uh focus will move to gosh

1536
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:03,760
the team's uh focus will move to gosh
 

1537
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,590
the team's uh focus will move to gosh
it's it's a feeling that

1538
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:05,600
it's it's a feeling that
 

1539
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,830
it's it's a feeling that
it doesn't matter where

1540
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:07,840
it doesn't matter where
 

1541
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,510
it doesn't matter where
focus on gauche is the same focus as the

1542
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:09,520
focus on gauche is the same focus as the
 

1543
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,669
focus on gauche is the same focus as the
noir scale there's simply exactly the

1544
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:11,679
noir scale there's simply exactly the
 

1545
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,110
noir scale there's simply exactly the
same technology

1546
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,120
same technology
 

1547
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,789
same technology
exactly the same code

1548
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:14,799
exactly the same code
 

1549
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,549
exactly the same code
uh and if we introduce something for

1550
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,559
uh and if we introduce something for
 

1551
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,789
uh and if we introduce something for
gosh it means we introduce it forever

1552
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:18,799
gosh it means we introduce it forever
 

1553
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,710
gosh it means we introduce it forever
scale and if we introduce something for

1554
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:20,720
scale and if we introduce something for
 

1555
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,630
scale and if we introduce something for
gosh or on everscale it means

1556
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:22,640
gosh or on everscale it means
 

1557
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,950
gosh or on everscale it means
that you can use it to develop such

1558
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:24,960
that you can use it to develop such
 

1559
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,510
that you can use it to develop such
application as gosh neverscale meaning

1560
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:27,520
application as gosh neverscale meaning
 

1561
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,110
application as gosh neverscale meaning
um i don't know it's for example

1562
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,120
um i don't know it's for example
 

1563
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,029
um i don't know it's for example
there will be i don't know drivetrain

1564
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:33,039
there will be i don't know drivetrain
 

1565
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,950
there will be i don't know drivetrain
for example drivetrain is great for nfcs

1566
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:34,960
for example drivetrain is great for nfcs
 

1567
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,950
for example drivetrain is great for nfcs
and great for many things that that

1568
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:36,960
and great for many things that that
 

1569
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,110
and great for many things that that
needed in both this and that so i mean

1570
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,120
needed in both this and that so i mean
 

1571
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,029
needed in both this and that so i mean
what kind of thing we could develop in

1572
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:43,039
what kind of thing we could develop in
 

1573
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,430
what kind of thing we could develop in
gosh is a focus on gosh what kind of

1574
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:45,440
gosh is a focus on gosh what kind of
 

1575
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,789
gosh is a focus on gosh what kind of
thing would development gaussian would

1576
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:46,799
thing would development gaussian would
 

1577
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,470
thing would development gaussian would
not take any

1578
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:48,480
not take any
 

1579
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,510
not take any
um unless it needs or

1580
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:51,520
um unless it needs or
 

1581
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,669
um unless it needs or
use in every step i don't i don't know

1582
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:53,679
use in every step i don't i don't know
 

1583
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,149
use in every step i don't i don't know
any of that i don't know any any such

1584
00:30:56,149 --> 00:30:56,159
any of that i don't know any any such
 

1585
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,750
any of that i don't know any any such
technologies

1586
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:57,760
technologies
 

1587
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,710
technologies
okay i just don't see that as a

1588
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:00,720
okay i just don't see that as a
 

1589
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,190
okay i just don't see that as a
like

1590
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,200

 

1591
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,750

that's the thing or would we just uh let

1592
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:05,760
that's the thing or would we just uh let
 

1593
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,549
that's the thing or would we just uh let
every scale fall uh if something stops i

1594
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:08,559
every scale fall uh if something stops i
 

1595
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,789
every scale fall uh if something stops i
don't know i i think yeah i think some

1596
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:10,799
don't know i i think yeah i think some
 

1597
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,590
don't know i i think yeah i think some
people are concerned you have to

1598
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:11,600
people are concerned you have to
 

1599
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,669
people are concerned you have to
remember we have a lot of tokens we have

1600
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:13,679
remember we have a lot of tokens we have
 

1601
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,230
remember we have a lot of tokens we have
a lot of tokens on our scale right so

1602
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,240
a lot of tokens on our scale right so
 

1603
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:16,830
a lot of tokens on our scale right so
i

1604
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:16,840
i
 

1605
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,509
i
mean so you're not abandoning abandoning

1606
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:19,519
mean so you're not abandoning abandoning
 

1607
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,029
mean so you're not abandoning abandoning
billions of tokens

1608
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:21,039
billions of tokens
 

1609
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,430
billions of tokens
exactly billions do we have billions of

1610
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:23,440
exactly billions do we have billions of
 

1611
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,630
exactly billions do we have billions of
tokens

00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:26,240
throwing it out there
 

1615
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,909
throwing it out there
with everything combined i see

1616
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:29,919
with everything combined i see
 

1617
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,750
with everything combined i see
okay uh we have a question about

1618
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:31,760
okay uh we have a question about
 

1619
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,430
okay uh we have a question about
liquidity pools that were quickly

1620
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:33,440
liquidity pools that were quickly
 

1621
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,070
liquidity pools that were quickly
mentioned um when it was

1622
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,080
mentioned um when it was
 

1623
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,269
mentioned um when it was
announced

1624
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:37,279
announced
 

1625
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,029
announced
tell us about the additional liquidity

1626
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
tell us about the additional liquidity
 

1627
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,350
tell us about the additional liquidity
pools on everscale with gosh tokens that

1628
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,360
pools on everscale with gosh tokens that
 

1629
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,909
pools on everscale with gosh tokens that
was mentioned and we'll all take these

1630
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:43,919
was mentioned and we'll all take these
 

1631
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,230
was mentioned and we'll all take these
staking calls yeah yeah

1632
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:46,240
staking calls yeah yeah
 

1633
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,070
staking calls yeah yeah
well that that will be as i said the

1634
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,080
well that that will be as i said the
 

1635
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,509
well that that will be as i said the
third time

1636
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:49,519
third time
 

1637
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,990
third time
you will be able to lock your everest

you will be able to lock your everest
 

1639
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,190
you will be able to lock your everest
in the pools

1640

the rewards i can just give you

1648
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:05,279
the rewards i can just give you
 

1649
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:05,990

the gosh rewards rewards on gosh network

1654
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,120
the gosh rewards rewards on gosh network
 

1655
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,310
the gosh rewards rewards on gosh network
are not from transaction fees and they

1656
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:14,320
are not from transaction fees and they
 

1657
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,430
are not from transaction fees and they
are not from block creation fees so

1658
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:17,440
are not from block creation fees so
 

1659
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,230
are not from block creation fees so
because that's infeasible for such a

00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:32,640
have a reward
 

1671
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,350
have a reward
in terms of the stake reward like a

1672
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:35,360
in terms of the stake reward like a
 

1673
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,909
in terms of the stake reward like a
financial reward

financial reward
 

1675
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,230
financial reward
like you do in farming basically you

1676
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:40,240
like you do in farming basically you
 

1677
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,430
like you do in farming basically you
lock you validate and by that you get

1678
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:43,440
lock you validate and by that you get
 

1679
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,669
lock you validate and by that you get
rewards in tokens

that's it

1682
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:46,799
that's it
 

1683
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,870
that's it
it's not paid for blocks it's not paid

you lock your tokens
in if you don't lock your tokens you can

2215
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,430
thank you uh we have a question from
elia what are the plans to solve the

2216
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:49,440
elia what are the plans to solve the
 

2217
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,829
elia what are the plans to solve the
problem of a very slow user interface

2218
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:51,839
problem of a very slow user interface
 

2219
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,910
problem of a very slow user interface
and why does everything work on a fast

2220
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:53,920
and why does everything work on a fast
 

2221
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,030
and why does everything work on a fast
scalable blockchain like on ethereum

2222
00:42:59,030 --> 00:42:59,040

 

2223
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,069

it's it's the first version um

2224
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:02,079
it's it's the first version um
 

2225
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:02,640
it's it's the first version um
so yeah

2226
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:02,650
so yeah
 

2227
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,309
so yeah
[Music]

2228
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:04,319
[Music]
 

2229
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,589
[Music]
there are some

2230
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:05,599
there are some
 

2231
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,109
there are some
there are some

2232
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:07,119
there are some
 

2233
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,430
there are some
things that are not done yet once we're

2234
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:09,440
things that are not done yet once we're
 

2235
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,030
things that are not done yet once we're
done

2236
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:11,040
done
 

2237
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,510
done
it um

2238
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:13,520
it um
 

2239
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,750
it um
you know it it will be

2240
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:15,760
you know it it will be
 

2241
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,470
you know it it will be
of course it will be slower

2242
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:18,480
of course it will be slower
 

2243
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,349
of course it will be slower
than

2244
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:19,359
than
 

2245
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,550
than
uh just put that in the central server

2246
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:22,560
uh just put that in the central server
 

2247
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,349
uh just put that in the central server
simply yeah because we put it in several

2248
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:25,359
simply yeah because we put it in several
 

2249
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,150
simply yeah because we put it in several
servers so it's kind of slower

2250
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:28,160
servers so it's kind of slower
 

2251
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,230
servers so it's kind of slower
but it in the end it won't be

2252
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:30,240
but it in the end it won't be
 

2253
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,870
but it in the end it won't be
significantly slower so it won't affect

2254
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:32,880
significantly slower so it won't affect
 

2255
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,430
significantly slower so it won't affect
your work uh like

2256
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:35,440
your work uh like
 

2257
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,670
your work uh like
completely of course when you

2258
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:37,680
completely of course when you
 

2259
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,109
completely of course when you
upload like

2260
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:39,119
upload like
 

2261
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,550
upload like
will upload like linux kind of

2262
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:40,560
will upload like linux kind of
 

2263
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,790
will upload like linux kind of
repository then

2264
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:42,800
repository then
 

2265
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,950
repository then
you know it it may take some time to do

2266
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:44,960
you know it it may take some time to do
 

2267
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,630
you know it it may take some time to do
that if you upload it hold it with all

2268
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:46,640
that if you upload it hold it with all
 

2269
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,230
that if you upload it hold it with all
the 80

2270
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:48,240
the 80
 

2271
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,109
the 80
million

2272
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:49,119
million
 

2273
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,230
million
uh

2274
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:50,240
uh
 

2275
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,150
uh
you know objects that they have there so

2276
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:52,160
you know objects that they have there so
 

2277
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,550
you know objects that they have there so
it will take some time but uh yeah and

2278
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:54,560
it will take some time but uh yeah and
 

2279
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,230
it will take some time but uh yeah and
um

2280
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:56,240
um
 

2281
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,589
um
apart from that

2282
00:43:57,589 --> 00:43:57,599
apart from that
 

2283
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,069
apart from that
it is obvious that all the

2284
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:00,079
it is obvious that all the
 

2285
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,190
it is obvious that all the
kind of

2286
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:01,200
kind of
 

2287
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,710
kind of
um

2288
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:02,720
um
 

2289
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,230
um
improvements that were made to the core

2290
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:04,240
improvements that were made to the core
 

2291
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,430
improvements that were made to the core
network right now on everscale uh for

2292
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:07,440
network right now on everscale uh for
 

2293
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,910
network right now on everscale uh for
improving latency and improving finality

2294
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:09,920
improving latency and improving finality
 

2295
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,510
improving latency and improving finality
and all of this stuff

2296
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:11,520
and all of this stuff
 

2297
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,190
and all of this stuff
very well

2298
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:13,200
very well
 

2299
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,990
very well
needed and applied to gosh as well so

2300
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:16,000
needed and applied to gosh as well so
 

2301
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,349
needed and applied to gosh as well so
to the question

2302
00:44:17,349 --> 00:44:17,359
to the question
 

2303
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,950
to the question
you know if we develop the same thing

2304
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
you know if we develop the same thing
 

2305
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,190
you know if we develop the same thing
yeah we need we need all of us need the

2306
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:21,200
yeah we need we need all of us need the
 

2307
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,030
yeah we need we need all of us need the
same things basically

2308
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:23,040
same things basically
 

2309
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,349
same things basically
so we're working on that as well

2310
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:25,359
so we're working on that as well
 

2311
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,190
so we're working on that as well
but right now it's just not optimized

2312
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:27,200
but right now it's just not optimized
 

2313
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,190
but right now it's just not optimized
enough so there's a lot of optimizations

2314
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:29,200
enough so there's a lot of optimizations
 

2315
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,950
enough so there's a lot of optimizations
coming within this three months to make

2316
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:30,960
coming within this three months to make
 

2317
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,589
coming within this three months to make
it faster

2318
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:33,599
it faster
 

2319
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,270
it faster
okay great

2320
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:35,280
okay great
 

2321
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,990
okay great
uh next question is it recommended to

2322
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:38,000
uh next question is it recommended to
 

2323
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,910
uh next question is it recommended to
run gosh on a layer two and then

2324
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:39,920
run gosh on a layer two and then
 

2325
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,750
run gosh on a layer two and then
finalize on chain on a timed basis no

2326
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:43,760
finalize on chain on a timed basis no
 

2327
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,309
finalize on chain on a timed basis no
yeah we're we're against l2 solutions as

2328
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:46,319
yeah we're we're against l2 solutions as
 

2329
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:50,309
yeah we're we're against l2 solutions as
you know and i i went lengthy into that

2330
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:50,319
you know and i i went lengthy into that
 

2331
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,910
you know and i i went lengthy into that
in the white paper i don't want to

2332
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:51,920
in the white paper i don't want to
 

2333
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,430
in the white paper i don't want to
repeat that

2334
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:53,440
repeat that
 

2335
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,870
repeat that
l2 sucks

2336
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:54,880
l2 sucks
 

2337
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,069
l2 sucks
big time

2338
00:44:58,069 --> 00:44:58,079

 

2339
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,030

okay

2340
00:44:59,030 --> 00:44:59,040
okay
 

2341
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,829
okay
and the next question is are there any

2342
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:01,839
and the next question is are there any
 

2343
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,630
and the next question is are there any
plans to integrate gosh economics into

2344
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:04,640
plans to integrate gosh economics into
 

2345
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,349
plans to integrate gosh economics into
everscale or technology promotion and

2346
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:07,359
everscale or technology promotion and
 

2347
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,190
everscale or technology promotion and
stacking of evers

2348
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:09,200
stacking of evers
 

2349
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,750
stacking of evers
that all about synergy between gosh and

2350
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:11,760
that all about synergy between gosh and
 

2351
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,589
that all about synergy between gosh and
everscale

2352
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:13,599
everscale
 

2353
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,829
everscale
there is a plan to

2354
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:15,839
there is a plan to
 

2355
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,670
there is a plan to
not a plan but i would say there is a

2356
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:17,680
not a plan but i would say there is a
 

2357
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,589
not a plan but i would say there is a
possibility

2358
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:19,599
possibility
 

2359
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,309
possibility
once there the whole stack is ready for

2360
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:22,319
once there the whole stack is ready for
 

2361
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,710
once there the whole stack is ready for
this we can

2362
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:24,720
this we can
 

2363
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,870
this we can
we can think about adding gauche as a

2364
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:28,880
we can think about adding gauche as a
 

2365
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,470
we can think about adding gauche as a
as a work chain to turbo scale but right

2366
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:32,480
as a work chain to turbo scale but right
 

2367
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,309
as a work chain to turbo scale but right
now

2368
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:34,319
now
 

2369
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,870
now
it's it's not possible technology

2370
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:36,880
it's it's not possible technology
 

2371
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,069
it's it's not possible technology
technically

2372
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:38,079
technically
 

2373
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,990
technically
currently because you because you will

2374
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,000
currently because you because you will
 

2375
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,030
currently because you because you will
need to

2376
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:41,040
need to
 

2377
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,230
need to
have

2378
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:42,240
have
 

2379
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,589
have
a work chain that um

2380
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:45,599
a work chain that um
 

2381
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,990
a work chain that um
the the pay gas in its own

2382
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:48,000
the the pay gas in its own
 

2383
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,870
the the pay gas in its own
currency so and so it's it's not ready

2384
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:50,880
currency so and so it's it's not ready
 

2385
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,030
currency so and so it's it's not ready
yet once it's ready once we can do

2386
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:53,040
yet once it's ready once we can do
 

2387
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,870
yet once it's ready once we can do
something like that we can think about

2388
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:54,880
something like that we can think about
 

2389
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,309
something like that we can think about
bringing gosh

2390
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:56,319
bringing gosh
 

2391
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,309
bringing gosh
into every scale as a work chain but

2392
00:45:58,309 --> 00:45:58,319
into every scale as a work chain but
 

2393
00:45:58,319 --> 00:45:59,910
into every scale as a work chain but
it's required anyway it will require the

2394
00:45:59,910 --> 00:45:59,920
it's required anyway it will require the
 

2395
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,150
it's required anyway it will require the
same set of validators so more or less

2396
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:02,160
same set of validators so more or less
 

2397
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:07,109
same set of validators so more or less
the same thing right

2398
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:07,119

 

2399
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,430

so does it really matter if you look to

2400
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:09,440
so does it really matter if you look to
 

2401
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,430
so does it really matter if you look to
validate you will still lock the evers

2402
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:11,440
validate you will still lock the evers
 

2403
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,430
validate you will still lock the evers
it's almost the same okay

2404
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:15,440
it's almost the same okay
 

2405
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,990
it's almost the same okay
okay next question if everyone can use

2406
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:18,000
okay next question if everyone can use
 

2407
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,630
okay next question if everyone can use
gosh for free what's the business model

2408
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:20,640
gosh for free what's the business model
 

2409
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,670
gosh for free what's the business model
will there be a special feature for uh

2410
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:23,680
will there be a special feature for uh
 

2411
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,470
will there be a special feature for uh
paying repos yes there will be there

2412
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:26,480
paying repos yes there will be there
 

2413
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,270
paying repos yes there will be there
will be

2414
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:27,280
will be
 

2415
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,829
will be
paid features very simply

2416
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:29,839
paid features very simply
 

2417
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,150
paid features very simply
but the stock economics allow us to do

2418
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:32,160
but the stock economics allow us to do
 

2419
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,470
but the stock economics allow us to do
the tiered approach so we can have a

2420
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:34,480
the tiered approach so we can have a
 

2421
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,550
the tiered approach so we can have a
tier which is free

2422
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:36,560
tier which is free
 

2423
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,630
tier which is free
and then we can start introducing some

2424
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:38,640
and then we can start introducing some
 

2425
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,910
and then we can start introducing some
some paid

2426
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:39,920
some paid
 

2427
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,990
some paid

okay um will drive chain follow the same

2432
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:49,839
okay um will drive chain follow the same
 

2433
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,829
okay um will drive chain follow the same
logic of separate business separate

um
 

2441
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,390
um
no the drive chain is is the whole point

2442
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:58,400
no the drive chain is is the whole point
 

2443
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,390
no the drive chain is is the whole point
of dry chain drive chain is being a work

2444
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:00,400
of dry chain drive chain is being a work
 

2445
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,630
of dry chain drive chain is being a work
chain so it will be drive chain work

2446
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:02,640
chain so it will be drive chain work
 

2447
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,150
chain so it will be drive chain work
chain or never scale that would drive

2448
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:04,160

chain work chain on gosh
 

2451
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,069
chain work chain on gosh
and they both have

2452
00:47:08,069 --> 00:47:08,079
and they both have
 

2453
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,870
and they both have
uh their business model and then i'm

2454
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:10,880
uh their business model and then i'm
 

2455
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,150
uh their business model and then i'm
sure there will be different business

2456
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:12,160
sure there will be different business
 

2457
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,430
sure there will be different business
models on every scale it will follow the

2458
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:15,440
models on every scale it will follow the
 

2459
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,230
models on every scale it will follow the
some

2460
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:16,240
some
 

2461
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,950
some
you know economics of the of the of the

2462
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:18,960
you know economics of the of the of the
 

2463
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,750
you know economics of the of the of the
um

2464
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:19,760
um
 

2465
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,589
um
of the drive chain

2466
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:21,599
of the drive chain
 

2467
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,549
of the drive chain
whatever it will be and on gosh it will

2468
00:47:24,549 --> 00:47:24,559
whatever it will be and on gosh it will
 

2469
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:25,670
whatever it will be and on gosh it will
follow this

2470
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:25,680
follow this
 

2471
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,589
follow this
again tiered approach because

2472
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:27,599
again tiered approach because
 

2473
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,349
again tiered approach because
same thing you need to

2474
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:29,359
same thing you need to
 

2475
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,150
same thing you need to
it doesn't matter what the object sizes

2476
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:32,160
it doesn't matter what the object sizes
 

2477
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,670
it doesn't matter what the object sizes
that you store in the

2478
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:33,680
that you store in the
 

2479
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,510
that you store in the
open source repository it should be free

2480
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:35,520
open source repository it should be free
 

2481
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,270
open source repository it should be free
right

2482
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:37,280
right
 

2483
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,870
right
so there will be different business

2484
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:38,880
so there will be different business
 

2485
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,790
so there will be different business
models they're just it's just not

2486
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:40,800
models they're just it's just not
 

2487
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,870
models they're just it's just not
compatible

2488
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:42,880
compatible
 

2489
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,030
compatible
but but each of them will have its own

2490
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:45,040
but but each of them will have its own
 

2491
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,109
but but each of them will have its own
business model of course

2492
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:47,119
business model of course
 

2493
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:48,950
business model of course
okay

2494
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:48,960
okay
 

2495
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,109
okay
uh would it be possible to run regular

2496
00:47:51,109 --> 00:47:51,119
uh would it be possible to run regular
 

2497
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,670
uh would it be possible to run regular
smart contracts for free on gosh or can

2498
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:53,680
smart contracts for free on gosh or can
 

2499
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,430

you only use shell for specific

2500
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:55,440
you only use shell for specific
 

2501
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,349
you only use shell for specific
contracts no

2502
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:57,359
contracts no
 

2503
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,030
contracts no
no you can use shell for any contract

2504
00:47:59,030 --> 00:47:59,040
no you can use shell for any contract
 

2505
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,349
no you can use shell for any contract
but you won't be able to run them for

2506
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:01,359
but you won't be able to run them for
 

2507
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,910
but you won't be able to run them for
free

2508
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:03,920

 

2509
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,670

so okay the free use is only for gosh

2510
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:07,680
so okay the free use is only for gosh
 

2511
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,270
so okay the free use is only for gosh
repositories

2512
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:09,280
repositories
 

2513
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,349
repositories
if you want to build your smart contract

2514
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:11,359
if you want to build your smart contract
 

2515
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,670
if you want to build your smart contract
on gosh apart from this repositories

2516
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:13,680
on gosh apart from this repositories
 

2517
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,750
on gosh apart from this repositories
then you need to pay for it

2518
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:15,760
then you need to pay for it
 

2519
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,230
then you need to pay for it
which is logical i think

2520
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:20,240

 

2521
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,870

okay um kind of struggling with the next

2522
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:22,880
okay um kind of struggling with the next
 

2523
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,710
okay um kind of struggling with the next
question uh

2524
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:24,720
question uh
 

2525
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,870
question uh
we make rename from

2526
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:26,880

great

2590
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:38,720
great

00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,870
like think when you have
two networks for the same design

2594

two networks for the same design
 

2595
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,549
two networks for the same design
now you can do that actually because you

2596
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:44,559
now you can do that actually because you
 

2597
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,470
now you can do that actually because you
can prove things on one network to

2598
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:46,480
can prove things on one network to
 

2599
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,109
can prove things on one network to
another with the same kind of

2600
00:49:49,109 --> 00:49:49,119
another with the same kind of
 

2601
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:49,990

explain the principles
of uh the realization of tokenomics in

2718
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:56,400
of uh the realization of tokenomics in
 

2719
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,390
of uh the realization of tokenomics in
russian i think that probably that would

2720
00:51:58,390 --> 00:51:58,400
russian i think that probably that would
 

2721
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,670
russian i think that probably that would
have to happen

2722
00:51:59,670 --> 00:51:59,680
have to happen
 

2723
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,549
have to happen
uh in a separate session announcement or

2724
00:52:02,549 --> 00:52:02,559
uh in a separate session announcement or
 

2725

00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:21,520
i i we had people crashing inside
 

2801
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,950
i i we had people crashing inside
meetings

2802
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:22,960
meetings
 

2803
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:23,910
meetings
like

2804
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:23,920
like
 

2805
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,589
like
crushing falling asleep within a meeting

2806
00:53:27,589 --> 00:53:27,599
crushing falling asleep within a meeting
 

2807
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,790
crushing falling asleep within a meeting
so no it would didn't it couldn't be

2808
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:30,800
so no it would didn't it couldn't be
 

2809
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,790
so no it would didn't it couldn't be
done

2810
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:32,800
done
 

2811
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,870
done
we have two more questions

2812
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:34,880
we have two more questions
 

2813
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,549
we have two more questions
i think it got skipped

2814
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:36,559
i think it got skipped
 

2815
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:37,910
i think it got skipped
uh

2816
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:37,920
uh
 

2817
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,430
uh
how would the docker verification

2818
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:39,440
how would the docker verification
 

2819
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,750
how would the docker verification
extension work i mean how how to compile

2820
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:41,760
extension work i mean how how to compile
 

2821
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,390
extension work i mean how how to compile
the code you need a compiler but

2822
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:44,400
the code you need a compiler but
 

2823
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,230
the code you need a compiler but
how do you get verified compiled

2824
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:46,240
how do you get verified compiled
 

2825
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,390
how do you get verified compiled
compiler

2826
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:48,400
compiler
 

2827
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,190
compiler
uh

2828
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:49,200
uh
 

2829
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,270
uh
okay it doesn't it doesn't work like

2830
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:51,280
okay it doesn't it doesn't work like
 

2831
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,549
okay it doesn't it doesn't work like
that so

2832
00:53:52,549 --> 00:53:52,559
that so
 

2833
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:57,030
that so
it's it's um

2834
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:57,040

 

2835
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,990

uh you build um

2836
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:00,000
uh you build um
 

2837
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,910
uh you build um
you don't need to verify the compiler

2838
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:01,920
you don't need to verify the compiler
 

2839
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,750
you don't need to verify the compiler
it's more or less what we do with the

2840
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:03,760
it's more or less what we do with the
 

2841
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,790
it's more or less what we do with the
formal verification so you

2842
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:06,800
formal verification so you
 

2843
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,309
formal verification so you
uh you build

2844
00:54:08,309 --> 00:54:08,319
uh you build
 

2845
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:09,109
uh you build
the

2846
00:54:09,109 --> 00:54:09,119
the
 

2847
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,069
the
you build in the docker build

2848
00:54:12,069 --> 00:54:12,079
you build in the docker build
 

2849
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,950
you build in the docker build
um you build the the container you build

2850
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:14,960
um you build the the container you build
 

2851
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,150
um you build the the container you build
the image

2852
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:16,160
the image
 

2853
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,950
the image
then you create an artifact and put the

2854
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:18,960
then you create an artifact and put the
 

2855
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,309
then you create an artifact and put the
image metadata on chain

2856
00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:22,319
image metadata on chain
 

2857
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:23,349
image metadata on chain
and then

2858
00:54:23,349 --> 00:54:23,359
and then
 

2859
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,950
and then
you launch that in the docker desktop

2860
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:26,960
you launch that in the docker desktop
 

2861
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,510
you launch that in the docker desktop
you take the metadata from the chain and

2862
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:29,520
you take the metadata from the chain and
 

2863
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,230
you take the metadata from the chain and
you rebuild the container from within

2864
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:32,240
you rebuild the container from within
 

2865
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,670
you rebuild the container from within
the desktop

2866
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:33,680
the desktop
 

2867
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,790
the desktop
and

2868
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:34,800
and
 

2869
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,789
and
it it verifies that the hash all the

2870
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:36,799
it it verifies that the hash all the
 

2871
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,549
it it verifies that the hash all the
hashes are the same

2872
00:54:38,549 --> 00:54:38,559
hashes are the same
 

2873
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:39,800
hashes are the same
so

2874
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:39,810
so
 

2875
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:40,950
so

[Music]
 

2877
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,190
[Music]
that's how it works in just very brief

2878
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:43,200
that's how it works in just very brief
 

2879
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,430
that's how it works in just very brief
details i don't want to go deeper there

2880
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:45,440
details i don't want to go deeper there
 

2881
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,270
details i don't want to go deeper there
are some considerations

2882
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:47,280
are some considerations
 

2883
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,589
are some considerations
and the hashes of the container is not

2884
00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:49,599
and the hashes of the container is not
 

2885
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,829
and the hashes of the container is not
that simple as you might think actually

2886
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:51,839
that simple as you might think actually
 

2887
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:55,030
that simple as you might think actually
we like

2888
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:55,040

 

2889
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,190

if you know what docker

2890
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:57,200
if you know what docker
 

2891
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,230
if you know what docker
crash container is

2892
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:00,240
crash container is
 

2893
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,069
crash container is
you may know that they are always

2894
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:02,079
you may know that they are always
 

2895
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,230
you may know that they are always
different

2896
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:04,240
different
 

2897
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,870
different
so we had to actually build the hashes

2898
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:06,880
so we had to actually build the hashes
 

2899
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,190
so we had to actually build the hashes
ourselves and stuff like that was it was

2900
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:09,200
ourselves and stuff like that was it was
 

2901
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,030
ourselves and stuff like that was it was
quite an undertaking

2902
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:11,040
quite an undertaking
 

2903
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,109
quite an undertaking
uh it's not as easy as it sounds but in

2904
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:13,119
uh it's not as easy as it sounds but in
 

2905
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,109
uh it's not as easy as it sounds but in
the end yeah that's what you you you

2906
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:15,119
the end yeah that's what you you you
 

2907
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,870
the end yeah that's what you you you
kind of verify

2908
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:16,880
kind of verify
 

2909
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,710
kind of verify
within the extension that

2910
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:18,720
within the extension that
 

2911
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,390
within the extension that
that the container is the same

2912
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:20,400
that the container is the same
 

2913
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,829
that the container is the same
containers you built and that would

2914
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:21,839
containers you built and that would
 

2915
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,829
containers you built and that would
build from gosh and you also verify it

2916
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:23,839
build from gosh and you also verify it
 

2917
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,069
build from gosh and you also verify it
and try against you know you could take

2918
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:26,079
and try against you know you could take
 

2919
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,470
and try against you know you could take
again all the gauche files are available

2920
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:28,480
again all the gauche files are available
 

2921
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,430
again all the gauche files are available
to you

2922
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:29,440
to you
 

2923
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,150
to you
and you can verify that they are part of

2924
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:32,160
and you can verify that they are part of
 

2925
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,910
and you can verify that they are part of
the blockchain as you know because we

2926
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:33,920
the blockchain as you know because we
 

2927
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,470
the blockchain as you know because we
have the proof in the sdk so you have

2928
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:36,480
have the proof in the sdk so you have
 

2929
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,750
have the proof in the sdk so you have
this proofs

2930
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:37,760
this proofs
 

2931
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,430
this proofs
and now you have the

2932
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:39,440
and now you have the
 

2933
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,230
and now you have the
um

2934
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:40,240
um
 

2935
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,789
um
rebuilding this from the core source and

2936
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:42,799
rebuilding this from the core source and
 

2937
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,470
rebuilding this from the core source and
compared to the hash of the container

2938
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:44,480
compared to the hash of the container
 

2939
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,349
compared to the hash of the container
that you run in

2940
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:47,359
that you run in
 

2941
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:50,870
that you run in
you run the desktop in

2942
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:50,880
you run the desktop in
 

2943
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,910
you run the desktop in
that's

2944
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:51,920
that's
 

2945
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,750
that's
basically okay

2946
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:53,760
basically okay
 

2947
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,670
basically okay
of course we rely on some basic

2948
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:55,680
of course we rely on some basic
 

2949
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,510
of course we rely on some basic
containers so

2950
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:57,520
containers so
 

2951
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,789
containers so
like

2952
00:55:58,789 --> 00:55:58,799
like
 

2953
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,430
like
of course the basic container

2954
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:01,440
of course the basic container
 

2955
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,069
of course the basic container
you can still build it from within then

2956
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:04,079
you can still build it from within then
 

2957
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,630
you can still build it from within then
you trust it and so on and then the

2958
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:06,640
you trust it and so on and then the
 

2959
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,230
you trust it and so on and then the
chain of trust is built between the

2960
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:08,240
chain of trust is built between the
 

2961
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,710
chain of trust is built between the
containers they will it's it's a it's a

2962
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:10,720
containers they will it's it's a it's a
 

2963
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,390
containers they will it's it's a it's a
very interesting topic a very

2964
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:12,400
very interesting topic a very
 

2965
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,069
very interesting topic a very
interesting subject and that's actually

2966
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:14,079
interesting subject and that's actually
 

2967
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,190
interesting subject and that's actually
what your software supply chain is

2968
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:17,200
what your software supply chain is
 

2969
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,789
what your software supply chain is
and we will expand we'll bring more

2970
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:18,799
and we will expand we'll bring more
 

2971
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:19,750
and we will expand we'll bring more
tools

2972
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:19,760
tools
 

2973
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,589
tools
into this part

2974
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:21,599
into this part
 

2975
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,750
into this part
um and for that we work with great

2976
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:23,760
um and for that we work with great
 

2977
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,069
um and for that we work with great
partners uh

2978
00:56:26,069 --> 00:56:26,079
partners uh
 

2979
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,309
partners uh
to do that i but i cannot

2980
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:28,319
to do that i but i cannot
 

2981
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:29,829
to do that i but i cannot
still i cannot

still i cannot
 

2983
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:31,589
still i cannot
talk about them yet

2984
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:31,599
talk about them yet
 

2985
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,589
talk about them yet
okay

2986
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:33,599
okay
 

2987
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,670
okay
how we're going to like tile the knots

2988
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:35,680
how we're going to like tile the knots
 

2989
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,430
how we're going to like tile the knots
there in in in this process of

2990
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:39,440
there in in in this process of
 

2991
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,750
there in in in this process of
you know of this building this chain of

2992
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:41,760
you know of this building this chain of
 

2993
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,750
you know of this building this chain of
trust

2994
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:43,760
trust
 

2995
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,549
trust
picking up these components

2996
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:46,559
picking up these components
 

2997
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:47,990
picking up these components
okay

2998
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:48,000
okay
 

2999
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,910
okay
but as i said before we sorry as i said

3000
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:49,920
but as i said before we sorry as i said
 

3001
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,589
but as i said before we sorry as i said
before we will also

3002
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:51,599
before we will also
 

3003
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,990
before we will also
want to move to ci cd part and we want

3004
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:54,000
want to move to ci cd part and we want
 

3005
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,430
want to move to ci cd part and we want
to

3006
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:55,440
to
 

3007
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,150
to
replace jenkins

3008
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:58,160
replace jenkins
 

3009
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,390
replace jenkins
big portions of jenkins as well because

3010
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:00,400
big portions of jenkins as well because
 

3011
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,190
big portions of jenkins as well because
this is jenkins is a huge security

3012
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:03,200
this is jenkins is a huge security
 

3013
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,230
this is jenkins is a huge security
call

3014
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:04,240
call
 

3015
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,230
call
one big security hole actually

3016
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:08,240

 

3017
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,549

and we want to put this whole process on

3018
00:57:10,549 --> 00:57:10,559
and we want to put this whole process on
 

3019
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,430
and we want to put this whole process on
chain as well and include that

3020
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:13,440
chain as well and include that
 

3021
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,150
chain as well and include that
so

3022
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:14,160
so
 

3023
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,910
so
you not only build containers and you on

3024
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:15,920
you not only build containers and you on
 

3025
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,430
you not only build containers and you on
top of these containers you will hold

3026
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:17,440
top of these containers you will hold
 

3027
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,150
top of these containers you will hold
your continuous delivery process

3028
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:20,160
your continuous delivery process
 

3029
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,030
your continuous delivery process
on top of that containers and this also

3030
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:23,040
on top of that containers and this also
 

3031
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,789
on top of that containers and this also
kind of goes back and forth between the

3032
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:24,799
kind of goes back and forth between the
 

3033
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:28,309
kind of goes back and forth between the
blockchain and the and the uh your test

3034
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:28,319
blockchain and the and the uh your test
 

3035
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,549
blockchain and the and the uh your test
test runs and so on and so forth

3036
00:57:30,549 --> 00:57:30,559
test runs and so on and so forth
 

3037
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:31,510
test runs and so on and so forth
um

3038
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:31,520
um
 

3039
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,390
um
yeah it's a

3040
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:32,400
yeah it's a

00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:37,040
it's interesting
 

3045
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,990
it's interesting
okay

3046
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:38,000
okay
 

3047
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,430

how can i how can i run
like tests in one programming language

3052
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:44,000
like tests in one programming language
 

3053
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,549

this has nothing to do with programming

3060

this has nothing to do with programming

3063
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,230

how you build container today we don't

3064
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:54,240
how you build container today we don't
 

3065
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,270
how you build container today we don't
care about

3066
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:55,280
care about
 

3067
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,950
care about
what what programming language did you

3068
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:56,960
what what programming language did you
 

3069
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,750
what what programming language did you
use right

3070
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:01,760

 

3071
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,829

you're asking about what languages of

3072
00:58:03,829 --> 00:58:03,839
you're asking about what languages of
 

3073
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:07,030
you're asking about what languages of
what of cicd or what languages

3074
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:07,040
what of cicd or what languages
 

3075
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,829
what of cicd or what languages
i i'm just asking uh where where the

3076
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:09,839
i i'm just asking uh where where the
 

3077
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:13,190
i i'm just asking uh where where the
actual cicd process go it will it will

3078
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:13,200
actual cicd process go it will it will
 

3079
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,510
actual cicd process go it will it will
be one chain basically so the scripts

3080
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:15,520
be one chain basically so the scripts
 

3081
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,829
be one chain basically so the scripts
will be the smart contracts

3082
00:58:17,829 --> 00:58:17,839
will be the smart contracts
 

3083
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:19,349
will be the smart contracts
and

3084
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:19,359
and
 

3085
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:20,470
and
the and

3086
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:20,480
the and
 

3087
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,789
the and
the binary

3088
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:22,799
the binary
 

3089
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,829
the binary
and you run it like on off chain

3090
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:25,839
and you run it like on off chain
 

3091
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,630
and you run it like on off chain
locally and execute all your cicd

3092
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:28,640
locally and execute all your cicd
 

3093
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,309
locally and execute all your cicd
process using this

3094
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:30,319
process using this
 

3095
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:32,309
process using this
uh but you can always verify that what

3096
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:32,319
uh but you can always verify that what
 

3097
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,950
uh but you can always verify that what
you run locally is the same as as you

3098
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:34,960
you run locally is the same as as you
 

3099
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,630
you run locally is the same as as you
run it on the blockchain

3100
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:36,640
run it on the blockchain
 

3101
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,710
run it on the blockchain
it's like debug model

3102
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:38,720
it's like debug model
 

3103
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:44,470
it's like debug model
okay ci cd debug

3104
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:44,480

 

3105
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,630

okay

3106
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:46,640
okay
 

3107
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,309
okay
so moving on i think we only have a

3108
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:48,319
so moving on i think we only have a
 

3109
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:50,150
so moving on i think we only have a
couple left i'm not sure if this one's a

3110
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:50,160
couple left i'm not sure if this one's a
 

3111
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,750
couple left i'm not sure if this one's a
joke though because you might have

3112
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:51,760
joke though because you might have
 

3113
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,670
joke though because you might have
answered this a few times already sorry

3114
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:53,680
answered this a few times already sorry
 

3115
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,789
answered this a few times already sorry
about that but it got pointed out again

3116
00:58:56,789 --> 00:58:56,799
about that but it got pointed out again
 

3117
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,230
about that but it got pointed out again
um

3118
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:58,240
um
 

3119
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,990
um
yeah is it possible that gosh will have

3120
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:00,000
yeah is it possible that gosh will have
 

3121
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,230
yeah is it possible that gosh will have
its own defy in economics other than get

3122
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:02,240
its own defy in economics other than get
 

3123
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,390
its own defy in economics other than get
on chain and i ask if it might bypass

3124
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:04,400
on chain and i ask if it might bypass
 

3125
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,510
on chain and i ask if it might bypass
everscale economics in that regard

3126
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:09,520

 

3127
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,030

not sure about what you mean by

3128
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:11,040
not sure about what you mean by
 

3129
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,270
not sure about what you mean by
bypassing

3130
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:13,280
bypassing
 

3131
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,549
bypassing
bypass

3132
00:59:14,549 --> 00:59:14,559
bypass
 

3133
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,069
bypass
bypasses and

3134
00:59:16,069 --> 00:59:16,079
bypasses and
 

3135
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:20,069
bypasses and
take us

3136
00:59:20,069 --> 00:59:20,079

 

3137
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,270

i

3138
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:21,280
i
 

3139
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,630
i
don't know about values it's a

3140
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:22,640
don't know about values it's a
 

3141
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,150
don't know about values it's a
speculation

3142
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:26,160

 

3143
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,190

but

3144
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:27,200
but
 

3145
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,230
but
you can

3146
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:28,240
you can
 

3147
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,309
you can
you know you can benefit from both

3148
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:30,319
you know you can benefit from both
 

3149
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:33,670
you know you can benefit from both
so what do you care who bypasses whom

3150
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:33,680
so what do you care who bypasses whom
 

3151
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,750
so what do you care who bypasses whom
uh it's really not important it's

3152
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:35,760
uh it's really not important it's
 

3153
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,150
uh it's really not important it's
important is that you provide value you

3154
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:38,160
important is that you provide value you
 

3155
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,230
important is that you provide value you
build value and then you benefit from it

3156
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:40,240
build value and then you benefit from it
 

3157
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,910
build value and then you benefit from it
and if you benefit

3158
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:41,920
and if you benefit
 

3159
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,430
and if you benefit
if sitting on everscale would benefit

3160
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:43,440
if sitting on everscale would benefit
 

3161
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:48,069
if sitting on everscale would benefit
from gosh vice versa why not

3162
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:48,079

 

3163
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,349

i mean

3164
00:59:51,349 --> 00:59:51,359

 

3165
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:55,349

it wouldn't have defy applications

3166
00:59:55,349 --> 00:59:55,359

 

3167
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,270

not in the sense

3168
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:57,280
not in the sense
 

3169
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,630
not in the sense
that you might think of meaning that

3170
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:00,640
that you might think of meaning that
 

3171
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,549
that you might think of meaning that
when you say defy

3172
01:00:02,549 --> 01:00:02,559
when you say defy
 

3173
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,710
when you say defy
like gouache is everything

3174
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:04,720
like gouache is everything
 

3175
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,910
like gouache is everything

surrounding git and open source
 

3177
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,470

it will provide ways to monetize your

but it's not the defy that you used to

3184
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:18,000
but it's not the defy that you used to
 

3185
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,430
but it's not the defy that you used to
have

3186
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:19,440
have
 

3187
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,750
have

3188
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:21,760
in every scale for example where you
 

3189
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,390
in every scale for example where you
know you have pairs trading and provide

01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:24,400
know you have pairs trading and provide

3193
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,670

that you have basically it's a

3196
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:29,920
speculative activities gosh is not about
 

3197
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,390
speculative activities gosh is not about
speculative activities mostly it's about

3198
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:32,400
speculative activities mostly it's about
 

3199
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,270
speculative activities mostly it's about
real value and real applications

3200
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:35,280
real value and real applications
 

3201
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,589
real value and real applications
so in that respect it's

3202
01:00:37,589 --> 01:00:37,599
so in that respect it's
 

3203
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,230
so in that respect it's
well i don't know what you consider defy

3204
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:40,240
well i don't know what you consider defy
 

3205
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,470
well i don't know what you consider defy
and because the i today it seems it's

3206
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:42,480
and because the i today it seems it's
 

3207
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,160
and because the i today it seems it's
just inflation

3208
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:44,170
just inflation

it only works because

then then you can say that you have
 

3265
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,870
then then you can say that you have
decentralized the financial tools

3365
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,270
solved
and i think the only way to solve it is

3366
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:39,280
and i think the only way to solve it is
 

3367
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,270

01:04:20,789 --> 01:04:20,799
by certain threshold this block will be
 

3397
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:21,910
by certain threshold this block will be
stored

3398
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:21,920
stored
 

3399
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,069
stored
the blob will contain the hash and the

3400
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:24,079
the blob will contain the hash and the
 

3401
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:26,390
the blob will contain the hash and the
address and the ipfs and they and then

3402
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:26,400
address and the ipfs and they and then
 

3403
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,910
address and the ipfs and they and then
uh object itself will be stored on ibiza

3404
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:29,920
uh object itself will be stored on ibiza
 

3405
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,670
uh object itself will be stored on ibiza
you mentioned this and it's it works

3406
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:31,680
you mentioned this and it's it works
 

3407
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,390
you mentioned this and it's it works
right

3408
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:32,400
right
 

3409
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,990
right
yeah

3410
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:34,000
yeah
 

3411
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:34,950
yeah
um

3412
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:34,960
um
 

3413
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,710
um
the web interface is not part of the

3414
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:36,720
the web interface is not part of the
 

3415
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,870
the web interface is not part of the
public component what is the reason for

3416
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:38,880
public component what is the reason for
 

3417
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,710
public component what is the reason for
this it will be no reason

3418
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:40,720
this it will be no reason
 

3419
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,029
this it will be no reason
okay you will be

3420
01:04:43,029 --> 01:04:43,039
okay you will be
 

3421
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:45,109
okay you will be
um

3422
01:04:45,109 --> 01:04:45,119
um
 

3423
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:47,829
um
will the gosh interface be adapted to

3424
01:04:47,829 --> 01:04:47,839
will the gosh interface be adapted to
 

3425
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:50,710
will the gosh interface be adapted to
uh use the usual non-crypto communities

3426
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:50,720
uh use the usual non-crypto communities
 

3427
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,870
uh use the usual non-crypto communities
to be intuitive for use by the average

3428
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:52,880
to be intuitive for use by the average
 

3429
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,789
to be intuitive for use by the average
person it is

3430
01:04:54,789 --> 01:04:54,799
person it is
 

3431
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:57,750
person it is
it is exactly like github today yeah

3432
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:57,760
it is exactly like github today yeah
 

3433
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,950
it is exactly like github today yeah
so

3434
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:58,960
so
 

3435
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,470
so
the only reason the only difference

3436
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:00,480
the only reason the only difference
 

3437
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,829
the only reason the only difference
right now there are two difference right

3438
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:01,839
right now there are two difference right
 

3439
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:04,069
right now there are two difference right
now one you need to

3440
01:05:04,069 --> 01:05:04,079
now one you need to
 

3441
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:04,870
now one you need to
just

3442
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:04,880
just
 

3443
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,109
just
just remember the 12 words

3444
01:05:07,109 --> 01:05:07,119
just remember the 12 words
 

3445
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:10,549
just remember the 12 words
so that's kind of a thing but we will

3446
01:05:10,549 --> 01:05:10,559
so that's kind of a thing but we will
 

3447
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:12,950
so that's kind of a thing but we will
get away from that

3448
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:12,960
get away from that
 

3449
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:13,990
get away from that
we have a

3450
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:14,000
we have a
 

3451
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,470
we have a
interesting ways to get away from that

3452
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:16,480
interesting ways to get away from that
 

3453
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,589
interesting ways to get away from that
um

3454
01:05:17,589 --> 01:05:17,599
um
 

3455
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:19,349
um
but in the end you you will have like

3456
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:19,359
but in the end you you will have like
 

3457
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,349
but in the end you you will have like
for example use some some

3458
01:05:21,349 --> 01:05:21,359
for example use some some
 

3459
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:23,829
for example use some some
other application to store this still

3460
01:05:23,829 --> 01:05:23,839
other application to store this still
 

3461
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:25,990
other application to store this still
like so that's doesn't go away because

3462
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:26,000
like so that's doesn't go away because
 

3463
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,309
like so that's doesn't go away because
the decentralization comes with you

3464
01:05:28,309 --> 01:05:28,319
the decentralization comes with you
 

3465
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:31,190
the decentralization comes with you
remembering 12 or 24 words

3466
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:31,200
remembering 12 or 24 words
 

3467
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,390
remembering 12 or 24 words
um

3468
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:32,400
um
 

3469
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,630
um
that's one thing the second thing is dao

3470
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:34,640
that's one thing the second thing is dao
 

3471
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,789
that's one thing the second thing is dao
dao is what different from but there's a

3472
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:36,799
dao is what different from but there's a
 

3473
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,549
dao is what different from but there's a
whole point right so you the

3474
01:05:38,549 --> 01:05:38,559
whole point right so you the
 

3475
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,109
whole point right so you the

repository in a dual way and
 

3485
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,789
repository in a dual way and
it's only start right now they basically

01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,750
just distribute
it launch the dow

3490
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:55,760
it launch the dow
 

3491
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,750
it launch the dow
you deploy the dow distribute 100 tokens

3492
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:57,760
you deploy the dow distribute 100 tokens
 

3493
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,150
you deploy the dow distribute 100 tokens
to each participant

01:06:59,029 --> 01:06:59,039
there are some interesting questions
 

3553
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:01,270
there are some interesting questions
actually very interesting questions not

actually very interesting questions not
 

3555
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,789
actually very interesting questions not
going to go there but there are very

3556

3757
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:55,030
but the join mailing list you will get
into particularly the beta program okay

01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:01,120
the tonics project solves part of the
 

3765
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,270
the tonics project solves part of the
needs of the gosh architecture so is it

3766
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:03,280
needs of the gosh architecture so is it
 

3767
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,430
needs of the gosh architecture so is it
not clear why the tonic's components are

3768
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:05,440
not clear why the tonic's components are
 

3769
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,310
not clear why the tonic's components are
not used in the development of gosh

3770
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:08,320
not used in the development of gosh
 

3771

and uh if it would use linux components
 

3795
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:37,110
and uh if it would use linux components
it will be it would be even slower

3796
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:37,120

it's not a use case okay and this use

will be used

3806
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:47,360
will be used
 

3807
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,750
will be used
but not on the basic level basic level

3808
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:49,760
but not on the basic level basic level
 

3809
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,070
but not on the basic level basic level
you just want you know push

3810
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:52,080
you just want you know push
 

3811
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,470
you just want you know push
and you want this push to be fast

3812
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:54,480
and you want this push to be fast
 

3813
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,990
and you want this push to be fast
really fast

3814
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:56,000
really fast
 

3815
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,229
really fast
and in order to do that you need to

3816
01:11:58,229 --> 01:11:58,239
and in order to do that you need to
 

3817
01:11:58,239 --> 01:11:59,669
and in order to do that you need to
really optimize the architect by the way

3818
01:11:59,669 --> 01:11:59,679
really optimize the architect by the way
 

3819
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:01,750
really optimize the architect by the way
it's not optimized as i said

3820
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:01,760
it's not optimized as i said
 

3821
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,430
it's not optimized as i said
really optimize architecture to allow

3822
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:05,440
really optimize architecture to allow
 

3823
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,229
really optimize architecture to allow
this

3824
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:06,239
this
 

3825
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,510
this
to work really just you know

3826
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:09,520
to work really just you know
 

3827
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,149
to work really just you know
okay flex is a great example if you if

3828
01:12:12,149 --> 01:12:12,159
okay flex is a great example if you if
 

3829
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:14,790
okay flex is a great example if you if
you use flex if you ever used flex

3830
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:14,800
you use flex if you ever used flex
 

3831
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,950
you use flex if you ever used flex
by the way drawing the beta program and

3832
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:16,960
by the way drawing the beta program and
 

3833
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,470
by the way drawing the beta program and
you will

3834
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:18,480
you will
 

3835
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,950
you will
you can see how fast it is

3836
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:20,960
you can see how fast it is
 

3837
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,149
you can see how fast it is
and um if we would just

3838
01:12:24,149 --> 01:12:24,159
and um if we would just
 

3839
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:25,990
and um if we would just
use the

3840
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:26,000
use the
 

3841
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,510
use the
kind of

3842
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:27,520
kind of
 

3843
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,669
kind of
just make a architecture that would be

3844
01:12:29,669 --> 01:12:29,679
just make a architecture that would be
 

3845
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,990
just make a architecture that would be
you know

3846
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:32,000
you know
 

3847
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,270
you know
kind of put the

3848
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:35,280

 

3849
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,030

you know how how

3850
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:37,040
you know how how

corporate architects software architects
usually do that right put a lot of this

3854
01:12:41,669 --> 01:12:41,679
usually do that right put a lot of this
 

3855
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,709
usually do that right put a lot of this
boxes on the board and okay this will go

3856
01:12:44,709 --> 01:12:44,719
boxes on the board and okay this will go
 

3857
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:46,229
boxes on the board and okay this will go
there and this will go there if we do

3858
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:46,239
there and this will go there if we do
 

3859
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:47,350
there and this will go there if we do
that

3860
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:47,360
that
 

3861
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,709
that
i mean flex would be very slow like we

3862
01:12:50,709 --> 01:12:50,719
i mean flex would be very slow like we
 

3863
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:52,550
i mean flex would be very slow like we
have a lot of slow applications on every

3864
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:52,560
have a lot of slow applications on every
 

3865
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,630
have a lot of slow applications on every
scale right now because simply because

3866
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:54,640
scale right now because simply because
 

3867
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,390
scale right now because simply because
people don't think how to reduce the

3868
01:12:58,390 --> 01:12:58,400
people don't think how to reduce the
 

3869
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,390
people don't think how to reduce the
you know the messaging load and stuff

3870
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:00,400
you know the messaging load and stuff
 

3871
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,510
you know the messaging load and stuff
like that

3872
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:01,520
like that
 

3873
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,470
like that
and we think about every message

3874
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:04,480
and we think about every message
 

3875
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,350
and we think about every message
like

3876
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:05,360
like
 

3877
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,709
like
every single message the whole

3878
01:13:06,709 --> 01:13:06,719
every single message the whole
 

3879
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:09,510
every single message the whole
architecture just just and we actually

3880
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:09,520
architecture just just and we actually
 

3881
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,990
architecture just just and we actually
right now it's not so but

3882
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:12,000
right now it's not so but
 

3883
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,270
right now it's not so but
we already know how to optimize it to

3884
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:15,280
we already know how to optimize it to
 

3885
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,830
we already know how to optimize it to
even like more parallelization

3886
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:17,840
even like more parallelization
 

3887
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,390
even like more parallelization
less messages and so on so

3888
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:20,400
less messages and so on so
 

3889
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,550
less messages and so on so
every contract has every message there

3890
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:22,560
every contract has every message there
 

3891
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,790
every contract has every message there
is counted so it's not just do they take

3892
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:24,800
is counted so it's not just do they take
 

3893
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,630
is counted so it's not just do they take
components from there it works you know

3894
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:26,640
components from there it works you know
 

3895
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,390
components from there it works you know
subsystem boom boom

3896
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:28,400
subsystem boom boom
 

3897
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,470
subsystem boom boom
it doesn't work like that

3898
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:30,480
it doesn't work like that
 

3899
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:33,350
it doesn't work like that
