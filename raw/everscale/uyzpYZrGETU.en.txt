he's on another goal
no it's getting all set up now
i've just got the notification mind we
are we are live huh cool we're good
i think everybody's here too great and
so many people have cameras on too
danila come back you've got a great
setup
yeah sorry
great
okay good day everybody welcome to
weekly meet number 102. we have a very
full agenda today with some really good
presentations from the community
and before we jump in i want to remind
you all that the everscale two-year
party is this saturday may 7th don't
miss it we have two great celebrations
so if you want to get on a plane and go
to bali and party then you know do it go
to everpoint dot io get your tickets and
fly over or you could just join the
metaverse party which is
you know you could
sit in your pjs and party
but if you want more information
yes well it's true
anyway if you want um more information
on that just
drop a message in the chat and you know
everybody will provide some information
so um let's just jump over to the tech
updates meecha
all yours hello
yeah i have a couple of
dates
so first of all um
this is the
the current network
version
setup so you can see that we have about
27 currently 25 percent version 24 block
version 24. this is a very very
important update
and this is slowly being rolled rolled
out
now
very slowly because
the node stops for about
an hour sometimes
when updated
and so we cannot just release the date
we couldn't just release that date
and everyone would jump on that the
network would stall so we had to go one
by one and we're still doing this as you
can see so there's about like again
25 network has been updated we will
continue
uh doing this and hope by next uh next
call
network will switch to this new
new new kind of well new update version
which uh then enable compression
and so many other wonderful
uh upgrades to the protocols and other
stuff
um
so
yeah
so this is first thing
first of all so again to validators
don't rush don't need to rush
you can
go to sergey turin
and ask him
for information and he will
give you
this information where to go what update
that he has all the instructions
and alternatively he can you can install
his scripts
and his scripts
uh will update your note automatically
and will do it intelligently also so
the script will
choose the time for your note to be
upgraded
safely
so
you can go lazy way
with
certainly great scripts or you can go
active way and just thinking
i know he hates me by now but it's okay
anyway
so this is one thing
another thing
is
we'll make the announcement today
and you all are welcome
to the 10th of may
gosh launch
which will happen during

the like if it will be before or after
yeah
good luck
speaking of developers uh we have ivan
here who wants to jump in with a psa for
the community to create some tasks for
developers
uh yeah
that's it can you see my screen
yep all good
all right
so
uh so on the screen you see
uh
the bitcoin platform
so we have uh
uh recently launched a
pro account
with bitcoin
and it allows us to
among other things it allows us to
create bounties
so
we tested a few bounces already
uh one bounty
for for 300 usd approval
so
so what it allows us to do uh is to
connect github issues
to this platform and this platform
doesn't create the payment for those who
who accomplish some tasks
so various tasks that would be minor
tasks major tasks projects researches or
just community engagement anything
so uh
and uh the the bitcoin platform has a
huge developer community throughout all
the world so this is a major hackathon
platform actually
and um
despite having some pro accounts and the
availability of this like functionality
we also will
i just want to announce that we will
have a special
like unique special event hosted on
bitcoin so that will that will be online
hackathon called
ever scale
error scale escalator
so
and we
are preparing of course some workshops
demos
and
[Music]
some like challenging projects
with all of the
ecosystem
ecosystem partners who will be making
financially this hackathon broke system
it vault maybe everex
by the way if you want to join please
take a look
so uh what what i want to ask the
community for uh is to
please ping me
uh
here's the qr code was my contact
uh
think me if if your company or your team
wants to develop something and you want
a front-end for back-end or
uh smart contact stuff or some
architectural design or you want to just
engage with developer community
so tell me about your project don't know
what what tasks you have
we can break them down and uh
um like engage the worldwide developer
community to contribute to the open
source because bitcoin is a major
platform for funding open source
contributions
uh and uh
like the bounties is a separate check
uh
and the the hackathon is a separate
track so
for the hackathon we need like some some
challenging and cool tasks as well so i
have some something in mind
uh related to bridge related to some
defy related to creating some
social like analog of social
applications like twitter
uh on chain etc etc by the way inspired
by
gosh stuff
like it's it's all possible on every
scale so and we and we want to show to
the world that that our platform is is
basically a
like decentralized back end so
so if you have some like ideas or dreams
what you want to build on every scale
this is like this is a point this is a
possibility to bring it to life
so
uh so yeah just think me by this qr code
with any ideas how you want to be like
present on this platform with bounties
either either bounties or or on the
hackathon itself if you want to be
presented one hackathon of course you
like need to back your uh your
challenges with some funds but we'll
like speak to about that personally like
we can support you from
from process fund or defile fund
whatever
so so yeah depends on on what you have
in mind
so yeah so for example like there will
be a presentation of uh like dao creator
uh from eugene and uh this this is
perfectly fits for for for such thing
so uh like i personally want to
to see like
dao creation dogs
in in the like
for a hackathon check
so yeah so that that's basically it
so please thank me if you have something
in mind and we will like bring it to
life thank you
cool great thank you for sharing i know
that you've been driving this
partnership with bitcoin for a long time
so i'm happy to see it
see it working out
do you think that they'll ever
um
let us
give rewards or bounties than ever
uh well
yeah
they actually integrated uh a coin on on
other networks so
ever on bnb and on ethereum so it will
be available uh for native integration
they need some more time because they
are fully packed up with resources
like development tasks but we can create
a bounty actually to integrate that to
their back end because they are open
source so
yeah i want to create such paths but
well will the people request accept it
or not it totally depends on on bitcoin
team uh so so yeah but but we will like
push for that if if someone wants to
contribute please please write me
cool
okay thank you for sharing i hope that
works out
let's give away all the evidence yeah
that was like a pretty like expensive
stuff so yeah i hope so
yeah but we hope it will work out so
like yeah prepare for like for working
with developer community because we need
to like to resist the the inflow of
developers and we want them to to not
like turn their backs on us that that's
important definitely yeah prepare
discords prepare telegrams prepare
everything
do you want to drop the the link to the
git coin page uh actually it's uh it's
um it's a
git coin dot
co everscale minus work i will i will
just drop it in zoom chat and then just
please share it yeah i'll put it on
youtube
cool that's it okay i need to run yeah
thank you okay
five and
get out you need to
so next up on the agenda is the aml safe
the anti-money laundering safe which is
really cool uh the team i think they are
the ninth grant winner from the defy
alliance and this team decided to add
everscale and ever to the pull-up
supported blockchains that they have
and we have danila here
uh to tell us more about the project hi
daniela and welcome to our weekly call
hi guys thanks for having me
so can i share the screen
yes do you have rights uh can you
okay it's working
it's working okay
um
okay so
so do you see it yeah
okay yeah um
okay guys um thank hi again
so let me introduce uh to community
mlsafe so the first crypto world with
embedded ammo model
so what is actually is so we are
building the web 3.0 decentralized
wallet with the features that you expect
to see in
uh decentralized wallet like exchange
sending money buy and sell crypto with
the credit card but what you are not
expecting to see is the am our aml
feature
and for those of you who don't know what
is ml it's actually
for anti-money laundry and you might be
asking
why is even in crypto world because the
crypto is transparent it's secured and
anonymous
yeah that's all true about crypto but
let me show you like one example
so imagine we have employer and
freelancer and they actually decided to
get paid in crypto
and the regular the common way uh how
they do that is
uh employer from the wallet one sending
crypto to freelancer to
world of the two
and
after the freelancer receiving the money
they do virtually handshake and say
goodbye to each other
and after that all of the freelancers
look like this
so they're actually really excited
because they get paid and
the cryptos on the balance and they
think there is nothing to worry about so
everything is okay
but what if i told you that this crypto
uh was not the crypto that you are
regular thinking of
what if i told you that this crypto was
spoiled
and if we close look to the scripter
that might be like this
uh it could be the crypto from the
stolen wallets it could be the tokens
used uh in dark markets in its uh like
etc etc it could be scam tokens and so
on
and after the receiving descriptor to
your wallet you right now are sharing
the reputation of that crypto and your
entire wallet uh just get spoiled
and
um okay so what
uh how does the affect your real life
and what's
how does that affect you especially
um but we are not stopping there um
we're going
further
and for example if you want to
[Music]
like window this money what you what
like freelancers usually do they go to
oh sorry they go to
like crypt exchange for example finance
hobby
might be dead centralized exchange like
one inch and actually like send the
money to these exchanges and after
sending this money they actually could
receive the message uh with the copy uh
sorry due to our email policy blah blah
blah
your account was banned and we are
suspect that you are related to this
kind of illegal activities
and you could see this kind of picture
so
you just receive 100 uct and your entire
balance on all of your platforms could
be banned uh due to ammo policy
why this happened uh because actually we
know about this crypto that this crypto
came from the dark sources and these uh
crypt exchanges use the same algorithms
that we do to
know uh exactly where is this crypto
come from and to mark the script as
the legal services
and after this picture many freelancers
look like this
because they really like
they
scare it because they're all money has
gone
and they don't even know if it's
possible to
unbound the accounts and block their
money so this is really really scary
situation and actually it's happened
every single day we have a lot of
customers that come to us with the same
problem
so um what we suggest and what we are
approaching here so how the future how
we see the future um dealing with uh
crypto
will go to
so for example
um so for example we suggest uh
before you receiving any amount of money
you just ask kindly to other side could
you please provide me the
wallet address from which you are going
to send me money and you could check
this address for example
he give you the employer give you the
wallet you just check it and you'll see
this picture
and that's mean that it's so dangerous
to make any kind of partnership or
dealing with this address and you are
it's it's safe to
not dealing with this partner what you
can do here you could ask do you have
another wallet uh
from which you could send me money and
he could give you another wallet and you
could check it and if you see this
picture so we absolutely save to go and
there is no way you get banned in the
future
um so the funny fact is that employer
could
could they they actually don't know
about the
situation of their bullets so that's
it's um it's not reason to blame them
because they don't know to
where this money comes from and it
doesn't mean that employer wanted to
like trick you and want to send you
stolen money they don't know if even
so
um and
this is like we come why are we doing
this why we're doing this product
because we want to help people we want
to help people to save the money we
wanted to
uh help people to be aware of the
dark part of the internet their script
comes from
sometimes and yeah to be
[Music]
and to prevent being blocked on the
crypto exchange platforms
and what we can tell about the crypto
wallets actually uh literally everything
so we have 25 sources that we analyze uh
we group them in uh in three groups it's
dangerous sources suspicious sources and
trusted services and we analyze it all
of that and we will give you your risk
score or the risks or of your partner so
um if you're on on a red zone it's mean
that you have a high chance of being
blocked and the crypt exchange plus or
even in debt centralized crypto
exchanges like uni swap or one inch
because they use the same algorithm as
we do and they actually uh
they actually too care about the ml
policy
yeah so if you're in a green zone you're
safe to go it's like nothing worried
about and we provided the detailed
analytics there you can see um of like
the exact amount of um
of money that received from this wallet
from different sources and what's
interesting here is that the small
amount of dangerous sources are really
impact a lot to your wallet so for
example if you have five percent of dark
market
um
funds it's it's make uh a big chance of
being blocked because it's a lot it's
like less than one percent is okay but
it's it's very dangerous too
um
so we supported uh most popular
blockchains bitcoin ethereum and all of
the erc20 tokens the non-smart channel
tools the tokens based on the
uh bc uh tron and all of the tokens
based on the
on the tron blockchain and coming soon
everscale
um
really really coming soon yeah we're
hoping to and later this year the
polygon and solana come in two as well
you might be asking is it free so do you
have to pay something for that actually
the first three ml checks
in our application is free for all users
so you could check your wallet you could
check the walls of your
partners contractors yeah whatever and
actually you will be surprised
i can tell you you will be so surprised
about the reputation of your wallet and
the reputation of quality that you're
dealing with so yeah it's definitely fun
to
check it for yourself
um and
if you need more it starts like as less
as
0.3 dollars per one check
um and if you don't need any of ml
functions you could still use animal
safe like a regular crypto wallet with
air scale support so it's absolutely
free to use like a normal wallet
um so yeah that's all um
it's like i just like simplified all of
the picture here because you know it's
like a little little bit complicated if
you go into ml policy but i just wanted
to make it simple to give you an idea of
how it's work
and if you have any question i would
like to answer it
wow that was a fascinating presentation
this is an excellent uh project imagine
imagine having your salary paid in
crypto and then one day the feds show up
at your door and think you're like a
human trafficker and sees all your money
and everything that's a horror story
but but what you've made is is really
useful and it's definitely worth the
peace of mind like you just can't pass
up
what 30 cents
to keep your salary
that's amazing yeah it's
it's like if you pay 30 cents it's like
you know like a backups yeah you pay 30
cents to make sure that everything is
okay yeah it's like is it worth it to
like save your like all the savings that
you have on your wallet i think so
yeah 100
we have a question from ben
half question half compliment i just
want to
say that is one of the cleanest uh
most uh enthralling presentations we've
ever had on these weekly meetups i think
so uh just a round of applause to uh
yourself and whoever put that slideshow
together that's that's brilliant work
um yeah um half the question is
basically uh revolving around and i know
it sounds obvious and you probably said
it but just to kind of uh feed you the
line um is it ready can can a a
simpleton like me go off and go check my
wallets now
yeah definitely actually actually you
could actually we have like
you could create your uh new wallet or
you could import the wallet like from
the seed phrase or whatever you want
and yeah you could you could you could
see and uh the um the cool feature is
you uh checked your ethereum address
that means that uh that would be the one
i'd be worried about to be honest yeah
all of your
all of your rc20 tokens will be in this
statistic as well so we will show you
your entire portfolio uh the risk score
of your entire wallet
well given the amount of um dodgy erc20
tokens that have been dropped into our
wallet over the years and i i hope you
have a good capacity for
these systems i may be testing your
service but yeah fantastic work guys
honestly i'm blown over by that great
work thank you so much thank you so much
guys are there any other questions i
don't see hands up
um can you please stop sharing your
screen and
let people know if they have any
questions how to how to ping you um
maybe if there's a team chat on telegram
i know that your website is amlsafe.io
people can go there
so if there's anything else just
let us
know okay
okay so moving on next on the agenda the
everscale japan chapter recently
organized and co-sponsored a hackathon
for japanese developers
so they're on boarding more talent to
the everscale ecosystem and we have
dunya here to tell us more about the
hackathon so welcome dunya
yeah uh thank you for inviting me so
hello uh this is junior from japan sg so
i want to give you a brief report on the
event held by japan sg so first of all
i'm not very good at in at english
conversations so if you have any
comments or questions please send me a
text
while talking
so
[Music]
we co-hosted an event called the
japanese year horizon from april uh
16th to
24th
with the jpyc company
jpyc is also the japanese yen's stable
coin
this was a second for time for us
ten teams of 19 talented devs
participated in this hacksan
who competed to implement products using
jpyc
for us
the goal of the jpyc hacksaw was to
expand evasco's recognition among
engineers in japan
so currently a jpyc is distributed on
major blockchains israel polygon average
and other even compatible change
jpyc is not yet available on everscale
so realistically from a liquidity
perspective it is currently very
difficult to distribute jpyc on ever
scale
so however the first step for any
technology is to get engineers
interested in ever scale
so therefore
we concentrated on making engineers
interested in evasco's technology
through the event
on the first day of the event
ever-skilled japan's representative
ayama introduced eva scale
fortunately some of their participants
were interested in everscale
however
they were disappointed when i told them
they
that they cannot implement
evm
so of course i told them that the ebm
workchain will be raised
then
they said they would like to try
everscribe if avm is implemented on a
pascal
so the hacksaw made it clear
that engineers still have a strong
desire for evm so we hope to see the evm
blockchain out as soon as possible
so we will continue to increase evasco's
exposure through
hacksaws and blockchain events
so this was a brief update regarding the
hacksaw from japan sg so if you have any
comments or questions please send me a
text during the meet up i will respond
as much as possible thank you
okay great thank you yeah um
while having this hackathon did anybody
come back to you with any concerns or
feedback such as
not enough resources or content in the
japanese language for japanese
developers
uh excuse me i didn't catch it so
please text
for sticks and
so okay i can write it to you
oh yeah i'll write it to you no problem
yeah
okay thank you very much
uh does anybody have any other questions
virginia
i think that's probably best is if we
put the questions into text and uh
junior can obviously uh read and
translate them across and we'll come
back to that at the end maybe that's
easier for you buddy
yep sounds good
okay then we'll move on to the next
topic on our agenda and this one's a
very important one um
and it's also a very important project
which is going on in the background so
very few know about it because the team
is very focused
and working very quickly and efficiently
it was built as a response
on the
attack on ukraine
and the country became understandably
concerned about its art its culture
and history and needed a way to safely
preserve it
so to loop everybody in
our wonderful ben interviewed eugene who
is
just neck deep in the museum heritage
project
and he's going to share it with us now
yeah
yeah thank you for teeing me up i'm just
going to uh quickly blitter while i make
sure i can work the map this week
you don't want to share the video player
but yes uh just to frame it a little bit
obviously um did this uh this topic does
relate to geopolitical issues indirectly
uh but obviously uh this isn't about
politics this isn't about you know that
kind of thing this is about people and
it's about everscale basically and
what's being built in the ecosystem uh
so obviously you know
if anyone does have any strong opinions
and
i mean i don't really feel like i should
have to say this but just in case you
know please let's obviously keep on
topic here and uh try and understand the
nuances of the situation and on that
note let's uh just check there we go
how's that looking joe
looks good it looks good and if you just
want to give me a quick uh bibbidi bob
if you can hear it when it starts going
hello
i've just introduced myself here i
imagine on the weekly meet-up but it's
it's kind of late here in the uk closer
to midnight than not and uh
myself ends up you know in by now i'm
the man the myth the legend uh mr eugene
morozov and i've got something very very
cool and exciting and heartwarming to
tell you about
um yeah i'm not going to say too much
about it because i'm a bit of a
blithering idiot by this time i guess
this time of night uh but eugene you can
always talk can you
it froze
first come about and could you maybe
we froze have we or uh it stopped then
it began again
okey doke i think it might have been uh
i
did something on my end so right
you kind of tie in who uh
the maria is who the main people are you
know what what is what is it we want to
tell people about you
of course ben
thanks for asking those questions
this initiative which we call museums
heritage
started when a member of uh governmental
chain association
uh by the name maria escuela
who is
through her work
through her colleagues a member of the
international museums coalition
and they essentially were asking a
question
how can a blockchain community
help
museums
and galleries that
are at risk of being uh damaged or
heard in any possible way or maybe you
know polluted as a result of
uh
a war
going on
obviously no secret there is uh
there's a big one going on in the world
right now which is you know obviously uh
very close to a lot of people's hearts
and we're we're not here to be political
though uh but so yeah i mean but please
do continue
yes and so we thought about how do we
can respond and uh
actually a number of people came up with
um an idea that
we can help uh by
creating an immutable record of museums
collection
that will be stored forever um on
blockchain as evidence as a catalog of
what the collection
was a particular time
that
also obviously opens a possibility for
now museums to
monetize um
some of the collections that they have
and receive so much needed
cash
of course i mean i know here in the uk
especially since covid and a lot of you
know other kind of events
uh galleries and public you know
exhibition centers gig houses all the
all these types of businesses are really
you know they're struggling they are in
a tough place places which have been
open 50 100 years
you know
obviously for any cultural institution
or museum in the world perhaps
except maybe the wealthiest privately
supported collections
um and
i believe it was um
obvious that um we should come up with
something
that will help those museums preserve
and then in the future
monetize their holdings
and this
initiative was supported by
a number of people in the labor scale
community
and
essentially a very short period of time
in about
three weeks
we had an mvp
which essentially allowed
allows any physio to call in volunteers
follow special instructions to
produce 2d and 3d images
of uh paintings and
sculptures
of course so i mean um just so you kind
of like
you know i say
this is something that
yeah we're not talking about a pipeline
project we're not talking about
something which is coming soon we're
literally talking about something which
is
you know where it's being put into
action now the the people are out there
having the conversations you know
hopefully yeah i mean i'll let you carry
on again so i'm a bugger for doing that
and i i'm always over talking to you
eugene but
yeah i mean this is something which is
genuinely it's not for profit directly
in that kind of way but this is the
technology that everscale is all about
literally out there in the real world
not only solving a problem but you know
yes essentially yeah finding creative
solutions to problems which
down the road as well
yes and it also showcased what the
community can do because in a very short
period of time the the usable
tool
solution has been put in place
and people from many different countries
participated in that
yeah i mean obviously we are quite short
on time here so one of the main things i
wanted to get across is obviously
as you mentioned earlier there's a lady
with the government blockchain
association um and maria and when trump
pronounced her second name uh but yes
yeah i mean she is literally very very
directly affected by world events at the
minute so this is
such a project of passion and
unfortunately you know i was hoping to
be able to have this conversation with
her this evening um but yeah maria
obviously i look forward to speaking to
you soon and and forgive me for my
poetic soul
a nation's identity is principally
defined by its people however it is the
poetry and art and music to which they
revel and the buildings and churches and
monuments in which they laugh and cry
and sing which helps them to define who
and what their identity
identity represents
by embarking upon this project to
preserve as much of ukraine's history as
possible but again also this is a
project that's applicable to anything
we ensure the next generation and those
after them and those after them can not
only remember but find the beauty in the
works of their brothers their sisters
their fathers their grandfathers
forever on ever to add a corny line to
the end but yeah i mean oh i was pretty
damn proud of that and that's how much
this means three folks so
um yeah any final words
thank you very much bird well in which
case i'll take that as high praise and
yes um i think back to me
well
there we go i'm sure you can all see i'm
blushing maybe a little bit uh obviously
i'm a bit of a sensitive emotional soul
so uh yeah like i say um you can see
this is a big very cool thing on some
levels and very important and
and there are lots of people on the
school working behind it um
i think maybe it's best not to take too
many questions on the topic otherwise i
might start getting all the
and show my emotional side too much
around here but uh yeah and thank you
very much
that's great museums heritage that's
that's a really wonderful project if if
anybody wants to find out more about
what's going on or if they want to
contribute their time or skills how can
how can they do this
i would say uh the mr legend uh mr
morozov is the uh the best gentleman to
get in touch with to find out who's
doing what with what oh and here comes
his cheeky little face hey cool hello
sir
well hello and greetings from western
hemisphere everyone yes we have a chat
uh in telegram called museums heritage
or you can write directly to me
we are actually in need of some experts
in 3d photography
we also in need of volunteers um around
museums that are able to come in and do
the uh taking pictures process
uh we certainly could use uh dam
specialist digital asset management
where all the data is being stored until
we move it to blockchain and of course
we need the blockchain people to move
the damn module uh to blockchain
eventually for
immutable storage so reach out to me
thank you
great thank you eugene thank you ben
great presentation and funny video too
i like the overlays
so uh moving on we have
roman here uh roman and evgeny who i'm
not sure if you've seen him on the call
before a bit of a new face here but he's
been a member of the community for a
long time he's also
an i.t entrepreneur they will be sharing
a few concepts regarding dow designs
templates for automated smart contracts
and a proposal for the architecture
of the dao
constructor
so a gentleman the floor is yours
okay hello everyone my name is eugene
i am a tea entrepreneur in from
traditional sphere food touch and
building touch
and i am the member of everscale
community
and my english is not very well
that's why sometimes i will
ask roma to help me
ira man and few guys from community got
together and we have prepared free
proposal of our
proposals for the
debate for criticism and your
suggestions
now the first proposal is principles of
the dao's pending treasuries
second is template of the dao smart
contract and the last one is dao
construction architecture
and we invite each other of you and the
whole community to help us
uh okay uh
roma
next slide list
firstly
we uh all you know what in the
white paper
we
can
read about st token but now
if we want to
vote in the tower
we must
to
to withdraw our tokens and to go to that
that's
not very
useful
and
we want uh
to remind you about
the esta token and
to speed up
to speed up it
next the creation of the smart contract
template
this is
this is a template for creating proposal
and
contracts which are made by proposal
creators to the community
and contract
for automating a proposal to smart
contract
and the last
it's about
how to spending
treasuries some principles how to do it
next slide from please
uh
there
that's three proposals and
we want to create
a cpm uh we have a reputation system uh
it's uh
we called its estimated reputation
system
this is an address reputation explorer
and
we
proposed to develop a dao constructor to
manage
how to spend treasuries
of the everscale community
[Music]
we
try to describe and create
at a plate for adult smart contract and
here is you
see
all
point what
need to
create a contract
to optimizate it in the smart contract
next
please
the
dao constructor
have
four type of the
wallets first it is uh the violet or the
treasuries
we know all its type of
of address
uh
the second type is multi-sync
of the proposals which
is controlled by their community
next type of their wallets is multithink
of proposals which controlled by
proposals team
and the last one
the
the private well it's all the practicums
with our
uh that our
proposals now it's need to the second
violet need to
community again to control spending
their points
for example
the
community vote to some proposal
and
that
get opportunity to
to transfer money from the treasuries uh
to the wallet of proposals
on that violet we can
collect a
different different events what we
see then we implemented
some
idea
[Music]
roma can you help me the next
part i see it's presentation only
today and see only one half
of this presentation
uh yeah i just want to add that
there are many problems that we found uh
during the uh
exploration of the adele construction
architecture uh
the many community members have seen
that uh
that they
won't be able uh to
uh
uh to
withdraw uh
their tokens for the farming as you
didn't mention
uh their
other problems as uh
bad partners uh who
can say stole the tokens and uh the
community cannot
uh ask them uh to
take uh tokens back on the
treasury and we decided to to
to implement uh
such dell constructor to um
to solve those problems and here uh we
market the main problems that current
system has because the current uh
currently uh the system has on the
few points that you you should have uh
100 000 to
to submit your proposal
uh secondly you can uh make a short
description there
and nothing
so uh here's a
well structured solution uh that usually
suggested uh to implement
like a crm system uh that can
solve this task there will be a
responsible persons uh who
who community can choose so
uh
let me show it then
uh just
yeah
the
treasures spending yeah
so uh here is it maybe uh will be better
if i share another presentation maybe
you will be better if i show the figma
uh structure
uh
just
just a moment
just are you guys designing the stuff
together right
yeah
in just a moment
so here is a figma
moment
here's the pink one
loving the new haircut roman
yeah yeah just just give me a moment
here is it
so yeah uh
so uh we can compare uh what uh we have
uh now
uh on the everdal
platform
so if all there uh you'll find that
uh the current
system is quite simple
uh there's no responsible persons for
this proposals so communities should i
should find the relevant person and most
of them are uh defy and representatives
or core development teams uh our
solution helps to
to uh
all teams maybe new teams or some teams
from the community join this platform
uh apply here and be selected as a
verified team this merit
system
uh
all communities could see their merit uh
can we trust them or maybe we should not
trust them
and cetera um
so uh if you see here as i mentioned
that it's quite simple
uh description nothing else uh we
uh we want to suggest make it more
um
more understandable for the uh for the
users for the newcomers who has
one hundred thousand tokens on the bats
but it is not uh only this
uh eat uh
yeah what what your internet's kind of
going out
uh
no it's okay
[Music]
okay it's okay right now uh okay just
just repeat the last sentence
uh yeah uh
i i mean that uh he will be selected as
an initiator
yeah and the initiator
can suggest uh the primary team who will
be responsible to implement the solution
yes
so uh secondly uh he should uh the
initiator should uh input
the stages
uh the uh dates of the start of this
proposal uh he should input the budget
after stages
and
he can
add more stages or
there might be only one stage as well
yeah
so uh the next uh there will be a task
we'll uh on the fire and finally we will
get the task uh there will be a
responsible person uh for this proposal
um
there'll be a
few tasks that he should uh he should do
for example
allocate funds something or
for example hire a manager find a
agency or promote ever scale let's say
uh
in china or any other country
uh
this uh proposal this will be divided
for the few stages uh they might be not
only one uh initiator of this contract
because uh as we describe it in the uh
in the dow architecture that uh
another point uh of the problem that uh
now uh all uh community members has uh
100 000 uh errors on their wallet so uh
this solution also helps to to make
uh to make a pool uh
in the smart contract uh they put uh for
example let's say uh 5 000 errors uh
for 20 people they allocate all funds
here there and initiator of the contract
can submit a proposal
this uh this all these stages
yeah and finally he can provide the
information about himself
that's all
regarding the uh full architecture
crm system i can say cryptocrm system
okay that's great i love the the new
everdao
website and it's it's intuitive it's
clear it's well organized i think it's
great for new users
and what you've just just
told us about the the pool where people
can just put in 5 000 instead of having
like a really high barrier i think
that's a great idea to lower the entry
cool thank you for everyone does anybody
have questions
uh
well
yeah i have i have a few um so
like i i you're proposing like a
enhancement for the user experience of
creating proposals
like just to allow a community to
submit their own their own like
initiative and that that's really cool
and
yeah
had you been
had you already talked talk about was
like smart contract developers or was
maybe uh everdao developers on
so
uh do you have any feedbacks from
community
can you please share what
like what feedbacks do you have or maybe
like um
yeah that
maybe oh yeah we actually collect that
we actually collect the feedback
uh from the community it's already
posted on the forum everyone can uh
participate for discussion there uh
regarding uh developer system uh
i always as a community manager i always
since launch of the free throne expert
on i always suggested that such system
should be implemented in a
real uh golf 2.0 uh system and
uh
as we see that uh
it works
works quite well and
there are a few steps that can help make
it better and better and so of course if
someone has a suggestion
welcome
on the forum and suggest the idea
cool
i also want to clarify so imagine that
someone submits the stages the budgets
and the
nominates the initiators etc etc raises
the pool and the proposal for example
initial proposal is voted and the budget
for the first stage is allocated and uh
like uh is it possible
like to stop the funding if something
goes wrong
so
yeah uh as we describe it in the
proposal because uh here just uh
templated of the
of our suggestion on the forum uh they
describe it uh
more deeply uh that there will be two
options uh for that uh of course the
community can vote uh for the for the
for the stop uh the stage uh if
something went wrong
and uh
another they'll be like uh like uh i
suggested uh in the analytic uh in
supports of guardians that
uh they should be like a guaranteer a
smart contract that can
uh
they can stop uh such project purchases
uh
if
for example partner or the team uh is
doing something bad let's say
okay so anytime community can vote with
tokens
uh like
50 plus one percent right
uh there's no like 50 plus one uh at
this moment their
quorum of 5 million tokens
on every doll
yeah there is no uh 15 plus one anymore
yeah i mean i mean to stop to stop to
stop the the funding uh you need like
the decision to be like yes so
like you
you need people to be like active right
and uh to vote on stopping something
yeah uh people will be active uh of
course if there will be a sd ever uh
implementation because uh we made our
own research that there are many people
uh who has
uh quite a lot of errors on their
wallets but they uh won't be able to
vote for the proposal because they're
they're in farming or and staking and it
takes some times uh to to withdraw money
and vote for this this is the ever of
course it's uh it can bring us uh many
waters on the other dawn
yeah actually no actually
uh like yeah i will write maybe one
forum
some some technical like uh suggestions
on how can you engage people who locked
their friends funds somewhere else like
but but it's it it it actually will need
some collaboration with with dex uh
developers like if you imagine if dex
developers would give you some token
which would be a proof that you are
staking some amount of money in their in
their farm then then you can use that
token in in in the governance as well
and if you have this oracle who
uh like oracle contract who will provide
the
the the information that that this like
token costs
some amount of errors
uh on the market and then then you
actually have like this utility to the
world
but but yeah that's a little bit
complicated system i think and uh
yeah and maybe you have some speaking of
time frames
how how do you think how soon can we
launch an mvp maybe without this this
technical uh
like st ever and and stuff but but just
basic implementation uh how do you think
uh how soon we can launch it and then
the another question is how will it work
together with current implementation so
do you want to replace or do you want
just to create a separate now
uh
regarding the first question uh
i don't like this word
uh
i can say that uh it might be uh
implemented very fast depends on the
community needs
because we have enough resources in the
ecosystem
and in the free town actually we had
such resources
uh but we didn't
and uh
regarding the uh
questions
will be happy if you provide the
feedback on the forum and
of course we could uh invite the
technical guys
to comment it as well
ben did you have a question
uh i did it was kind of covered there
but i suppose just just uh to get a kind
of shorter summary from your roman um
you mentioned that the uh the kind of
threshold the quorum there was five
million ever if i heard you right
no yeah the current uh
system
so
just wondering um kind of how that
figure was decided upon i mean by what
the kind of short simpler version of um
why why 5 million specifically because
yeah
to ask the difficult questions that that
seems
kind of like i can i can take that i can
take this place
so the the the everdao currently is just
a fork of bridge down and it has the
same totally the same numbers so uh on
the bridge thou you have you have the
same quorum and and then the same
proposal cost so they they just didn't
change the numbers but anytime you can
submit a proposal to change this and uh
yeah so so it's fully configurable
so
yeah yeah i think i think roman just
said that that currently we have the
thresholds
yeah so i was just kind of thinking you
know uh big big drama worst case
scenario um
obviously in the way it's set up then
there's no hypothetical way where some
malevolent doctor evil type could come
by what would it be
i mean a little over two million dollars
worth of uh ever
and then lambast the the dell system
with changes to obviously uh
you know uh perform some sort of
dastardly deed yeah in the current set
up that that wouldn't
really be possible is what you said i
think that community can vote uh to
to decrease uh such amount of tokens uh
if they're needed and well no what i
worry is i mean obviously now now that
everscale is growing and you know
scaling infinitely two million dollars
is
you know to some people it could be
quite a small price to
perform
much much bigger
because there should be
in my opinion in my own opinion that uh
they should uh
be able to vote not on the community
members maybe in wales uh if they want
and if you take a look and the other uh
blockchain systems and other projects
like uh uh trust wallet this is exactly
why i asked because i know that they
have the new lands yeah well yeah i mean
i know you have your unique swap in
itself um unless i'm kind of mixing
things but uh was subject to uh quite a
few very ridiculous proposals which went
through uh thanks to some twitter
influencer who wanted to wind people up
and had too many uni swap tokens there
dropped to him
so you know i just yeah i mean obviously
if that figure's flexible and he's you
know kind of in tune with the the amount
of usage and the amount of tokens on the
system then yeah that would answer kind
of the question and appease my english
paranoia thank you very much guys
and actually i i'd like to remind that
there also is a like another model of uh
voting uh like decision making algorithm
called soft majority voting but mitch is
not here so i'm for i will be like uh
i'm very familiar with smg and all the
uh lectures i've had on it from each
other just just just i just wanted to
remind you that it's already uh like in
production it will be actually maybe
used in in some future like
projects
very soon i'm under nga but but very
soon and uh also yeah and uh and yeah i
just want to remind the concept of
person b so so you have this like pool
of maximum votes and you have this
tokens and uh if somebody is like uh
against
then the the amount of votes you need to
raise votes for
uh the amount of votes for you need to
collect
raises with the amount uh so the more
people votes no the more people should
uh votes
yes to to to make this happen and if
nobody and if nobody
votes
negative then you need just 10
people to vote
uh for
to to make the decision happen so you
don't need this threshold of 50 plus fun
like you you need only to like 10 10
people who will agree and if nobody like
wants to
like votes vote no if if nobody cares
then decision just made and if somebody
votes like no some five percent people
then you need like five or ten percent
more people just to to to beat them and
uh and uh so this will this uh this is a
solution for uh the low participation
problem yeah absolutely just uh just how
debt in-depth you're going with your
answers literally it tells me that this
is uh something you guys have thought
about and thought about and i say it's
different obviously you know with doing
the uh the podcast and all that kind of
thing you know i look at a lot of these
kind of more ridiculous things that do
happen and yeah i don't
yeah brilliant work guys again thank you
very much i think uh the main problem is
not uh regarding the ivan uh suggestion
i think the main problem is not uh
regarding the smd
and uh the soft majority volunteer and
so on the main problem is implementation
who will do that
we can vote for the many proposals you
can suggest whatever you want but the
main problem who will implement it
yeah yeah that's that's uh like uh i am
uh again i'm referring to the bitcoin
platform let's create a bounty let's
create an issue for that let's uh like
uh do an open call to all of the
developers
from from bitcoin team we will have the
marketing support for uh this this could
be
uh this could become a actually a task
for a hackathon so
we can engage people to participate and
motivate them with funds
i think ivan we could cooperate in that
way because there are needs a verified
team uh who should be able uh to
implement uh this proposal yeah let's do
it let's do in my opinion yeah in my
opinion just uh implementation of this
proposal is main problem because i've
seen in preton that we can vote for many
proposals they might be accept but the
main problem is that
who will be implemented
i mean just as a side note i'm sure you
guys already know but there's um kind of
models coming out at the minute and uh
i won't name names but uh there was one
particularly uh vitalik was tweeting
about which
again i'm not sure it's any better than
other models but this is definitely
quite unique yeah so yeah a non-token
based down model so an interesting thing
people are looking at at the minute so
yeah sorry i i keep interrupting like
this it's a one-on-one conversation
sorry back to you
jeff thanks that's a great idea roman
and ivan yeah collaborate on that and
see how much see if you can get some
more developer activity and some tasks
actually
completed because everybody has tons of
ideas but who
who's really going to do it yeah
that's great thank you for sharing that
and uh and uh
next up
um
fiddle dee dee
crumpets and tea
it's time for bits dodgy cheeky bits
awaited
for ye
oh
i feel special again thank you thank you
jacob i hope you weren't up too late
writing that all right i'll be honest my
bits disappoint after that beautiful bit
of poetry i've i've only picked up a
couple of top ones for you because i
mean
you know the the secret sauce is here
i'm getting all of this from the
everscale telegram news feed and the
twitter which you know yeah you're all
following anyway aren't you so i'm just
reminding you of stuff you already know
really uh but yes the things which
caught my eye um there was a w ever
airdropped uh for ether blah blah blah
two two two two cubes were dropped um
there were two uh everest everest ever
grants not ever scale grants evergrants
uh receivers receives this week uh
identics and i'm maybe pronouncing this
incorrectly spatium
seems like it should be pronounced
spatium um but yeah both very
interesting projects uh obviously as
we've just been talking about everdao um
there was a very busy day the other day
we had i believe it was 11 separate
issues being voted on and i think the
vote may have closed before this call
today but definitely worth checking out
seeing how it works i've got involved in
a couple myself it's yeah we're all
learning as we go along you know don't
think it's rocket science to get
involved in these things
and we need you obviously as you know
all of this has just been said
and the final thing i want to selfishly
close on uh the never mind these coins
rumor mill uh again been working really
really really hard for you guys out
there with this one um it's going out
three times a week monday wednesday
friday it's it's shortish i mean the
last couple have been a little bit
longer because we've been adding i've
been adding a little bit more value
content on direct market analysis and
such uh but yes myself uh anastasia who
some of you may know we are literally
going now and kind of half an hour
before the show starts we are going
through all the latest kind of crypto
gossip or the headlines all the things
which might move markets and importantly
you know kind of uh giving a lot of
attention to what we we're doing here on
everscale attracting an outside audience
so
um basically if you're not watching it
you're missing out really yeah i'm
trying to do something nice for you so
watch it check it out it's like 10
minutes every three days and then you
don't have to bother with a load of
other
which which just tells you the same news
but in a really boring way
so yeah that's it for my bits go and get
out of it
bloody brilliant ben thank you very much
so let's move on to q a as anybody on
the call have any questions
if not we can move on to youtube i know
some things were sent through
um yeah if i'm a
quick announcement and a quick question
so announcement
on may 25 27 in washington d.c everscale
is participating in the government
blockchain association
seminar for
u.s lawmakers yes ladies and gentlemen
we will be teaching congressmen and
senators of the united states of america
on blockchain
so um a part of that uh seminar will be
an art show a digital art show
uh and a vote
now everscale is conducting that vote
and this will be the first ever in
history 100 percent on chain
end to end decentralized
zero knowledge snark
based voting
thanks to all the people who are helping
put that together so i would like all
nft teams
on everscale to come and present their
works so that they can be voted on and
support that event so
please write to me all of you
who do have nft-related projects i will
help you um submit your works and make
sure that they are voted on as well so
25 27 of may uh the deadline to submit
is a week before so basically this week
i know everyone's busy but please pay
attention
and second uh just an announcement on
another project um we definitely need uh
some people who are experienced as i
wrote in a message in the chat
in uh rfld network nodes and in
your last
module so if you do have relevant
publish please reach out we need your
help thank you joanne back to you
thank you very much eugene
so our questions uh we're gonna have one
for daniela if you're still around um
somebody from youtube would like to know
what do you mean by scam money and why
is it dangerous
uh yeah actually i just
replied to
um i think alex say
so the scam money is actually the coins
that were obtained by deception and uh
the problem is you're asking why it's
dangerous so the crypt and the money is
not dangerous but it actually affect and
impact to your wallet and um other
centralized providers will see that
these monies come from the dark part of
the crypto and you just get banned
that's all
and there's nothing to worry about
except being banned for your entire
balance
um yeah
yeah
okay and what will aml do after all
transactions become private zk snarks is
coming soon as i know
actually i
i
i'm not get it um i know
what is like private transaction because
like uh if you're talking about the off
chains you could do like any of change
that you want
but in sometimes you have you have to
wind your money to your bank account or
your credit card and to exchange your
money to other crypto and in this point
at this point you are have to dealing
with the crypto exchange platforms in
any case if even if they decentralize so
at this case you will uh show them
all that the money that you receive from
the private transaction and they will
like
see is it okay or not anyway and they
will decide is it ex
accepted them or not
indeed
and last question is what if i receive
money from a poisoned wallet then i
return them all back in a short time
will my wallet be spoiled as well or it
will be fine as i returned all the money
yeah actually so how's crypto crypto
works uh so the crypto transaction is
consists of the inputs and outputs yeah
and if you're receiving for to your
wallet this kind of spoiled inputs you
have to be
really really careful to send back the
exact inputs that you just received
because for example you just received
100 uct and your world have 500 and you
just
send the 100 usd back but they actually
mixed and you just sent
like some parts of your money or even
entire parts of your money and you just
like mixed uh the spoiled money with
your own and that's what your entire
world gets get spoiled so you have to
pick uh by hand the exact inputs that
you just received and send them back in
this case you you are safe but it's like
not particular like your entire wallet
you say if you have some reputation that
you just receive this money and send
them back it's some kind impact your
wallet but not as much as you just like
mix all this money and send it around to
other other wallets
yes
worth checking first
yeah
and actually what i want wasn't
mentioned that if you send money to the
spoiled wallet uh as well your wallet
can be spoiled because you are dealing
with the
um like illegal services
so that's mean
you have the bad reputation as well so
be careful to send money
yep
okay thank you daniela i don't think we
have any other questions
once twice nope okay i think that's all
thank you everybody for coming thank you
for the great presentations and have a
wonderful rest of your week
thank you so much guys
yeah bye bye
bye
