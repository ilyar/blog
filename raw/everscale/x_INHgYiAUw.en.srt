think all of that is a topic that we're
going to probably circle background

602
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
going to probably circle background
 

603
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,750

so that that's really interesting but
for the audience to follow uh i think we

632
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
for the audience to follow uh i think we

uh and with this third form of money you
 

649
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,509
uh and with this third form of money you
can do plenty of interesting things uh

that's sort of already leading us in
 

719
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,509
that's sort of already leading us in
into the next question but but first of

720
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,519
into the next question but but first of
 

721
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,030
into the next question but but first of
all sergey yeah i'll be short

722
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
all sergey yeah i'll be short
 

723
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,949
all sergey yeah i'll be short
maybe intriguing thought but

724
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959

um alexi coming coming back to your

750
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
um alexi coming coming back to your
 

751
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,750
um alexi coming coming back to your
point i think

752
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:17,760
point i think
 

753
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,829
point i think
what are the implications of that so

754
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:19,839
what are the implications of that so
 

755
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,150
what are the implications of that so
that you've said effectively the loser

756
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,160
that you've said effectively the loser
 

757
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,870
that you've said effectively the loser
in all of that is the traditional banks

758
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:24,880
in all of that is the traditional banks
 

759
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,750
in all of that is the traditional banks
so

760
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:25,760
so
 

761
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,710
so
what

762
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
what
 

763
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,790
what
exactly what are the implications for

764
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
exactly what are the implications for
 

765
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,269
exactly what are the implications for
those traditional banks and the knock-on

766
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
those traditional banks and the knock-on
 

767
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,509
those traditional banks and the knock-on
effects to the users of the traditional

768
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519

of stuff
 

807
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,750
of stuff
now uh

808
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:25,760
now uh
 

809
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,509
now uh
we have a

810
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:27,519
we have a
 

811
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,550
we have a
like a

812
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
like a
 

813
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,670
like a
the circle go back again and the banks

814
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
the circle go back again and the banks
 

815
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,550
the circle go back again and the banks
are losing part of the business if the

816
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
are losing part of the business if the
 

817
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,430
are losing part of the business if the
if everyone will use

818
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,440
if everyone will use
 

819
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,110
if everyone will use
cbdc's

820
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120
cbdc's
 

821
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,829
cbdc's
which will be basically

822
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
which will be basically
 

823
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,150
which will be basically
digits in central bank

824
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
digits in central bank
 

825
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,990
digits in central bank
so bank

826
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
so bank
 

827
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,629
so bank
lost their liquidity and start to do the

828
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:48,639
lost their liquidity and start to do the
 

829
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,509
lost their liquidity and start to do the
real job and uh that's why in many

830
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
real job and uh that's why in many
 

831
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,470
real job and uh that's why in many
countries banks are at the opposite side

832
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:54,480
countries banks are at the opposite side
 

833
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,430
countries banks are at the opposite side
of the discussion of that particular

834
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
of the discussion of that particular
 

835
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,110
of the discussion of that particular
discussion

836
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120
discussion
 

837
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,389
discussion
um if i may i think if we boil it down

838
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399
um if i may i think if we boil it down
 

839
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,350
um if i may i think if we boil it down
again

840
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
again
 

841
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,949
again
what will this create is a

842
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:04,959
what will this create is a
 

843
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,710
what will this create is a
disintermediation

844
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720

10 euros and they can issue 80 90

850
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
10 euros and they can issue 80 90
 

851
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,230
10 euros and they can issue 80 90
depends on how much the multiplier they

852
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,240
depends on how much the multiplier they
 

853
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,990
depends on how much the multiplier they
are allowed once cbdc goes into effect

854
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
are allowed once cbdc goes into effect
 

855
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,670
are allowed once cbdc goes into effect
that will end

856
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
that will end
 

857
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,269
that will end
as far as i see it or at least there is

858
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
as far as i see it or at least there is
 

859
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,269
as far as i see it or at least there is
nothing in place to allow commercial

860
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
nothing in place to allow commercial
 

861
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,350
nothing in place to allow commercial
banks to keep on issuing more money

862
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:25,360
banks to keep on issuing more money
 

863
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,949
banks to keep on issuing more money
right so

864
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
right so
 

865
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,710
right so
in a way you can say that commercial

866
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:28,720
in a way you can say that commercial
 

867
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,389
in a way you can say that commercial
banks are going to face

868
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:30,399
banks are going to face
 

869
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,389
banks are going to face
unfair competition from their own

870
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,399
unfair competition from their own
 

871
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,230
unfair competition from their own
regulator because they cannot do what

872
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,240
regulator because they cannot do what
 

873
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,110
regulator because they cannot do what
they can do nowadays so that is

874
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
they can do nowadays so that is
 

875
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,710
they can do nowadays so that is
we're going to go into a situation where

876
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
we're going to go into a situation where
 

877
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,110
we're going to go into a situation where
i think most of the smaller banks will

878
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
i think most of the smaller banks will
 

879
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,949
i think most of the smaller banks will
be cut out of a lot of the business that

880
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
be cut out of a lot of the business that
 

881
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,389
be cut out of a lot of the business that
they currently do

882
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
they currently do
 

883
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,790
they currently do
and probably some of the banking leaders

884
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800
and probably some of the banking leaders
 

885
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,990
and probably some of the banking leaders
out there

886
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,000
out there
 

887
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,870
out there
i don't know jp in the in in the u.s so

888
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:50,880
i don't know jp in the in in the u.s so
 

889
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,030
i don't know jp in the in in the u.s so
gen in europe so on and so forth will

890
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
gen in europe so on and so forth will
 

891
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,269
gen in europe so on and so forth will
still have their share of the pie but

892
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:55,279
still have their share of the pie but
 

893
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,350
still have their share of the pie but
the small guys within the banking sector

894
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
the small guys within the banking sector
 

895
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,430
the small guys within the banking sector
will probably suffer the grant

896
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,440

 

897
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,189

any other comments guys

898
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:03,199
any other comments guys
 

899
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,029
any other comments guys
well the curious question right now back

900
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
well the curious question right now back
 

901
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,429
well the curious question right now back
back to the panelists is uh

902
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:07,439
back to the panelists is uh
 

903
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,110
back to the panelists is uh
i know would

904
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
i know would
 

905
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,949
i know would
would regulate us want to get in that

906
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:10,959
would regulate us want to get in that
 

907
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,590
would regulate us want to get in that
space you know of competing with their

908
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
space you know of competing with their
 

909
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,150
space you know of competing with their
their local financial systems the banks

910
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
their local financial systems the banks
 

911
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,029
their local financial systems the banks
or would they then issue um you know

912
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
or would they then issue um you know
 

913
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,750
or would they then issue um you know
cbdc's to the banks right like how it's

914
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:21,760
cbdc's to the banks right like how it's
 

915
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,669
cbdc's to the banks right like how it's
traditionally done right now central

916
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:23,679
traditionally done right now central
 

917
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,069
traditionally done right now central
bank prints money distributes it to the

918
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,079
bank prints money distributes it to the
 

919
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,789
bank prints money distributes it to the
bank and and charges a very low interest

920
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:28,799
bank and and charges a very low interest
 

921
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,029
bank and and charges a very low interest
rate and then the banks you know sort of

922
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:31,039
rate and then the banks you know sort of
 

923
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,710
rate and then the banks you know sort of
uh so banks can't print money by the way

924
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
uh so banks can't print money by the way
 

925
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,470
uh so banks can't print money by the way
yeah you know and so then it gets

926
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,480
yeah you know and so then it gets
 

927
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,390
yeah you know and so then it gets
distributed all right so i think the the

928
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,400
distributed all right so i think the the
 

929
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,230
distributed all right so i think the the
problem with the cbdc is that once the

930
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,240
problem with the cbdc is that once the
 

931
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,909
problem with the cbdc is that once the
central bank issues it you cannot do a

932
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919
central bank issues it you cannot do a
 

933
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,150
central bank issues it you cannot do a
multiplier on it i cannot reissue more

934
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,160
multiplier on it i cannot reissue more
 

935
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,390
multiplier on it i cannot reissue more
currency i cannot lo you cannot give me

936
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
currency i cannot lo you cannot give me
 

937
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,390
currency i cannot lo you cannot give me
10 euros and i give 90 as a loan

938
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
10 euros and i give 90 as a loan
 

939
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,230
10 euros and i give 90 as a loan
because it is issued centrally so there

940
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
because it is issued centrally so there
 

941
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,990
because it is issued centrally so there
is a problem with the multiplier effect

942
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,000
is a problem with the multiplier effect
 

943
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,310
is a problem with the multiplier effect
when it comes to the commercial banks so

944
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
when it comes to the commercial banks so
 

945
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,470
when it comes to the commercial banks so
right now i haven't maybe there is a

946
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
right now i haven't maybe there is a
 

947
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,549
right now i haven't maybe there is a
solution out there but i have not heard

948
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
solution out there but i have not heard
 

949
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,390
solution out there but i have not heard
it you know as an economist out there or

950
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
it you know as an economist out there or
 

951
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,310
it you know as an economist out there or
maybe i haven't read enough about it but

952
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,320
maybe i haven't read enough about it but
 

953
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,710
maybe i haven't read enough about it but
that is a problem that no one has pro i

954
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:02,720
that is a problem that no one has pro i
 

955
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,630
that is a problem that no one has pro i
think addressed so far

956
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:04,640
think addressed so far
 

957
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,909
think addressed so far
interesting point

958
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
interesting point
 

959
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,100
interesting point
back to you sorry

960
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,110
back to you sorry
 

961
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,470
back to you sorry
[Laughter]

962
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:08,480
[Laughter]
 

963
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,470
[Laughter]
anybody else on that one

964
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
anybody else on that one
 

965
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,350
anybody else on that one
well

966
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
well
 

967
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,630
well
the interesting thing is uh

968
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
the interesting thing is uh
 

969
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,270
the interesting thing is uh
if cbdc's come into effect

970
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280
if cbdc's come into effect
 

971
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,830
if cbdc's come into effect
then not only banks lose underst on the

972
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
then not only banks lose underst on the
 

973
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,990
then not only banks lose underst on the
idea that we've already seen and heard

974
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000
idea that we've already seen and heard
 

975
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,830
idea that we've already seen and heard
here which is basically you don't you no

976
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:23,840
here which is basically you don't you no
 

977
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,789
here which is basically you don't you no
longer require deposit-based money but

978
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:26,799
longer require deposit-based money but
 

979
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,669
longer require deposit-based money but
also

980
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
also
 

981
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,390
also
if

982
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400
if
 

983
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,950
if
there is proper access to this cbdc

984
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:30,960
there is proper access to this cbdc
 

985
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,070
there is proper access to this cbdc
ledger then anybody can be a bank right

986
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
ledger then anybody can be a bank right
 

987
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,070
ledger then anybody can be a bank right
that's the whole original idea of crypto

988
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080
that's the whole original idea of crypto
 

989
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,909
that's the whole original idea of crypto
that be your own bank

990
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:37,919
that be your own bank
 

991
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,630
that be your own bank
and but this is very much dependent on

992
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:40,640
and but this is very much dependent on
 

993
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,870
and but this is very much dependent on
the implementation of the ledger and the

994
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
the implementation of the ledger and the
 

995
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,510
the implementation of the ledger and the
way it will be handled and i think this

996
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
way it will be handled and i think this
 

997
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,750
way it will be handled and i think this
will be this will differ from region to

998
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:47,760
will be this will differ from region to
 

999
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,909
will be this will differ from region to
region from country to country

1000
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
region from country to country
 

1001
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,830
region from country to country
but in practice nothing stops a tao from

1002
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840
but in practice nothing stops a tao from
 

1003
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,669
but in practice nothing stops a tao from
being a very good like bank

1004
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
being a very good like bank
 

1005
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,630
being a very good like bank
like

1006
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:58,640
like
 

1007
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,909
like
issuing loans like very effectively

1008
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:01,919
issuing loans like very effectively
 

1009
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,190
issuing loans like very effectively
so in that sense there is a big wave of

1010
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,200
so in that sense there is a big wave of
 

1011
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,470
so in that sense there is a big wave of
disruption of banking in general

1012
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
disruption of banking in general
 

1013
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,830
disruption of banking in general
that's possible but i also worry that um

1014
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:11,840
that's possible but i also worry that um
 

1015
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,470
that's possible but i also worry that um
a lot of that energy will be hampered by

1016
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480
a lot of that energy will be hampered by
 

1017
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,950
a lot of that energy will be hampered by
regulation because banks have a big seat

1018
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:16,960
regulation because banks have a big seat
 

1019
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,789
regulation because banks have a big seat
at the table and they will probably push

1020
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
at the table and they will probably push
 

1021
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,470
at the table and they will probably push
back against it pretty hard so we might

1022
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,480
back against it pretty hard so we might
 

1023
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,549
back against it pretty hard so we might
see we might actually see a model in

1024
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:22,559
see we might actually see a model in
 

1025
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,390
see we might actually see a model in
which you will not be able to access

1026
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:24,400
which you will not be able to access
 

1027
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,390
which you will not be able to access
your currency without a bank account

1028
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,400
your currency without a bank account
 

1029
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,750
your currency without a bank account
even though you actually don't need it

1030
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:29,760
even though you actually don't need it
 

1031
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,150
even though you actually don't need it
so that's the way i see it right now

1032
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
so that's the way i see it right now
 

1033
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,549
so that's the way i see it right now
essentially there is there is disruption

1034
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
essentially there is there is disruption
 

1035
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,029
essentially there is there is disruption
but also there is banks have a seat at

1036
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
but also there is banks have a seat at
 

1037
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,830
but also there is banks have a seat at
the table and it's going to be a long

1038
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:39,840
the table and it's going to be a long
 

1039
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,669
the table and it's going to be a long
fight to

1040
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
fight to
 

1041
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,909
fight to
bring a more

1042
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:43,919
bring a more
 

1043
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,430
bring a more
a more efficient system with less

1044
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,440
a more efficient system with less
 

1045
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,350
a more efficient system with less
intermediaries

1046
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,360

1047
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,830

okay slightly different definitions it's
a stable coin in that it is the country

so it's obviously it's better accounting

1110
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:02,240
so it's obviously it's better accounting
 

1111
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,909
so it's obviously it's better accounting
better control

of printed paper

1250
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,240
of printed paper
 

1251
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,430
of printed paper
and

1252
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,440
and
 

1253
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,230
and
when times get tough governments just

1254
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,240
when times get tough governments just
 

1255
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,430
when times get tough governments just

00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:57,440
print money
 

1257
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,630
print money
uh at least with digital coins uh you

1258
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:00,640
uh at least with digital coins uh you
 

1259
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,950
uh at least with digital coins uh you
don't have that same sort of situation

1260
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
don't have that same sort of situation
 

1261
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,669
don't have that same sort of situation
so you could argue that that digital

1262
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:05,679
so you could argue that that digital
 

1263
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,390
so you could argue that that digital
coins are much much uh better for the

1264

coins are much much uh better for the
 

1265
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,510
coins are much much uh better for the

things are done properly where you have

1296
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,080
things are done properly where you have
 

1297
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,430

one
 

1299
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,950
one
unit of measurement and you have to have

1300
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:48,960
unit of measurement and you have to have
 

1301
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,750
unit of measurement and you have to have
the

1302
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:49,760
the
 

1303
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,990
the
something to back it up you know i'm not

1304
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
something to back it up you know i'm not
 

1305
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,830
something to back it up you know i'm not
sure the world wants to go

1306
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:53,840
sure the world wants to go
 

1307
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,630
sure the world wants to go
back to to that standard because

1308
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:56,640
back to to that standard because
 

1309
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,070
back to to that standard because
most of the economies that we have right

1310
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,080
most of the economies that we have right
 

1311
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,510
most of the economies that we have right
now

1312
00:24:59,510 --> 00:24:59,520
now
 

1313
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,909
now
most of them are inflated we are living

1314
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919
most of them are inflated we are living
 

1315
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,149
most of them are inflated we are living
in a big bubble that's why the crypto

1316
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:04,159
in a big bubble that's why the crypto
 

1317
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,630
in a big bubble that's why the crypto
industry is where it is right now

1318
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:06,640
industry is where it is right now
 

1319
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,909
industry is where it is right now
so cbdc's will be inflated just the same

1320
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:09,919
so cbdc's will be inflated just the same
 

1321
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,230
so cbdc's will be inflated just the same
way

1322
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,240

 

1323
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,190

and what about exchange rates so

1324
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,200
and what about exchange rates so
 

1325
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,269
and what about exchange rates so
at the moment exchange rates

1326
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:17,279
at the moment exchange rates
 

1327
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,430
at the moment exchange rates
supply demand one currency against

1328
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:19,440
supply demand one currency against
 

1329
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,110
supply demand one currency against
another currency that's just going to be

1330
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,120
another currency that's just going to be
 

1331
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,470
another currency that's just going to be
the same with uh with cbdc's

1332
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:24,480
the same with uh with cbdc's
 

1333
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,549
the same with uh with cbdc's
well and an exchange rate is basically

1334
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:26,559
well and an exchange rate is basically
 

1335
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,950
well and an exchange rate is basically
how much money is in circulation and

1336
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:28,960
how much money is in circulation and
 

1337
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,789

else how will this work who will manage

1400
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:37,600
else how will this work who will manage
 

1401
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,510
else how will this work who will manage
these bridges will this be like an

1402
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:39,520
these bridges will this be like an
 

1403
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,830
these bridges will this be like an
international cooperation or will it

1404
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:41,840
international cooperation or will it
 

1405
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,029
international cooperation or will it
just be a

1406
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:43,039
just be a
 

1407
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,870
just be a
probably a big mess

1408
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:44,880
probably a big mess
 

1409
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,630
probably a big mess
so this is something that we are about

1410
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:46,640
so this is something that we are about
 

1411
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,830
so this is something that we are about
to discover

1412
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:47,840
to discover
 

1413
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,710
to discover
but

1414
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
but
 

1415
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,430
but
to just very quickly add on i think that

1416
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:51,440
to just very quickly add on i think that
 

1417
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,870
to just very quickly add on i think that
cptcs are

1418
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
cptcs are
 

1419
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,950
cptcs are
first and foremost were conceived as a

first and foremost were conceived as a
 

1421
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,110
first and foremost were conceived as a
reactionary

1422
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,120
reactionary
 

1423
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,470
reactionary
type

1424
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:00,480

 

1425
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,870

as a reaction to essentially the crypto

1426
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:02,880
as a reaction to essentially the crypto
 

1427
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,430
as a reaction to essentially the crypto
market i think there was this idea that

1428
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:05,440
market i think there was this idea that
 

1429
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,870
market i think there was this idea that
you will just have

1430
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:06,880
you will just have
 

1431
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,029
you will just have
all of these stable coins and people

1432
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:09,039
all of these stable coins and people
 

1433
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,950
all of these stable coins and people
will use them because they just believe

1434
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:10,960
will use them because they just believe
 

1435
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,630
will use them because they just believe
that they work even though they aren't

1436
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:12,640
that they work even though they aren't
 

1437
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,029
that they work even though they aren't
really covered or people just sort of

1438
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:15,039
really covered or people just sort of
 

1439
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,950
really covered or people just sort of
believe they're covered and that

1440
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:16,960
believe they're covered and that
 

1441
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,269
believe they're covered and that
essentially lets you print money without

1442
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:19,279
essentially lets you print money without
 

1443
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,269
essentially lets you print money without
a license and this can potentially be

1444
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:21,279
a license and this can potentially be
 

1445
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,870
a license and this can potentially be
dangerous for the sovereignty of your

1446
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:22,880
dangerous for the sovereignty of your
 

1447
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,389
dangerous for the sovereignty of your
nation's money

1448
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:24,399
nation's money
 

1449
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,950
nation's money
and everything else is just a fight

1450
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:26,960
and everything else is just a fight
 

1451
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,029
and everything else is just a fight
essentially we're going to have the

1452
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:29,039
essentially we're going to have the
 

1453
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,710
essentially we're going to have the
biggest fight for financial privacy

1454
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:32,720
biggest fight for financial privacy
 

1455
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,110
biggest fight for financial privacy
in the history of the world in the next

1456
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,120
in the history of the world in the next
 

1457
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,590
in the history of the world in the next
10 years so we either we retain some

1458
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:37,600
10 years so we either we retain some
 

1459
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,990
10 years so we either we retain some
financial privacy or all of it will be

1460
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,000
financial privacy or all of it will be
 

1461
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,029
financial privacy or all of it will be
gone

1462
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:41,039
gone
 

1463
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,870
gone
this is the biggest danger in my opinion

1464
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
this is the biggest danger in my opinion
 

1465
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,870
this is the biggest danger in my opinion
of cbdc's because they can just be

1466
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:44,880
of cbdc's because they can just be
 

1467
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,750
of cbdc's because they can just be
designed as a solution to something that

1468
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:47,760
designed as a solution to something that
 

1469
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,230
designed as a solution to something that
seems like an urgent problem

1470
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:50,240
seems like an urgent problem
 

1471
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,990
seems like an urgent problem
and then it's it's like some of the

1472
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,000
and then it's it's like some of the
 

1473
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,909
and then it's it's like some of the
coronavirus measures like privacy was

1474
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:53,919
coronavirus measures like privacy was
 

1475
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,750
coronavirus measures like privacy was
never taken into account and that's what

1476
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:55,760
never taken into account and that's what
 

1477
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,430
never taken into account and that's what
i'm personally afraid of

1478
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:57,440
i'm personally afraid of
 

1479
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,070
i'm personally afraid of
that we will just have a system that

1480
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,080
that we will just have a system that
 

1481
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,029
that we will just have a system that
fully

1482
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:01,039

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,510
it probably 99 of the transactions
are digitally

1514
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:33,520
are digitally
 

1515
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,070
are digitally
made in korea already

made in korea already
 

1517
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,990
made in korea already
and then the government actually

1518
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,000

network
so like

1550
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:08,159
so like
 

1551
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,230
so like
in opposite like government

1552
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:10,240
in opposite like government
 

1553
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,470
in opposite like government

1557
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,630
thing
so

1558
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:14,640
so
 

1559
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,750
so
in korea it's more like they have to do

1560
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:17,760
in korea it's more like they have to do
 

1561

1564
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:22,640
maybe there's benefit or something it's
 

1565
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,990
maybe there's benefit or something it's
more like that

1566
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,000
more like that
 

1567
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,190
more like that
their mission

1568
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:25,200
their mission
 

1569
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,870
their mission
to accomplish

1570
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:26,880
to accomplish
 

1571
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,269
to accomplish
i i think you're probably right in that

1572
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:29,279
i i think you're probably right in that
 

1573
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,510
i i think you're probably right in that
most central banks see this is a space

1574
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:31,520
most central banks see this is a space
 

1575
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,430
most central banks see this is a space
they've got to be doing something in

1576
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:33,440
they've got to be doing something in
 

1577
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,269
they've got to be doing something in
rather than they want to be doing

1578
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:35,279
rather than they want to be doing
 

1579
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,590
rather than they want to be doing
something in but nevertheless there are

1580
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:37,600
something in but nevertheless there are
 

1581
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,110
something in but nevertheless there are
a load of

1582
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,120
a load of
 

1583
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,350
a load of
uh good opportunities if if they're

1584
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,360
uh good opportunities if if they're
 

1585
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,750
uh good opportunities if if they're
going to get involved and play but

1586
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:43,760
going to get involved and play but
 

1587
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,310
going to get involved and play but
you talked about cash and and

1588
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:46,320
you talked about cash and and
 

1589
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,110
you talked about cash and and
how little that is used nowadays what we

1590
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,120
how little that is used nowadays what we
 

1591
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,590
how little that is used nowadays what we
found around the world for the last

1592
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:51,600
found around the world for the last
 

1593
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,590
found around the world for the last
couple of years of lockdowns and and

1594
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:53,600
couple of years of lockdowns and and
 

1595
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,149
couple of years of lockdowns and and
everything else

1596
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:56,159
everything else
 

1597
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,630
everything else
was it telescoped many many things it

1598
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:58,640
was it telescoped many many things it
 

1599
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,549
was it telescoped many many things it
telescopes the use of

1600
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:00,559
telescopes the use of
 

1601
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,310
telescopes the use of
uh zoom

1602
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:02,320
uh zoom
 

1603
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,029
uh zoom
or video conferencing it telescopes the

1604
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:05,039
or video conferencing it telescopes the
 

1605
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,149
or video conferencing it telescopes the
use of cashless payments even the shops

1606
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:08,159
use of cashless payments even the shops
 

1607
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,470
use of cashless payments even the shops
that were open in the uk

1608
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:10,480
that were open in the uk
 

1609
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,950
that were open in the uk
had signed up saying not accepting cash

1610
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:12,960
had signed up saying not accepting cash
 

1611
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,549
had signed up saying not accepting cash
because it was dirty everybody was

1612
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:14,559
because it was dirty everybody was
 

1613
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,830
because it was dirty everybody was
touching it

1614
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:15,840
touching it
 

1615
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,549
touching it
so it's telescoped even the people that

1616
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:18,559
so it's telescoped even the people that
 

1617
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,630
so it's telescoped even the people that
didn't particularly want to be moving

1618
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:20,640
didn't particularly want to be moving
 

1619
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,549
didn't particularly want to be moving
over to to paying uh with credit card or

1620
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:24,559
over to to paying uh with credit card or
 

1621
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,389
over to to paying uh with credit card or
or something simple not even talking

1622
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:26,399
or something simple not even talking
 

1623
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,310
or something simple not even talking
about about cryptos or stable coins but

1624
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:30,320
about about cryptos or stable coins but
 

1625
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,269
about about cryptos or stable coins but
it sort of moved that whole space

1626
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:33,279
it sort of moved that whole space
 

1627
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,870
it sort of moved that whole space
and i think the

1628
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:34,880
and i think the
 

1629
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,470
and i think the
uh

1630
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:36,480
uh
 

1631
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,110
uh
the whole environment has just got

1632
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,120
the whole environment has just got
 

1633
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,630
the whole environment has just got
quicker and quicker

1634
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:40,640
quicker and quicker
 

1635
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,669
quicker and quicker
and so

1636
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:41,679
and so
 

1637
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,630
and so
as the the private sector moves ever

1638
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:44,640
as the the private sector moves ever
 

1639
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,389
as the the private sector moves ever
more quickly the government sector is

1640
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:46,399
more quickly the government sector is
 

1641
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,630
more quickly the government sector is
now sort of rushing along to try and

1642
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:48,640
now sort of rushing along to try and
 

1643
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,470
now sort of rushing along to try and
play catch-up

1644
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:50,480
play catch-up
 

1645
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,510
play catch-up
so

1646
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:51,520
so
 

1647
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,990
so
i guess

1648
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,000
i guess
 

1649
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,750
i guess
well maybe it's a question

1650
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:55,760
well maybe it's a question
 

1651
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,750
well maybe it's a question
better left towards the end but i'm

1652
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:57,760
better left towards the end but i'm
 

1653
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,149
better left towards the end but i'm
going to ask it now anyway so

1654
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:00,159
going to ask it now anyway so
 

1655
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,350
going to ask it now anyway so
are we seeing cbdc's

1656
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:03,360
are we seeing cbdc's
 

1657
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,830
are we seeing cbdc's
as as a type of stablecoin

1658
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:05,840
as as a type of stablecoin
 

1659
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,310
as as a type of stablecoin
or are you seeing it as something quite

1660
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,320
or are you seeing it as something quite
 

1661
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,990
or are you seeing it as something quite
separate

1662
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:10,000
separate
 

1663
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,630
separate
so we we touched upon what a private

1664
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:12,640
so we we touched upon what a private
 

1665
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,269
so we we touched upon what a private
stablecoin is it's it's tethered to

1666
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:15,279
stablecoin is it's it's tethered to
 

1667
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,269
stablecoin is it's it's tethered to
dollar or euro

1668
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:17,279
dollar or euro
 

1669
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,750
dollar or euro

efficient and it's much more faster
 

1719
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,830
efficient and it's much more faster
right from from that perspective i think

00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:26,480
collateralize them into like nfts and
 

1999
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,630
collateralize them into like nfts and
put them by them and put them in their

put them by them and put them in their
 

2001
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,430
put them by them and put them in their

we got a bunch of cash just in case of

00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:35,680
we got a bunch of cash just in case of
 

2007
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,430
we got a bunch of cash just in case of
an emergency if there's some kind of

2008
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:37,440
an emergency if there's some kind of
 

2009
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,589
an emergency if there's some kind of
liquidation crunch if the price of the

2010
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:39,599
liquidation crunch if the price of the
 

2011
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,670
liquidation crunch if the price of the
token suddenly drops or if we just need

2012
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:41,680
token suddenly drops or if we just need
 

2013
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,390

cash on hand to buy something you know

2014
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:44,400
cash on hand to buy something you know
 

2015
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,270
cash on hand to buy something you know
because

2016
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,280
because
 

2017
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,870
because
we have to sell

2018
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:46,880
we have to sell
 

2019
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,750
we have to sell
say eth or ever tokens but we don't need

2020
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:49,760
say eth or ever tokens but we don't need
 

2021
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,349
say eth or ever tokens but we don't need
to do that and disrupt the market when

2022
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:51,359
to do that and disrupt the market when
 

2023
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,510
to do that and disrupt the market when
we have literal cash on hand we can go

2024
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:53,520
we have literal cash on hand we can go
 

2025
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,910
we have literal cash on hand we can go
buy something as a doubt

2026
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:55,920
buy something as a doubt
 

2027
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,870
buy something as a doubt
so i think in that sense that cbdc is if

2028
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:58,880
so i think in that sense that cbdc is if
 

2029
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,310
so i think in that sense that cbdc is if
implemented

2030
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:00,320
implemented
 

2031
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,990
implemented
the way i believe should be interpreted

2032
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:02,000
the way i believe should be interpreted
 

2033
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,829
the way i believe should be interpreted

they will become a seamless part of web3

2038
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:08,240
they will become a seamless part of web3
 

2039
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,670
they will become a seamless part of web3
and i think that's the best possible

2040
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:09,680
and i think that's the best possible
 

2041
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,349
and i think that's the best possible
outcome because then we have all these

2042
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:11,359
outcome because then we have all these
 

2043
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,910
outcome because then we have all these
emergent situations all these emergent

so in a nutshell

2052
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:20,800
so in a nutshell

uh movement
 

2059
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,630
uh movement
is expected by in my opinion to uh

2060
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:28,640
is expected by in my opinion to uh
 

2061
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,230
is expected by in my opinion to uh
displace these directly backed tokens

2062
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:32,240
displace these directly backed tokens
 

2063
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,069
displace these directly backed tokens
but they will still kind of live around

2064
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:34,079
but they will still kind of live around
 

2065
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,950
but they will still kind of live around
if incentivized and web3 will definitely

2066
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:36,960
if incentivized and web3 will definitely
 

2067
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,790
if incentivized and web3 will definitely
eat a lot of the cbdc's and put it into

2068
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:40,800
eat a lot of the cbdc's and put it into
 

2069
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,550
eat a lot of the cbdc's and put it into
like existing blockchains

2070
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:42,560
like existing blockchains

okay and moving on if we can because i'm

2072
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:44,400
okay and moving on if we can because i'm
 

2073
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,630
okay and moving on if we can because i'm
very mindful of time moving on a bit

00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:46,640
very mindful of time moving on a bit
 

2075

more away from the theoretical and

2076
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:49,359
more away from the theoretical and
 

2077
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,990
more away from the theoretical and
looking more at the technical so what

2078
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,000
looking more at the technical so what
 

2079
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,310
looking more at the technical so what
about the actual implementing uh cbdc's

2080
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:56,320
about the actual implementing uh cbdc's
 

2081
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,150
about the actual implementing uh cbdc's
on blockchain

2082
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,160
on blockchain
 

2083
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,430
on blockchain
in both

2084
00:38:59,430 --> 00:38:59,440
in both
 

2085
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,069
in both
a developed financial market and in more

2086
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:02,079
a developed financial market and in more
 

2087
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,630
a developed financial market and in more
of a frontier or emerging

2088
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:04,640
of a frontier or emerging
 

2089
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,710
of a frontier or emerging
financial market are the differences

2090
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:06,720
financial market are the differences
 

2091
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,310
financial market are the differences
between the two and how would you go

2092
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:08,320
between the two and how would you go
 

2093
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,230
between the two and how would you go
about it and how easy or how difficult

2094
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:10,240
about it and how easy or how difficult
 

2095
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,870
about it and how easy or how difficult
it is talk us through that a little bit

2096
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:12,880
it is talk us through that a little bit
 

2097
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,950
it is talk us through that a little bit
maybe papal that's that's probably

2098
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:14,960
maybe papal that's that's probably
 

2099
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,589
maybe papal that's that's probably
one for you to start with okay yeah

2100
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:17,599
one for you to start with okay yeah
 

2101
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,670
one for you to start with okay yeah
yeah this is quite a different angle but

2102
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:19,680
yeah this is quite a different angle but
 

2103
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,870
yeah this is quite a different angle but
essentially uh the issue here is scale

2104
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:22,880
essentially uh the issue here is scale
 

2105
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,910
essentially uh the issue here is scale
so a cbdc cannot be built on a on a

2106
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:25,920
so a cbdc cannot be built on a on a
 

2107
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,910
so a cbdc cannot be built on a on a
blockchain that has the same kind of

2108
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:27,920
blockchain that has the same kind of
 

2109
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,710
blockchain that has the same kind of
consensus rules and is built to

2110
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:30,720
consensus rules and is built to
 

2111
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,870
consensus rules and is built to
be massively redundant and massively

2112
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:32,880
be massively redundant and massively
 

2113
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,310
be massively redundant and massively
distributed mostly because

2114
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:35,320
distributed mostly because
 

2115
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,910
distributed mostly because
theoretically the number of transactions

2116
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:37,920
theoretically the number of transactions
 

2117
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,349
theoretically the number of transactions
you can have on a cbdc network can be

2118
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:41,359
you can have on a cbdc network can be
 

2119
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,829
you can have on a cbdc network can be
in the millions per second

2120
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:43,839
in the millions per second
 

2121
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,870
in the millions per second
so

2122
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:44,880
so
 

2123
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,870
so
i think uh that cpcs as they scale will

2124
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:48,880
i think uh that cpcs as they scale will
 

2125
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,109
i think uh that cpcs as they scale will
probably use similar approaches that

2126
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:51,119
probably use similar approaches that
 

2127
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,510
probably use similar approaches that
have been uh sort of researched by

2128
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:53,520
have been uh sort of researched by
 

2129
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,950
have been uh sort of researched by
traditionally centralized blockchains

2130
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
traditionally centralized blockchains
 

2131
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,550
traditionally centralized blockchains
which is potentially modularity

2132
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:58,560
which is potentially modularity
 

2133
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,870
which is potentially modularity
either that or we will have like a very

2134
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:00,880
either that or we will have like a very
 

2135
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,470
either that or we will have like a very
small set of authorities that

2136
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:04,480
small set of authorities that
 

2137
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,470
small set of authorities that
run big huge data centers like visa does

2138
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:08,480
run big huge data centers like visa does
 

2139
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,390
run big huge data centers like visa does
and they will process an enormous number

2140
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:10,400
and they will process an enormous number
 

2141
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,390
and they will process an enormous number
of transactions since this is

2142
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:12,400
of transactions since this is
 

2143
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,069
of transactions since this is
essentially

2144
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:14,079
essentially
 

2145
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,470
essentially
uh this is essentially a system that

2146
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:16,480
uh this is essentially a system that
 

2147
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,069
uh this is essentially a system that
looks like a blockchain

2148
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:18,079
looks like a blockchain
 

2149
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,790
looks like a blockchain
and has interfaces like a blockchain but

2150
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:20,800
and has interfaces like a blockchain but
 

2151
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,190
and has interfaces like a blockchain but
is controlled by one entity by one

2152
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:23,200
is controlled by one entity by one
 

2153
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,349
is controlled by one entity by one
government then it can be basically run

2154
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:25,359
government then it can be basically run
 

2155
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:26,870
government then it can be basically run
on a server farm or a bunch of server

2156

on a server farm or a bunch of server
 

2157
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,829
on a server farm or a bunch of server
farms so in the end if

2158
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:29,839

2159
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,870

if countries decide to distribute this

2160

then it will have to be modular in scope

2164
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:38,240
then it will have to be modular in scope
 

2165
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,150
then it will have to be modular in scope
like it will have to settle through

2166
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,160
like it will have to settle through
 

2167
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,910

if and this is more likely in the
 

2171
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,349
if and this is more likely in the
beginning it still stays as a tightly

2175
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,710

it will probably be run on a bunch of

2176
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:50,720
it will probably be run on a bunch of
 

2177
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,430
it will probably be run on a bunch of
government data centers and then it will

2178
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:53,440
government data centers and then it will
 

2179
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,030
government data centers and then it will
not really have the same kind of scaling

2180
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,040
not really have the same kind of scaling
 

2181
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,030
not really have the same kind of scaling
issues that blockchains have nowadays

issues that blockchains have nowadays
 

2183
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,430
issues that blockchains have nowadays
because it is essentially just a big

politics work
 

2253
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,109
politics work
how the elections work it could be a

2254
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:33,119
how the elections work it could be a
 

2255
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,349
how the elections work it could be a
really terrific

2256
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:35,359
really terrific
 

2257
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,270
really terrific
that's my opinion on that

2258
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:37,280
that's my opinion on that
 

2259
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,109
that's my opinion on that
i usually like to boil down things very

2260
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:39,119
i usually like to boil down things very
 

2261
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,510
i usually like to boil down things very
simply as you're you're getting the gist

2262
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:41,520
simply as you're you're getting the gist
 

2263
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,150
simply as you're you're getting the gist
so all we're talking about really is um

2264
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
so all we're talking about really is um
 

2265
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,150
so all we're talking about really is um
centralized electronic money

2266
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:46,160
centralized electronic money
 

2267
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,470
centralized electronic money
with a ledger that that that's that's

2268
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:48,480
with a ledger that that that's that's
 

2269
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,309
with a ledger that that that's that's
all we're talking about cbdc

2270
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:50,319
all we're talking about cbdc
 

2271
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,109
all we're talking about cbdc
so

2272
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:51,119
so
 

2273
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,990
so
it has needs to have two functions one

2274
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:54,000
it has needs to have two functions one
 

2275
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,430
it has needs to have two functions one
this will operate in a very highly

2276
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:55,440
this will operate in a very highly
 

2277
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,109
this will operate in a very highly
regulated environment

2278
00:42:57,109 --> 00:42:57,119
regulated environment
 

2279
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,670
regulated environment
with with certain abilities to be able

2280
00:42:59,670 --> 00:42:59,680
with with certain abilities to be able
 

2281
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,390
with with certain abilities to be able
to change money in circulation so right

2282
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:02,400
to change money in circulation so right
 

2283
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,309
to change money in circulation so right
now fiat are based

2284
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:04,319
now fiat are based
 

2285
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,630
now fiat are based
on government intervention if we need to

2286
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:06,640
on government intervention if we need to
 

2287
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,230
on government intervention if we need to
intervene there's always something

2288
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:08,240
intervene there's always something
 

2289
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,829
intervene there's always something
available so we need to leave that

2290
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:09,839
available so we need to leave that
 

2291
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,750
available so we need to leave that
intervention in place otherwise there's

2292
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:11,760
intervention in place otherwise there's
 

2293
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,349
intervention in place otherwise there's
not going to be any uptake by any

2294
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:13,359
not going to be any uptake by any
 

2295
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,550
not going to be any uptake by any
governments

2296
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:14,560
governments
 

2297
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,270
governments
and second if we're going to design say

2298
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:17,280
and second if we're going to design say
 

2299
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,630
and second if we're going to design say
for example ever to be a cbdc to to be a

2300
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:20,640
for example ever to be a cbdc to to be a
 

2301
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,030
for example ever to be a cbdc to to be a
chain the transat cbdc

2302
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,040
chain the transat cbdc
 

2303
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,270
chain the transat cbdc
we need to also keep in mind once we

2304
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:25,280
we need to also keep in mind once we
 

2305
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,430
we need to also keep in mind once we
design it around say for example let's

2306
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:27,440
design it around say for example let's
 

2307
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,109
design it around say for example let's
say the maltese or the british

2308
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:29,119
say the maltese or the british
 

2309
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,750
say the maltese or the british
government that once we designed it for

2310
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:31,760
government that once we designed it for
 

2311
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,550
government that once we designed it for
this government it is interoperable with

2312
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:34,560
this government it is interoperable with
 

2313
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,710
this government it is interoperable with
other chains out there so those two

2314
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:36,720
other chains out there so those two
 

2315
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,630
other chains out there so those two
things might not go hand in hand or when

2316
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:38,640
things might not go hand in hand or when
 

2317
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,150
things might not go hand in hand or when
you program one you might not think of

2318
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,160
you program one you might not think of
 

2319
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,349
you program one you might not think of
the other but if you don't think of both

2320
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:43,359
the other but if you don't think of both
 

2321
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,030
the other but if you don't think of both
at the same time then you're going to

2322
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,040
at the same time then you're going to
 

2323
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,109
at the same time then you're going to
run into problems later down the line

2324
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:47,119
run into problems later down the line
 

2325
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,630
run into problems later down the line
and personally

2326
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:48,640
and personally
 

2327
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,710
and personally
i think that

2328
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:50,720
i think that
 

2329
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,069
i think that
this we're not going to live in a world

2330
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:52,079
this we're not going to live in a world
 

2331
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,030
this we're not going to live in a world
where

2332
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:53,040
where
 

2333
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,030
where
everyone is going to go to the to around

2334
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:55,040
everyone is going to go to the to around
 

2335
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,270
everyone is going to go to the to around
table and we're going to develop cbdc's

2336
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:57,280
table and we're going to develop cbdc's
 

2337
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,510
table and we're going to develop cbdc's
that are interoperable but

2338
00:43:59,510 --> 00:43:59,520
that are interoperable but
 

2339
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,510
that are interoperable but
we're going to get specific regions

2340
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:01,520
we're going to get specific regions
 

2341
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,589
we're going to get specific regions
because of the geopolitical scenario

2342
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:03,599
because of the geopolitical scenario
 

2343
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,790
because of the geopolitical scenario
that adopt their cbdc for example

2344
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:06,800
that adopt their cbdc for example
 

2345
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,190
that adopt their cbdc for example
russia china and the cis region will

2346
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:09,200
russia china and the cis region will
 

2347
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,950
russia china and the cis region will
develop their own they come back

2348
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:10,960
develop their own they come back
 

2349
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,109
develop their own they come back
together because they do not speak maybe

2350
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:13,119
together because they do not speak maybe
 

2351
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,190
together because they do not speak maybe
to the western countries and we're going

2352
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:15,200
to the western countries and we're going
 

2353
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,950
to the western countries and we're going
to get a hodgepodge

2354
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:16,960
to get a hodgepodge
 

2355
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,349
to get a hodgepodge
of cbdc's that later down the line we're

2356
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:19,359
of cbdc's that later down the line we're
 

2357
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,950
of cbdc's that later down the line we're
going to have a problem to make

2358
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:20,960
going to have a problem to make
 

2359
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,030
going to have a problem to make
interoperable between themselves and

2360
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:23,040
interoperable between themselves and
 

2361
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,790
interoperable between themselves and
obviously i might be wrong but this is

2362
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:24,800
obviously i might be wrong but this is
 

2363
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,069
obviously i might be wrong but this is
my view of the world

2364
00:44:28,069 --> 00:44:28,079

 

2365
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,550

well i think back back to dave and paul

2366
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:30,560
well i think back back to dave and paul
 

2367
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,790
well i think back back to dave and paul
bell's earlier point right

2368
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:32,800
bell's earlier point right
 

2369
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,109
bell's earlier point right
cbdc is all about trust right and i

2370
00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:35,119
cbdc is all about trust right and i
 

2371
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,510
cbdc is all about trust right and i
think you know and on on your point how

2372
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:37,520
think you know and on on your point how
 

2373
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,670
think you know and on on your point how
do you implement it properly

2374
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:39,680
do you implement it properly
 

2375
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,710
do you implement it properly
um

2376
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:40,720
um
 

2377
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,630
um
i think it's got a lot to do with know

2378
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:42,640
i think it's got a lot to do with know
 

2379
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,550
i think it's got a lot to do with know
the the oracles the data that you

2380
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:44,560
the the oracles the data that you
 

2381
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,710
the the oracles the data that you
integrate right because ultimately no

2382
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:46,720
integrate right because ultimately no
 

2383
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,150
integrate right because ultimately no
currency is

2384
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:48,160
currency is
 

2385
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,710
currency is
is decided you know on on interest rates

2386
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:50,720
is decided you know on on interest rates
 

2387
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,829
is decided you know on on interest rates
on on

2388
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:51,839
on on
 

2389
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,990
on on
on inflation and economies makes those

2390
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:54,000
on inflation and economies makes those
 

2391
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,829
on inflation and economies makes those
kind of complicated you know so-called

2392
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:55,839
kind of complicated you know so-called
 

2393
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:58,870
kind of complicated you know so-called
calculations right now to to estimate uh

2394
00:44:58,870 --> 00:44:58,880
calculations right now to to estimate uh
 

2395
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,270
calculations right now to to estimate uh
how much you know a currency is worth

2396
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:01,280
how much you know a currency is worth
 

2397
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,349
how much you know a currency is worth
and then how do you combat against

2398
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:03,359
and then how do you combat against
 

2399
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,950
and then how do you combat against
inflation or deflation and all these

2400
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:04,960
inflation or deflation and all these
 

2401
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,190
inflation or deflation and all these
other things right so if implemented

2402
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:07,200
other things right so if implemented
 

2403
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,589
other things right so if implemented
properly and i think cbdc could be

2404
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:09,599
properly and i think cbdc could be
 

2405
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,349
properly and i think cbdc could be
much more efficient you know because

2406
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:11,359
much more efficient you know because
 

2407
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,510
much more efficient you know because
it's algorithm mines and also all the

2408
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:13,520
it's algorithm mines and also all the
 

2409
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,390
it's algorithm mines and also all the
formulas are put in place properly but

2410
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:16,400
formulas are put in place properly but
 

2411
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,309
formulas are put in place properly but
you know like you say do you have you

2412
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:18,319
you know like you say do you have you
 

2413
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,430
you know like you say do you have you
know the necessary data or oracles uh to

2414
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:21,440
know the necessary data or oracles uh to
 

2415
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,190
know the necessary data or oracles uh to
support not that

2416
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:23,200
support not that
 

2417
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,510
support not that
that that algorithm to to again back to

2418
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:25,520
that that algorithm to to again back to
 

2419
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,670
that that algorithm to to again back to
your point make it stable right so what

2420
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:27,680
your point make it stable right so what
 

2421
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,589
your point make it stable right so what
is the definition of stable by the way

2422
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:29,599
is the definition of stable by the way
 

2423
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,589
is the definition of stable by the way
right so i think though

2424
00:45:31,589 --> 00:45:31,599
right so i think though
 

2425
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,750
right so i think though
with with those combination you know and

2426
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:33,760
with with those combination you know and
 

2427
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,470
with with those combination you know and
then if implemented properly uh it could

2428
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:36,480
then if implemented properly uh it could
 

2429
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,470
then if implemented properly uh it could
be you know it could be one of those uh

2430
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:38,480
be you know it could be one of those uh
 

2431
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,990
be you know it could be one of those uh
better cases and i don't think the

2432
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,000
better cases and i don't think the
 

2433
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,069
better cases and i don't think the
difference is between a developed

2434
00:45:42,069 --> 00:45:42,079
difference is between a developed
 

2435
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,150
difference is between a developed
country versus a non-developed country i

2436
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:44,160
country versus a non-developed country i
 

2437
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,430
country versus a non-developed country i
think it's then it's a battle of

2438
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:45,440
think it's then it's a battle of
 

2439
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,710
think it's then it's a battle of
standards

2440
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:46,720
standards
 

2441
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,630
standards
which standards or which protocols you

2442
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:48,640
which standards or which protocols you
 

2443
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,309
which standards or which protocols you
know it's going to be the the most

2444
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:50,319
know it's going to be the the most
 

2445
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,630
know it's going to be the the most
widely adopted protocol and i think the

2446
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:52,640
widely adopted protocol and i think the
 

2447
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,630
widely adopted protocol and i think the
one step that broker is being you know

2448
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:54,640
one step that broker is being you know
 

2449
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,990
one step that broker is being you know
taken by the governments and then i

2450
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:56,000
taken by the governments and then i
 

2451
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,870
taken by the governments and then i
think the interoperability then will

2452
00:45:58,870 --> 00:45:58,880
think the interoperability then will
 

2453
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,309
think the interoperability then will
will be easier to solve because

2454
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:00,319
will be easier to solve because
 

2455
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,550
will be easier to solve because
everybody's using similar protocols and

2456
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:02,560
everybody's using similar protocols and
 

2457
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,309
everybody's using similar protocols and
and so you have similar level of trust

2458
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:04,319
and so you have similar level of trust
 

2459
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,630
and so you have similar level of trust
if i know that you are using a certain

2460
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:06,640
if i know that you are using a certain
 

2461
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,230
if i know that you are using a certain
formula to compute

2462
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:08,240
formula to compute
 

2463
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,309
formula to compute
right the the stability right of your

2464
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:10,319
right the the stability right of your
 

2465
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,069
right the the stability right of your
currency you know versus mine no if

2466
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:12,079
currency you know versus mine no if
 

2467
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,430
currency you know versus mine no if
you're using different protocols or

2468
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:13,440
you're using different protocols or
 

2469
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,470
you're using different protocols or
different standards or ways to to to

2470
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:16,480
different standards or ways to to to
 

2471
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,550
different standards or ways to to to
stabilize our currencies then

2472
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:18,560
stabilize our currencies then
 

2473
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,630
stabilize our currencies then
then that's where the trust is is not

2474
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:20,640
then that's where the trust is is not
 

2475
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,470
then that's where the trust is is not
there anymore right yeah and then i

2476
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:22,480
there anymore right yeah and then i
 

2477
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,069
there anymore right yeah and then i
think back to that question right i

2478
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:24,079
think back to that question right i
 

2479
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,030
think back to that question right i
think so so i guess that whole question

2480
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:27,040
think so so i guess that whole question
 

2481
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:27,710
think so so i guess that whole question
of

2482
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:27,720
of
 

2483
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,109
of
interoperability and cooperation is is

2484
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:31,119
interoperability and cooperation is is
 

2485
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,230
interoperability and cooperation is is
core

2486
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:32,240
core
 

2487
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,430
core
uh

2488
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:33,440
uh
 

2489
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,870
uh
and you have to ask yourself what are

2490
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:34,880
and you have to ask yourself what are
 

2491
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,670
and you have to ask yourself what are
the chances of that happening

2492
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:37,680
the chances of that happening
 

2493
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,030
the chances of that happening
but globally i mean it's it's probably

2494

but globally i mean it's it's probably
 

2495
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,750
but globally i mean it's it's probably
not is it

2496
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:43,760
not is it
 

2497
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,589
not is it

now so so it's four countries coming
together to test it out exactly but but

2502
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:49,920
together to test it out exactly but but
 

2503
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,510
together to test it out exactly but but
four countries not

2504
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:51,520
four countries not
 

2505
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,510
four countries not
270 or 300 and yeah i mean whatever

2506
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:55,520
270 or 300 and yeah i mean whatever
 

2507
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,950
270 or 300 and yeah i mean whatever
that i think we're going to have a

2508
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:56,960
that i think we're going to have a
 

2509
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,710
that i think we're going to have a
hodgepodge of different countries or

2510
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:58,720
hodgepodge of different countries or
 

2511
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,510
hodgepodge of different countries or
different regions coming together but i

2512

different regions coming together but i
 

2513
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,190
different regions coming together but i
think it's a pipe dream and it's going

2514
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:03,200
think it's a pipe dream and it's going
 

2515
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,790
think it's a pipe dream and it's going
to remain as a pipeline for quite a long

2516
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:04,800
to remain as a pipeline for quite a long
 

2517
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,670
to remain as a pipeline for quite a long
time yes unfortunately we see now in the

2518
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:07,680
time yes unfortunately we see now in the
 

2519
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,710
time yes unfortunately we see now in the
world is de globalization so

2520
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:10,720
world is de globalization so
 

2521
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,670
world is de globalization so
supply chains destructions everybody

2522
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:13,680
supply chains destructions everybody
 

2523
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,270
supply chains destructions everybody
fights each other

2524
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:15,280
fights each other
 

2525
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,390
fights each other
uh

2526
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:16,400
uh
 

2527
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,790
uh
dollar become a little bit weaker a

2528
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:18,800
dollar become a little bit weaker a
 

2529
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,150
dollar become a little bit weaker a
little bit weaker every year as you say

2530
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:22,160
little bit weaker every year as you say
 

2531
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,630

now they should rely on the currency

2532
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:24,640
now they should rely on the currency
 

2533
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,430
now they should rely on the currency
that will be backed by real commodities

2534
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:27,440
that will be backed by real commodities
 

2535
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,630
that will be backed by real commodities
like

2536
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:28,640
like
 

2537
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,829
like
metal

2538
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:29,839
metal
 

2539
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,190
metal
oil gold something and uh probably that

2540
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:33,200
oil gold something and uh probably that
 

2541
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,750
oil gold something and uh probably that
will be the trend for next 10 20 years

2542
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:35,760
will be the trend for next 10 20 years
 

2543
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,950
will be the trend for next 10 20 years
so we

2544
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:36,960
so we
 

2545
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,190
so we
probably can't see the

2546
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:39,200
probably can't see the
 

2547
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,990
probably can't see the
whole friendship cbdc for all countries

2548
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:42,000
whole friendship cbdc for all countries
 

2549
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,230

unfortunately yeah
 

2551
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,349
unfortunately yeah
okay so just to wrap up then um

2552
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:47,359
okay so just to wrap up then um
 

2553
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,950
okay so just to wrap up then um
i guess the the bottom line question is

2554
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:50,960
i guess the the bottom line question is
 

2555
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,710
i guess the the bottom line question is
are cbdc's

2556
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:52,720
are cbdc's
 

2557
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,870
are cbdc's

2582
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:18,400
technology to build it
 

2583
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,430
technology to build it
and it can be used to

2584
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:21,440
and it can be used to
 

2585
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,309
