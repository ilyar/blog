everyone is delighted with this event
tell us why you chose this particular
platform
hype city a city of bloggers so far
few people know about hype city but soon
not only free ton
but the entire crypto community will
learn about this platform we will do an
affiliate program with free time
we will generate a lot of content for
free time and this is just the beginning
this event is the starting point i think
we will meet very often
in my opinion the most significant event
for free ton
is the launch of the project itself
after all
it couldn't have taken place but
independent companies got together with
the community and launched this product
that is the project as a whole
i believe that this is the most
significant event for free time
that is its birth in essence
i think freeton's best achievement is
that we move
we are really moving towards
decentralization and we are really
moving towards the fact that in the near
future
the community will manage this project
from this point of view
freeton is the only project in the world
that has attempted to achieve
full decentralization
the main achievement along with the
technical ones
is of course the community this is
primarily
technology the network becomes more
secure
the network becomes more powerful
because more transactions can be
processed
etc at the moment the network is already
ready
for production-ready solutions
sub-management
sub-governments for example b-fair or
nft
are working to present to the world a
solution based on 3-ton
and only free time
