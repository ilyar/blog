by everscale
ladies and gentlemen welcome on stage uh
ceo of broxas vladislav pandamarev
happy birthday of a scale
how are you done today
welcome everyone at our second
anniversary event of everscale network
we have done a really tremendous pass
from a very young and experimental uh
network launched in a fully
decentralized way to a fully grown
project with a lot of
excellent projects and
really passionate community members an
excellent ecosystem
so uh we are going to host a lot of good
speakers today so and a lot of
interesting information for you
but before we begin so let me invite to
this scene so one of the key members of
everscale community so sergey shashf the
founder of broadcast please
[Applause]

everscale foundation
dave pulis the founder of zbex
exchange and member of evascale
foundation
kevin smith the director of capital pi
fund and member of evascale foundation
[Applause]
alexander philadelphia the co-founder of
everex one of the core developers of
everscale network please
[Applause]
uh thank you all who wake up after this
time and don't sleep
and
it's no joke we are asian blockchain
from yesterday
and
nice to see you all
and
i hope that this
country and this region
will be homeland for us thank you
hi
my name is moon from korea i'm an
everscale maximalist and thank you very
much for coming to this wonderful event
of everscale that i believe one of the
very rare blockchain networks that
offers true value to the world
so uh interesting speakers coming up so
please enjoy
uh thank you for being so early this
morning i would call you soldiers you
know compared to the rest
um i'm dave police from zbx the
centralized exchange
centralized not decentralized
um i was brought on to everscale for a
very particular reason and i'm very
honored to be on the foundation
in the last couple of days i've seen
some of the brightest people in the
space
that we have built an excellent product
now it's time to polish the image
polish the identity and reach out for
other businesses other
gaming products for for the game fire
other um
[Music]
businesses out there and i think before
we start to reach out to them we have to
define our identity and then we start
reaching to them one by one we have
built the product first and now we're
going to reach out
unlike many other products out there and
that's why i'm honored to be on the
foundation and we are representing
by far the best product that and chain
hand that has been developed so far
hello and welcome so i think today we're
all going to learn uh a lot more about
everscale and what it is that we're
doing i am also very honoured to be uh
invited to join the
uh the foundation
and
the foundation is there of course to try
and promote uh the the understanding and
the use of everscale
and it's great to be with such um
colleagues on that foundation
and
i think the future is bright as
a certain television advert in the uk
always used to say so lots of countries
from around the world are in this and
the the foundation is going to be
promoting everscale around the world so
welcome enjoy and have lots of fun
thank you
um
it's a second year anniversary forever
scale so i just want to bring a little
bit of historical perspective it's been
i remember very well two years ago when
uh everscale was launched it was
actually called freighton it was right
in the middle of covet so everybody was
at home
and
i i remember that zumkol with uh 23
initial members of frito now everscale
uh with some you know fun kit folks
you know working with some code and then
everybody was like oh here is the first
genesis block of freedom and everybody
is like wow what the hell is that and uh
it was like maybe i don't know 70 people
on the call 80 people something like
that and now it grew into a full-fledged
you know community with about 30 000
people were doing this asia big asia
kickoff thing here in in bali there is
going to be later today a metaverse uh
metaverse party forever scale globally
with nft champagne and ft beer and
everybody is going to have avatar and
our event is going to be projected on
the wall in that metaverse i mean what a
journey it's amazing and i think it's
just a start we're just at the beginning
of something big we're part of this big
web 3 revolution uh we actually call it
web free uh bringing our own pivot to
that whole thing so looking forward to
that together with you folks thank you
very much and let's enjoy the conference
there is going to be a lot of stuff here
thank you
[Applause]
uh and uh everscale uh foundation
foundation is something that a new
entity that uh you see a brilliant
representative of now so who will be
helping to scale
the ever scale even more but uh not only
uh
the leading persons uh are the heart of
the eva scale but also some community
members and we have some of them with us
today from all around the world so let's
see a short video with them
[Music]
congratulations to everscale community
on the second year anniversary
we hope that the new year will be
equally successful and prosperous

made me feel special and also inspired
me to write a bit of myself for you
so bear with me
[Music]
for those here last year
it's been the longest 12 months ever
and whilst our values remain many old
ways we've severed
candles are green our new logo is blue
sort of
as long as you're here tonight

though whatever the weather will feel
clever together
as long as we endeavor to deliver
deliver deliver
the best ever ever
thank you very much and i hope to be a
part of this awesome awesome project and
place and all these people for another
12 months to come and another 12 months
after that hey have a great time
everyone
let's applause to our brilliant
community members and say thank you to
them
for this excellent
wishes to our to our small yet but
really blooming project okay guys uh so
now we have uh a small presentation
about
where the scale has gone in the past
year and where it's going this year
so uh guys can you please put it on
screen
as i said so it was a very interesting
and challenging year so with a lot of
things going on and uh
i think i see this year
personally as a real breakthrough
because we have a lot of good
initiatives a lot of
excellent results uh in terms of
marketing in terms of
popular rising have a scale throughout
the world throughout the blockchain
ecosystem and
getting its place amongst the modern
blockchain
platforms
so let's start with some figures yeah so
not so boring stats
in 2021 so everscale managed to serve
20 million transactions so this is one
of the most
loaded blockchain ever
with it circulating supply
i will i'll speak about this a bit later
so uh
a bit over 1 billion so there are still
some treasury funds
available to
further
boost the ecosystem growth
with over half a million new accounts
created in the network so we are
standing in one of the top five networks
on this ratio
with 64 000 tps we are the number one
this is the most productive network
capable of withstanding any kind of
workload
any kind of complex computations
anything you can imagine can be eaten in
the everscale
and all of this at the excellent speed
of 0.2
blocks per second
second per block sorry
this is just the comparison with
one of the most nearby
i wouldn't say competitors i would say
neighbors in the blockchain ecosystem
so everscale
still
to reveal its true potential to lots of
different projects and uh
we will see a lot of growth a lot of new
initiatives a lot of interesting uh
i don't want to see projects again but a
lot of different
ecosystems to be grown
within everscale itself
let's speak about what actually happened
this year
it was a year of rebranding
and uh initially the project as you know
was called the freighton
because it it took the sources of
original tone network because it has
excellent architecture and we made it
even better
so we fully improved the source code
over the original network and after that
so we
felt that
we are no more linked with the network
because we overcome it
and the new name was chosen it's the
name everscale
why was that like this
because
with all the infinite possibilities and
infinite scalability of the network
possible
there's absolutely anything you can do
on this network
any kind of applications that you can
imagine can fit here
and uh to reflect all of this to reflect
our
blooming ecosystem
our growing
community and all of this so we perform
the full bottom to top rebranding
including not only the name but also all
of our community resources including
different products including our even
our visual identity
you can see just a few examples of
projects key projects in the in the
ecosystem that also performs their
branding following the network itself
and these are just to name in fact there
are dozens dozens of different projects
that followed their branding and they
also updated the
visual guidelines and all of them really
like the name and try to follow it
because it just gives so much
opportunities on different uh marketing
purposes
with a new
really bright and vibrant
color palette so we are really we're
standing and you can even see on these
different uh video materials so how
pretty uh it looks and moreover so we
have selected one of the best
design agencies who have created us to
create a unique style
clearly distinguishing us from all other
blockchain projects
but not only the visual identity took
the place
visual identity update took the place in
the previous year but also it was a year
of upgrades
and uh as any complex blockchain
ecosystem you cannot go without having a
clear standards
as a ground upon which all the projects
are built
and in 2021 we performed
one of the most complex operations ever
and we upgraded all the token standards
for those of you who are not developers
this is just to give you the
understanding so uh
the token standard is something that
made the ethereum great
it allowed
an infinite number of different projects
appearing on that blockchain and
with a clear and uniform
rules on how you identify the token and
how you interact with it so you can make
it universal
and this universal approach so uh let us
to take the best and the maximum of
everscale opportunities of its
architecture of its scalability sharding
and all these
smart words
and make it really convenient for
developers
now we have two standards at least
which allow you to do things that are
not even
imaginable in other networks
you can
create different sets of rules for your
projects within
the blockchain itself
and of course it includes both fungible
and non-fungible tokens
and speaking about non-fungible it's not
only about the digital art this is a
standard that allows you to create
almost
any kind of
certified
non-fungibility on chain
and this is something really unique to
have a scale
also in 2021 we managed to achieve a
much greater connectibility with other
networks because we live now in the
world where
good connection to all of your neighbors
is a key
not so many layer one blockchains has
appeared in the past
year but those who did the blockchains
of new generation all of them understand
clearly that the connectivity is a key
and cross chain is the future
and with this vision in mind so we added
several
big networks
connections to everscale this includes
bnb chain in past binance smart chain
this includes polygon and phantom
this includes
avalanche
and milk omeda which is a layer to over
cardana and including cardano itself by
the way
so we are one of the few blockchains
that connect to cardano now
also we are now in the process of
finalizing the breach to test us
and we will see a number of great names
this year as well
but what makes it different from all
other solutions as well
it's not only meant
for talking and liquidity transfer that
typically most bridges uh to different
networks do
this is all to create a unique
experience for developers who will be
able to create a truly cross-chain
applications using everscale as a
consensus mechanism
they can host their dials here
they can
create a complex metaverse applications
having different blockchains as
different worlds
they can create an infinite number of
gamify
and defy applications that
take the most of the connectivity
because this bridge
that connects all these networks
is not only about token transfer it's
also about all kinds of information
transfer
but what's more is that it is this uh
decentralized in a true fashion so all
of you know that uh this is the
one of the
hills hills here uh that most of the
british are centralized
but unlike the one that connects every
scale to other networks and it's named
octo's bridge by the way
and of course it's security audited
that goes without saying
also in 2021 we had a lot of really
really big events
we totally revamped the way how we work
with different partnerships and
investors
we
have created a new structure called defy
alliance that was aimed at liquidity
providers
work and also at different kind of
listings and representation of everscale
moreover we have done a new thing unique
thing we have contracted the token
supply
ever supply by almost 60
this is done to make the network more
attractive for investors
and we did this for purpose
moreover we have installed a new and
unique program named crystal hands aimed
at the largest investors and liquidity
providers
you see here no
no more place for paper hands
but
the
core of each blockchain ecosystem is
also developers and
we did a lot in 2021 to make them
dive into the everscale ecosystem easily
starting from
the awareness campaigns
that give you at least a knowledge about
whatever scale is and where you should
go to to learn more
you see just a few channels here so what
what was done
but also we have totally uh
redone the
main network website
made it more accessible more logic and
more straightforward so for that any uh
kind of
community member be a developer investor
media or whoever so could easily find
the information and also
approach the right person in the scale
community please keep in mind that we
are decentralizing
in the end and
last but not least so there we have
initiated a few projects to make
an easy onboarding for developers
because uh
although we have different
popular languages used for smart
contracts like solidity for example
there's also
always a need
to understand how to interact with the
network
and
good documentation is a key
the key to new projects to new
initiatives to
self-promotion of the network among
developer community and we are planning
to focus on that even stronger in the
coming year
also we have
upgraded the governance
you know it sometimes it happens when
you have not the right person in the
beginning
so we have
removed all the
people who were not contributing and
selected those persons who are really
focused on ever-scale development and
were investing a lot of their time and
passion so uh and and money
after all
uh to make everscale great and all of
these people so uh have joined now the
ever skill governance
moreover we have upgraded the key
platform used to take decisions on the
scale so now it's truly unchained and it
gives the opportunity to any member of a
scale
using the adverse
the currency to create
and vote
for all kinds of decisions crucial for
for the network
last but not least we have created the
everscale foundation
it's still being incorporated but the
people already here and you have seen
three of them not all of them
unfortunately have uh have made it to
the conference for several reasons but
uh
you will see them more and more often in
the coming year
and this is a structure that aims at
representation of everscale before
different
different market players or say like
this so this will be the single
window where anyone can come and find
anything any information that
they need
just let me introduce you
the members of fskl foundation
so kevin smith you have seen him already
so kevin is a great speaker and uh a
great investment manager so and he has a
really vast experience
and his name is really famous in the
industry so and he will be representing
the european
part of everscale
michael gord
well michael is a famous person in never
scale
so with his fund gda capital he is doing
such a tremendous work in the north
american region and not only
that has brought a lot of really
powerful players into the everscale
network marcelo garcia
founder of crypto explorer initiative
marcelo has a unprecedented
network of contacts
and moreover he
[Music]
is very well aware of how blockchain and
crypto work in latam region
so welcome here on this position
moon
i i can talk a lot about moon so and uh
how much he has done for everscale and
popularization of it uh in korea and
this is my ideal of how the ambassador
should be
and uh of course he has decided
he has earned us his place on the
foundation and he will be representing
the asian region
dave
dave with us already for a couple of
years since since friton times and uh
with his uh exchange and with his
conferences he made a tremendous
uh effort on popularization of everscale
and last but not least a a story there
is a mistake of course it's uh it's
kunal
uh and canal is a great person for uh
representing everscale at middle east
region
so uh
there will be uh dedicated events to
have a scale foundation and uh i think
that we will be releasing a lot of good
news about uh what foundation will do
and how it will structure the
publicity words about have a scale
uh so just keep subscribed to the social
networks
hashtag foundation
uh
a few words about the defy alliance
back in 2020 when uh it was just the
beginning of the network
it was already obvious that
liquidity is a blood of any network
and you need
to really
be really well
aware of how this this market works and
how you should talk to different funds
and liquidity providers and
private even private investors
and that's where the defy alliance has
appeared
it was a group of professional fund
managers
and liquidity providers themselves
who take the flag to
bring
the liquidity to everscale
and this is just a small result of they
work and of course they
have done so much
uh
so many things that
you can cannot even imagine
but uh
just a few things to name that they uh
made
uh the liquidity in a scale almost to
grow almost 10 times for for a period of
one year
they attracted
a lot of new
liquidity providers from different
regions
also uh they
have
leaded the process of pr and marketing
and
fully restructured it so and now you
will see that some metrics on the
following slides
i can continue
like this for a long time but just to
say these are the people who
are the core contributors to ever skill
ecosystem growth
yeah so
also under the management of
the defy alliance we have launched the
grant program for new projects and
already
a few of them have received the funding
and are now creating different kind of
solutions forever scale
but
also uh one of the the key performance
things is as a work with exchanges
in different analytical platforms and
now everscale is present
on all of the popular analytical
trackers so you can find information
about their scale easily and that was a
challenge i would say because everscale
is not evm compatible like any other
network
and with their negotiation skills they
managed to get it natively listed on
those platforms
and that was not uh unnoticed you can
see that there are a lot of publications
about everscale
in top media like not only crypto media
forbes yahoo entrepreneur and a lot of
other names
including
coin telegraph coin desk and
other crypto media so they are
constantly publishing news about
everscale development
and now we are coming to ecosystem and
performance part
let's go and make a step uh before so
and talk about the initiative that is
named rastkalp
for those who of you who are not aware
what this thing was it was one of the
most complex blockchain experiments
ever
the
tone labs now known as evorex team
has created a unique
test network on which they introduced a
new version of nodes that was fully
recreated and introducing a lot of
novelties
and unique features that was allowing
you to achieve
the maximum throughput
in a very aggressive environment
and
in the live tests it was really live
test with terabytes of data loaded in in
the blockchain
they managed to achieve the throughput
of 64 000 transactions per second
just to give you the example all the
visa
ecosystem
all payment solutions can withstand only
000 transactions at peak
and it was achieved only once
so
i'm not saying anything but if visa once
decides to switch its operations to a
blockchain so they know the right
network too
these are just a few names of uh
everscale
has started to appear
so
including the biggest exchanges like
gate io like coin wine like mix c
and a lot of names to come this year
with the biggest payment gateways like
simplex like itas in the coin
changely and others
and also
a whole
constellation of different uh analytical
websites where people typically
try to learn and track their portfolios
and it's very important
we have a
totally
recreated the process of how we approach
developers
starting from
grants programs
we also
started to run different hackathons
and also
fully cover all the key products and key
ecosystem
with the full documentation we have at
least three projects of
documenting different services to make
them easily accessible for developers
and this already resulted in a lot of
good reviews a lot of
activity on
different developer websites and i hope
that this this year we will see a lot of
great names to appear in our ecosystem
with the next level marketing so uh in
back in 2020 we used to have dedicated
sub governances to try different
ways of marketing in the more
decentralized way
and uh finally we
took the best of this experience
and implemented in uh the new marketing
approach you can see just few kpis that
we managed to achieve i will not read
them out so you can
see them on the screen
but uh
this is a true 360 marketing
this is something that we that we missed
so badly in the first year of everscale
and now we are it's just only the
beginning
now we have selected the right people
we got the right contacts
and now we will
we are preparing a really massive
marketing campaign in different regions
to make have a scale
really really visible
just to
help newcomers with a lot of information
that is going on about have a scale we
have created a dedicated wiki pages on
our scale website
we have created a lot of introductory
videos that you can
in different languages by the way so uh
we have seen videos uh
not only in english but also in russian
in chinese in japanese in korean
in persian in georgian
in
spanish in portuguese
and these are only ones that i have seen
personally
there are a lot a lot of materials now
about lsql
also we
are playing a lot of different
cross promo activities with big
platforms and big players
uh so i will not spoil it now so please
keep subscribe to social networks
you will see it
uh and of course so uh we are coming to
usage of traditional instruments as well
now let me uh say a word about the core
contributors of a scale
in the very beginning of the network
there were 23 companies that decided
to
launch
its own
blockchain
in an unusual way
typically when you launch a new
blockchain what you do you first write
your white paper you collect money from
investors
after that so you just create some kind
of evm roll up
and you're happy
unlike us
we use our own funds to
create the network and to develop it in
the first year
and until we felt that
the network is good enough
to approach the markets we did not
really push it
but already in beginning of 2021 so
we have seen a lot of uh
ecosystem projects
that have appeared and
all of this are thanks to those
companies
so let me start
well
with broxus
i'm also the ceo of this company so uh
but i will try to be
not biased
so uh brock's had delivered
a really big installation of products
forever scale so and since the very
beginning we were focusing as
a company uh
aimed more at the practical
usage of the blockchain and we
focused on the key defy products like
decks like bridge to other networks like
wallet
similar to metamask
and a lot of different libraries for
developers
and only with two of our products so we
managed to
get the triple digit growth in the past
year
in two of our core projects we have over
70 million
us dollars of liquidity and it's going
even to increase even more
next of course is ever x everex is a
core developer of
everscale protocol itself
these guys have created excellent nodes
that can be used to run
your own validator
and to interact with the network and
build a lot of decentralized
applications on top of it
also they have introduced a
whole set of different
developer toolchains that allow you to
easily hop on the network and start
building right away
this includes also evernote and uh
ton sdk ever sdk sorry
next is it gold it gold is uh is a
company that
is really moving the nft market in a
scale forward
they have a really interesting approach
and they have created one of the largest
uh
nft marketplaces in the scale named
grand bazaar
and but not only so they
are really
they really know how to approach
different uh big projects and make a
collaboration with them so you can see
just a few names here like uh
chess nft like third place uh
and few others that they managed to
achieve for uh in the past year
for edef is a really bright and uh
active developer company so they
are trying they if uh the
[Music]
skills in different areas starting from
launching their own collection of punks
on their scale so that was sold out
i think it's few minutes uh
but also they uh
have created the first landing protocol
on the scale so i really wish luck
to those guys so and i really like what
they're doing
next is ever gaming this is something
what used to be named uh
everscale esports sub governance so a
group of people who
uh just have grown from uh uh
subgovernance into the
really cool product really cool esports
gaming platform and now they uh are
developing like hell
pokertown i i cannot name everscale
without name and pocket on because this
is one of the
uh
core products that was in the network
since the beginning
and it uh it's also one of the largest
poker platforms for telegram uh that can
be played from any device and these guys
use everscale for the true on chain
results
neil foundation is one
of the
core
developers on their scales
after all so they also perform a lot of
audits uh of different projects uh and
products on their scale network
uh
and with the approach so they
managed to move the cryptography in
everscale on the next level
and all of this is just the beginning of
the story i didn't name a lot of other
names but believe me there are dozens of
others who are contributing on a daily
basis
to ever-skill development
so what's going on to be in the next
year
just a few months ago we have migrated
the network to a new version of nodes
and
those of you who are more or less
familiar with how blockchain development
goes so understand the complexity of
this
thing and this achievement
but why
it's crucial
because with new nodes
we unlock a lot of new features of the
scale and finally we can get the maximum
of this network
including the super fast uh
smart uh soft majority fault tolerant
protocol so yeah i named it uh
it will allow us to
radically reduce guest fees
up to 100k 100 times
at the same time to allow us to make gas
really dynamic and to motivate
validators and
network developers
it will allow us to achieve even higher
throughput
and be more protected uh from uh ddos
attacks and replay attacks uh with the
ramp protocol
and this is only one of the few things
to name but of course if you have a look
at the list of features that uh come
with the new notes so
it's much longer
also in this year we are planning to
launch
two new work chains
every skill pretty much like polka dot
and near so allow to
you to create
work chains
with different set of rules this can
also include different virtual machines
that can include
different uh
way of how it it's validated
but two new things to be introduced this
year are
the ones that we desperately need and so
they are already in development the
first one is the evm blockchain
workchain sorry so uh why it's crucial
because thanks to ethereum
there is a huge market of solidity
developers
and to facilitate the hopping on the
everscale network so it's
important
to let them step into the safe
environment and they can easily start
with
evm work chain and port the application
there
it will not be
as productive as
the main network but it will allow the
easy
easy entrance
the drive chain is something that is
really
required for development
of lots of new
applications including also nft
when you need to store a huge amount of
data and now in most of other chains
it's done through the ipfs network and
uh
or simple cloud storage which is not a
true decentralized approach and with the
drive chain we will introduce a truly
genuine
approach
of how can it can be done is
a lot of
data can be stored
in the
in the network
and access on chain of course
also speaking about the defy market in
2021 we have finalized the creation of
the basic layer
but
now
we can move to the next stage
and in the coming year we are planning
to see a lot of new products to appear
and offering a variety of different
financial services
this includes
for example derivatives market futures
options and all that stuff that uh
typical traders
got used to this includes includes the
improved lending and borrowing protocol
that will allow you to create complex on
chain mechanics or easily take
some funds
as a credit
insurance protocol of course to mitigate
your risks because
the more complex solutions appear so the
more crucial it is to have
the insurance
the tokenization framework the dow
builder the improved launch pad and lot
of other things to name so uh we have a
really big agenda for defy this year
pretty much like for nft gamify and
metaverse i put these three together
because they kind of entangled
and
you see that
some parts of them intersect with the
defy market as well
but the ambition for this year for uh
nft stream on nava scale is to create
a set of sdks that will allow you
creation
of
solutions of any kind of uh of any level
of complexity
and uh as everscale is uh
the most productive network so we are
really expecting uh metaverse projects
to uh to come to the network this year
and a few of them already have started
to appear so and i i'm really
encouraging all others to join this
family
also we are planning a big number of
different events this year so ever point
is the beginning
and uh after that so we will
we have agreed already with the git coin
to launch the everscale dedicated
hackathon and we are now in the
preparation for it so it will take place
somewhere in july
and it will be big believe me
also uh we are planning to run
some quarterly hackathons minor ones but
in a big number so in different uh
cities or even online so uh we are
aiming to create a experience for
developers to come participate and feel
upscale their fingertips
also we plan
a really
big development of our grants program
because in 2021 we have set up all the
processes
and now we are ready to move further
i'm not even saying about conferences
everscale will be everywhere
and our representatives will come to all
the major events and
represent
okay
so and speaking about some key metrics
for 2020
too
these are just the minimal things that
we are aiming to achieve
in fact i truly believe that we will
make it even bigger
because no one could expect that we will
deliver 200 200 million transactions in
in the past year
and with a big number of new projects to
come so we really
expect
a higher workload on the network and
really encourage this
and of course number of newcoming
accounts so we'll
just burst
the next year will be the year of of the
focus at the same time so and uh after a
lot of discussions and a lot of uh
negotiations we decided to focus the
development
on several geographies
so one is asian geography
because we managed to achieve really
great results here in asian region
last year and we plan to
deepen the results and make it even
stronger
but also there are a lot of cool
initiatives appearing now in the middle
east
so uh in the coming year we are planning
to make
these markets really blooming
and create a lot of attract a lot of new
communities and community members and
create a lot of projects in this regions
last but not least is is a teaser
for everscale fund
named everfront
so uh i vladimir maslikov will be
speaking about this a bit later today
but just to give you a hint of what the
thing is because some uh some of you may
already have heard something about
everfront
this is a structure that is aiming
to create a unique
funding facility for different projects
managed in a truly decentralized way
on chain
and
aiming at the
those streams
crucial from everscale
network development
okay i will leave this to vladimir uh
because he will be the one one of the
key persons uh on this on this font
so that's pretty easy so guys i hope you
you have not slept
and you have got at least
some uh interesting information about
how everscale have developed
and now just let's make a short coffee
break
and uh after that so we are coming to
the uh
our panel program with a lot of
different speakers and a lot of
interesting topics to cover
okay guys thank you so much for
attention
you
