um
today uh i would like to present you
guys uh there's a denise uh cleaning uh
zachary uh they are representative from
chinese embassy
um
they will tell you more about our uh our
as a project ever scale our explosion on
the chinese market
and
they they will answer you all questions
regarding their future plans what they
are going to do there uh how they are
going to promote their scale
and cetera so denise this is work for
you you can start
we can't hear you
no no
no
it's still now
we can't hear you
this is some technical uh
technical problems let's wait
yeah now we can hear you
hey guys can you hear me yeah yeah we
can hear it
create something yes
okay so shall we start
uh
let me perhaps
uh
share the screen with the presentation
so
yeah
basically just a few words about
us about myself
so uh my name is dennis i'm from uh
venture frontrunner capital we actually
invested in everx which is the core
developer of
everscale and i'm in charge of
asia business development at our fund
so
basically i have been helping uh ever
scale
uh since
uh
well i think for a year and a half
already and
basically my health was focused more on
china so i helped average scale build
the chinese community from scratch
and
basically i can say that this is already
kind of work of
one year so we actively started
in january 2021
so last year
and
yeah so as you
as you may know uh recently
our
funding proposal was approved so
first of all thank you so much everscale
community for that uh we very appreciate
your support and uh
yeah so keep uh we keep working on uh
promoting everscale through on the
chinese market so
i know that um well frankly there were
some different opinions on
chinese sub-governance or chinese
community whether we are
the suitable team for this and uh in
order to address these concerns uh we
decided to
uh
we decided we decided to have this ama
to answer
uh your questions and yeah just to tell
you guys what what what we're planning
to do
um
yes so uh we also have um
another co-leader of our chinese
community uh lee or zachary his english
name i think
many of you are also familiar with him
so he's also in a call and he'll help me
answer some questions so basically
uh
i'm more in charge of strategy and
promotion and lee is more in charge of
technological part he actually has a
team of developers
in cine
and
yeah so
let's
let's tell more about this a little bit
later so in general our proposal is that
uh we uh like we want to keep uh
promoting everscale in china so we are
actually the team that will handle
everything connected with everscale in
china
and we truly believe that within one
year china can really become the largest
market for ever skill one is largest and
uh there are several reasons for this
first of all the chinese still is big
market for china for
a blockchain for crypto
despite all the restrictions etc
and
still very huge market
a lot of
trading volumes uh through d5 platforms
which are not touched by regulation uh
huge metaverse market and what is most
important since everscale is a
uh layer one solution
uh
in china actually
uh
around
50 or 40 of all the web 3 developers are
located in china
so for
layer 1 solutions actually china is a
very very large market
um
just a few words of what we have done so
far so uh we uh well basically the last
year was kind of a preparatory year for
us we we haven't pushed more on
promotion part and did mostly um on the
infrastructure so we
established our
ecosystem chats in telegram and wechat
we uh had several
um promotion articles just to kind of
touch the grounds and we also uh had a
promotion campaign one year ago which
was pretty pretty successful
actually we uh
uh thanks to this campaign we increased
number of users to 5
5 000 users in telegram
but basically now we don't have all of
them so this is kind of a challenge that
i
would like to discuss further um and
another important thing that we
integrated with bsn so
uh
who don't know what bsn is bsn is
actually the chinese
blockchain platform backed by the
chinese government
which is actually the only way for
global
public chains to legally enter the
chinese market and be compliant with the
chinese law
so this is kind of the strategic partner
of our scale in china and we are looking
forward to
leverage
this partner more and more um
of course the integration with psn was
pretty long
but actually this uh also allowed our uh
developer team
uh with lee as its leader to get uh
hands-on experience on every scale
because this is something that we are
really proud of
uh because china i think apart from
russia or ukraine or belarus
communities uh china i think is the only
community which really has
uh web3 developers who can code in
everscale who have hands-on experience
there so this is kind of another driver
for growth
uh but still a lot of challenges so far
uh the main challenges i mentioned that
um uh
that uh our community is not that
vibrant it's not that active uh after uh
the promotion event that we had a year
ago uh
not very many users are actually still
in the community many of them
many of them left
and that is why kind of our community
currently is pretty passive
um that is why
this is kind of the main challenge i
would say uh to make uh to activate the
chinese community to make it vibrant so
i would say that for this year and
specifically for the next 10 months this
is kind of the the main challenge and
the main task and of course we're going
to focus kind of here like a very high
level i would say that our uh
in the next year we will focus more on
promotion we will focus more on
community engagement
basically one of the reasons why the
retention is so low because uh there are
not so many features
like
i would say
in global community there is not that
many features but for chinese community
there are
practically no features that they can
use because nothing well there are a few
applications translated
into chinese
and um
many of the applications kind of they do
not have mobile version which is also
not very user friendly
uh for the chinese users etc and
of course this is kind of this is bad if
we want to retain our users
um
and we want to do more um on bsn because
bsn uh is basically the source of uh use
cases that we were talking some so much
about uh
a year ago and during the whole time so
lee can
later kind of comment on the use cases
because currently after we finished the
integration with bsn
we already got some
uh inbound uh requests from chinese uh
large brands platforms to
uh
build something together with ever scale
kind of nft marketplaces uh some digital
assets solutions etc so this is of cour
of course kind of a opportunity for us
uh yes this is about bsn yes i
perhaps uh if you if you want to comment
just a few things yes
okay yeah
yeah so just add some extra point on
that on the bsn integration yeah as
dennis mentioned
uh currently the the average scale
bsr network
which we're trying to integrate with the
bsn standard nft equivalent standard
which is called ddc
and this is quite popular at this moment
in china because as our
as we know in china
the nft is still a little bit sensitive
at the moment because lots of people
doing this
money for launderings and etc and that's
why the bsn they adopt another name a
toilet alternative name called ddc
decentralized digital certificate yeah
and we are using every scales nft
protocol to integrate with their ddc
standard
which is a little bit hard because our
our scout ft standard is different from
other like ethereum
721 and double one double five so it
takes a few it takes us a few quite a
lot of time at the moment but then once
we integrate together then
we would maybe we can even
promote our
own ift platform and there's already a
quite a few companies which they own ip
intellectual properties and arts
they they come to us and asking when and
how they can
migrate their
ads and and like graphics and images
onto our network
yes back to you dennis
yeah thank you thank you so much lee
yeah just
bsn is a very kind of very powerful ally
for us and we want to leverage it more
and more
um in general i would say that uh in
terms of promotion we will focus more on
two
two main audiences the first one is
crypto traders which we kind of
undermined uh in the broken in last year
and for them we will have well special
amaze we will
have well some moderate airdrops and
basically arrange contests for them
kind of
best
best trader contest etc in cooperation
with crypto media tier 1 chinese crypto
media
and of course exchanges so chinese
exchanges are still one of the largest
exchanges in the world so
uh we also want to uh increase our brand
awareness
for them
yeah so
uh
but also
but but also another in another pretty
uh
pretty important kind of i think uh
the most important uh audience for us is
of course developers chinese numerous
developers uh
web3 developers and for them
we would have also technical amas we
would uh translate most of the
educational materials kind of first of
all tech documentation
secondly
uh webinars and we will make webinars
for the chinese developers to
increase awareness among the chinese
tech community and of course have
tech
hackathons uh tech contests etc
and qls so influencers this is also kind
of the most important part here
yeah just um
these are the kpis for one year
but uh
basically i think that it would be kind
of more practical approach to discuss
our first
stage so uh the plan for two months
because actually uh the funding that uh
the community kindly uh has kindly
provided to us this is for two months to
kind of prove that we can uh use this
funding in a wise way an effective way
to
get some result
so
basically
there are four
major directions that we want to do
first of all
try to revive our communities
try to
uh
attract new users uh to the to the
telegram chats to twitter
and uh
actually make them make them more active
through amaze first of all
uh the most important thing is to work
on messaging because uh previously we
were not kind of pretty sure it wasn't
clear what was the motive what was the
value that everscale can bring to the
chinese users so currently we do we know
what it is basically this is more kind
of uh connected with d5 products with
wallets so something connected with my
money because of course kind of we we
must be honest so
for the chinese the most important thing
is to well how to make money and
this is kind of this reality of course
kind of the decentralization and
technical uh
parameters kind of technical advantages
are also very important for um
for the community as well but the main
kind of motive is of course kind of the
monetization
so
we will uh correct our messaging
uh
we will translate and
create a few uh educational materials
for developers and just try to kind of
promote them and see what is the result
and we want to start
collaborating with qls with a
micro influencers
in china uh another major thing is bsn
tech contest so as i mentioned bsn is a
very powerful ally and this is one of
the things how we can leverage him
uh basically they arranged technical uh
contests for developers um and we
uh we can be part of it uh
basically it works like there is a
contest for
uh several teams who code on everscale
and uh kind of this much
looks like hackathon on everscale but
with bsn branding
and with of course bsn communities for
developers so this is i think one of the
first
good steps that we can make in terms of
brand awareness among developers and
yes would be looking forward to see the
results
still very interested and
kind of
expecting to well kind of intrigued what
would be the results of
the contest so in general here you can
see kpis and basically just to kind of
um remove all the fears that you have
kind of that we do just i don't know a
few amaze translate a few articles and
we're gonna get like uh 165
000 hours just for this no actually this
funding is for achieving these goals so
if we
make a three amaze for example and we
see that the goal isn't achieved
so we try to do something else with this
funding that we have because basically
this funding is for achieving these
goals so yes this is
um
this is our kind of position
so
um
yeah
basically that's um
that's about
our plan so
i would love to hear more questions from
you guys
uh because i know you have many of them
during the voting you had many many
questions
so critics also please welcome would be
happy to answer
uh yeah thank you denise for your
wonderful presentation uh there's a few
questions from all community members
they collected uh during these days
uh
yeah the first question is uh are you
planning to participate or launch uh
hackathons for developers
uh you mean participate so no no
no
well it depends because uh participate
um
uh it would it would make sense to
participate in hackathons as a
co-organizer
uh because obviously hackathons are not
necessarily devoted to ever skills so we
in order to promote our skill we need to
kind of bring the agenda of ever scale
and
educate
participants how to um
how to code on every scale and that is
why i would say that a bsn tech contest
is kind of the first attempt for
such hackathons but in the future we'll
have many of them but they would require
additional resources because
well
we anyway we would need to partner with
some
existing uh tech communities uh we we
know already all of them and
medias for example yes but in general
this is something for the future
for starters it's be a center constant
contest we would kind of touch the
ground test it and see how it goes
lee if i
i know you would also have a few
thoughts about hackathons
please feel free
um
if lee is with us so if not because i i
know i know that lee is also on another
ama so he's kind of a pretty busy guy uh
so if he's not with us so let's just
skip to
another question okay
uh the following question is uh could
you tell us more about the bcn uh
partnership uh
maybe yeah you you could share us this
current status what what they are doing
and
et cetera yeah but basically uh well of
course uh
about b uh s for bsn uh lee is kind of
he has more knowledge on this i can just
tell you um in a
kind of very high level and then when
lee returns he can kind of uh elaborate
on more details but in general i would
say that bsn well as i mentioned bsn is
a the only way for global
public chain to get
into the chinese market
they are supported by uh the chinese
ministry of
information technology
by
union pay which is the paying system i
think many russians know uh know this
paying system
uh
now
uh
and by
chain mobile
um and uh yeah so basically uh they are
operated by the team called red date and
they have a lot of resources in terms of
gr in china so uh
already
around uh well more than 20 public
chains like cosmos near fedora deserts
now already
um already participate in
in evers in the bsn so basically there
are kind of two platforms one is opb
that we have already integrated with
this is basically kind of um
a platform to
uh
kind of the this is the back end based
on everscale
that
allows uh
chinese users to basically use it
because uh since uh
any crypto related stuff tokens are
prohibited in china so
we would need to
to make some amendments make it make
some changes in the current um
ever skilled network
to
to be able to comply with the changes so
we have already did it so we've done it
already integration was successful so
now basically any chinese developer can
use everscale to
build uh
depths
and everybody in china can use it
without vpn without anything
um
yes but but now we plan to integrate
with ddc as lee already mentioned ddc is
a kind of an analogy for nft in china
and this is a kind of huge market so
basically now all the
um all the requests that come from uh
chinese companies thanks to bsn uh they
all coming regarding this ddc project
because this is a very hot topic lee if
you're with us perhaps you can also
comment on this
yes yes
um okay and the other things i can just
add a few points of
what's happening in china at the moment
um
for
for the uh for the current nmt because
in china at the moment the the only
regulated or only thing
allowed in china is to
sell like doing initial sell like the
the the first uh first market not the
secondary now you only can
you can sell the the nft
as the how to say that now you can only
only do the initial offering
you can you cannot resell it yeah you
cannot resell it in china because at the
moment the regulation is not clear it's
not
finite yet that's why
there are lots of platform they're doing
and ft selling
at the moment and they
they're doing this on top of a virus of
different
semi-decentralized blockchain so this is
the blockchain within inside of china
and they're not global and they're not
public
and so we cannot call them decentralized
but they're still selling this nft and
there's a
hundreds of thousands of viewers on
south sold in china every day
and there's some so many
nearly all of the the intellectual
property
companies
and even those um
territories tourist companies
and this heritage company
they're selling these rt gadgets and
and
[Music]
souvenirs like digital souvenirs like as
an mt at the moment so we cannot ignore
this huge market at the moment that's
why there's so many companies
approaching us and asking when
the bsn average scale network could be
online could be alive
and with the ddc
standard ready
yeah so that's what's happening in china
i just i give you you can give back guys
a rough idea
yeah so
in general this is a very kind of this
is the
very
uh
credible source for us to expand in
china because they have all the res all
the resources all the connections so
basically this is very
very important for growing in china
yeah i see that alexander a lot of wants
to add something alexander
yes thank you guys very much for the
presentation i um
the question i have is that very much
like the plan the current plan that you
presented
what are the resources that we currently
have in china i understand of course
that we have lease team which is a few
developers right what else could you
elaborate a little bit on the resources
that we have in china now in terms of
community developers
yeah
um
well if we if we divide the community
into two groups uh developers and kind
of crypto users and just in general
community
uh which works on promotion on
engagement etcetera
we have
well i know that this word is kind of uh
became abusive word uh in everscale but
we have chinese subgardens
uh which has uh eight people and uh
basically
uh
four of them
are focused on promotion and community
engagement
so uh
currently we plan to
uh do the promotion uh
uh
well basically using uh
using our resources that we have so
these people who have experience in
so they are all chinese they have
experience in blockchain projects in
china they helped us so far
uh since the very beginning
we are also actively looking and
currently interviewing
uh several uh candidates for um our
marketing uh team as well
to help us with a promotion on twitter
ama etc
uh to help with qls so
yeah basically we will increase the team
um
and
yes so this is kind of the core
the core that we have in general we have
um
community in telegram which currently
has
a thousand two hundred people
uh none of them are active unfortunately
but
yes still we kind of have this is the
starting point uh in wechat we have
around
around a half thousand
uh users as well
and developers so we have community of
uh 75 developers in uh wechat
also not not all of them are active but
still kind of i would say that uh 20 20
percent are
20 of them so we can work with them we
can communicate with them we can invite
them to the events and this is something
that we can work with but of course as i
mentioned before um
the main challenge for us in to increase
the community and to revive it to make
it more vibrant and active because
currently the main challenge and we want
to be kind of 100 percent honest with
you that uh the retention is very low
and the the community is not the type of
so
yes that's something that we're working
on
okay
roma any any other questions yeah yeah i
think that was uh full answer
uh
i have no question no more uh
just from my side i just want to wish
you guys good luck and i hope that
everything that you
you have described in your plan uh will
be realized as soon as possible because
communities uh where is quite believe uh
in the chinese market
and we need uh more representatives of
uh
here yeah
yeah we will be working on this and
yeah basically currently now the the
main challenge is to get as more users
as possible so yeah we
we've done preparative work but
currently
we will start with promotion and scaling
so yeah thank you thank you so much
thank you
can i ask
you
uh yeah but well yeah you can
think of your presentation it
was uh
very
full about uh full new information for
me a lot of new information for me and i
have one question did you try to
promote
this project in another chinese social
network like webo or qq or only in
wechat
um
yeah well thank you so much for the
question um
basically
so current situation in chinese the
following that even wechat is not very
appropriate source for promoting some
crypto related stuff
and um
basically we
are currently dividing our
social networks on
developer focused and crypto focused
crypto focused is twitter and telegram
and maybe discord but discord mainly for
developers uh wechat is mainly for
developers so because we cannot
bring up any crypto related stuff there
vapor and
qq is something that we
we had uh qq and vapor accounts and we
did some stuff there we
uh
posted a few articles etc but in general
it's not the main sources usually
uh for crypto blockchain uh
project so if you consider for example
near as a benchmark because near the
global
uh public chain which is which has very
decent attraction in china they do not
have vapor or they do not develop it
very
very very much
so that is why just
to focus
we prefer to focus on several
the most effective sources the most
effective channels in china which is um
which is uh
wechat for uh for developers yes
actually here we which are discord for
developers and twitter
and uh telegram for uh crypto users
is that full answer
i think so
great great alexander
alexander
yes i have another question um as you
guys saw jsnft got together with grand
bazaar got got essentially funding for
the full-fledged launch of jsonft.com uh
together with international chess
federation and hopefully it will be
quite large and massive
how long would the integration with the
china gcc standard nft standard take
uh to enable china also to join in
properly around chestnut.com
it's maybe a question to leave he's
still with us
what's the best estimate on the
integration uh at the moment i think i
think the guys from our acts they're
helping us and he did offer a lot of
help at the moment so we're still
reading through all the the standard
requirements from uh from the ddc from
the bsn because the the
the standard is actually strictly from
ethereum so those
which similar serum those blockchains
which have the similar
background of ethereum they're very easy
to to integrate but not for us
so we're still doing the the other
seminars and question answers with yes
in a moment so it's i think we're
looking forward to
to have the integration
ready
in one month i think yeah a month
would be uh would be the estimation
yeah
perfectly thank you very much that's
good timing
yeah nice
yeah and about uh chestnut um for china
so basically yes this is also something
that we can bring to the chinese users
as well but in general this is kind of a
hypothesis so we
need to test it and uh see how
uh
whether it will be popular among chinese
users because as you as you know
chinese users well usually
chinese
have their own chess
and they
pretty much different from the original
chess
and um
yeah so basically perhaps uh there could
be kind of some
other
uh reasons to
well not to be uh well for this topic
not to be so hot in china but we will
test it anyway i think that's a good
thing
okay
any other questions guys uh because well
i
i've actually heard that there are there
were a lot of questions during the
voting so a lot of guys kind of were
pretty skeptical about the chinese
community so
perhaps if
you have any questions
i think that uh they were a little bit
misleading because of chinese subgardens
and now it's not sub governance as as i
told you
uh yeah
yeah uh i would say that we need to
rename ourselves to i don't know to to
which uh other kind of we can we can
call ourselves the chinese dao
which is kind of very uh very
appropriate for the chinese uh community
um
or i don't know chinese embassy
anything
chinese representatives so we need to
think how to rename ourselves but in
general yeah
would be happy to keep working
yeah yeah there's a great work guys
[Music]
i just want to wish you good luck and
keep doing great great job yeah
thank you thank you roman thank you alex
thank you everybody for joining us
we'll keep working
yeah so there's no more questions just
want to say everyone uh good luck and
goodbye and if there is any help we are
here
