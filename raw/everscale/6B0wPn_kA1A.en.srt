game We released a new series of

1109
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:46,320
game We released a new series of
 

1110
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,310
game We released a new series of
interactive series we inserted it

1111
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:49,320
interactive series we inserted it
 

1112
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,649
interactive series we inserted it
inside the game and the players discovered it

1113
00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:51,659
inside the game and the players discovered it
 

1114
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:53,210

having to download anything
 

1118
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,470

and I think that

1119
00:27:59,470 --> 00:27:59,480
and I think that
 

1120
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,930
and I think that
in the future We can switch to

very fine, but in our game it
 

2037
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:11,230
very fine, but in our game it
will be  it doesn’t look very good, so

2038

here is another question about the
 

2049
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,990
here is another question about the
volume of digitization, that is, how much volume have you

2050
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:30,000
volume of digitization, that is, how much volume have you
 

2051
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,450
volume of digitization, that is, how much volume have you
already digitized, because Judging by the

already digitized, because Judging by the
 

2053
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,490
already digitized, because Judging by the

the question of how many sets we have already digitized
 

2117
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:52,609

is actually quite difficult
 

2119
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:55,630
is actually quite difficult
because there are already a lot of

because there are already a lot of
 

2121
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:59,510
because there are already a lot of
all kinds of ball masks and other things And now we

2122
00:55:59,510 --> 00:55:59,520
all kinds of ball masks and other things And now we
 

2123
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,910
all kinds of ball masks and other things And now we
have already digitized a gigantic territory of

2124

have already digitized a gigantic territory of
 

2125
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,569
have already digitized a gigantic territory of
several hectares and

several hectares and
 

2127
00:56:04,579 --> 00:56:08,150
several hectares and
right now we have already carried out a rough scanner

01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:18,069
now a huge plan, therefore to create a
master class we are creating a master class and

2504
01:06:18,069 --> 01:06:18,079
master class we are creating a master class and
 

2505
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,289
master class we are creating a master class and
standards of what can be placed in

2506
01:06:21,289 --> 01:06:21,299
standards of what can be placed in
 

2507
01:06:21,299 --> 01:06:23,770
standards of what can be placed in
order to find a place  in a

2508
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:23,780
order to find a place  in a
 

2509
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:27,529
order to find a place  in a
virtual ball,

2510
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:27,539
virtual ball,
 

2511
01:06:27,539 --> 01:06:29,450
virtual ball,
this will be obvious, we will present it through

2512
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:29,460
this will be obvious, we will present it through
 

2513
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:32,890
this will be obvious, we will present it through
training materials through examples

2514
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:32,900
training materials through examples
 

2515
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:36,410
training materials through examples
through support,

2516
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:36,420
through support,
 

2517
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:39,710
through support,
we called it a master plan and the

2518
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:39,720
we called it a master plan and the
 

2519
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:42,829
we called it a master plan and the
design code will not be included and we will have to

2520
01:06:42,829 --> 01:06:42,839
design code will not be included and we will have to
 

2521
01:06:42,839 --> 01:06:44,630
design code will not be included and we will have to
follow in order to create an environment such

2522
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:44,640
follow in order to create an environment such
 

2523
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,510
follow in order to create an environment such
as we are laying it down, so we will

2524
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:47,520
as we are laying it down, so we will
 

2525
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,569
as we are laying it down, so we will
share this

2526
01:06:49,569 --> 01:06:49,579
share this
 

2527
01:06:49,579 --> 01:06:53,829
share this
I personally want a resident I want to build a

2528
01:06:53,829 --> 01:06:53,839
I personally want a resident I want to build a
 

2529
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:57,650
I personally want a resident I want to build a
resort on Batura Because if we

2530
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:57,660
resort on Batura Because if we
 

2531
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:02,890
resort on Batura Because if we
do this it will be possible

2532
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:02,900

 

2533
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:09,309

Because if we build a ski resort there

2534
01:07:09,309 --> 01:07:09,319

 

2535
01:07:09,319 --> 01:07:12,410

will be a place where absolutely everything is

2536
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:12,420
will be a place where absolutely everything is
 

2537
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:17,170
will be a place where absolutely everything is
here The only thing that is missing is a ski resort,

2538
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:17,180

 

2539
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:20,390

you can build a spaceport It’s not a

2540
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:20,400
you can build a spaceport It’s not a
 

2541
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,430
you can build a spaceport It’s not a
problem, just buy yourself some

2542
01:07:22,430 --> 01:07:22,440
problem, just buy yourself some
 

2543
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:26,630
problem, just buy yourself some

anything can’t be built just like that,

2552
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:37,980
anything can’t be built just like that,
 

2553
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:40,130
anything can’t be built just like that,
it will be necessary to use

2554
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:40,140
it will be necessary to use
 

2555
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:44,630
it will be necessary to use
our guides. And then everything is realizable.
