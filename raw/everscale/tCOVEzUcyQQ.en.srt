which is a ethereum breach stage two so
 

83
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,990
which is a ethereum breach stage two so
uh just to remind so the second stage is

84
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
uh just to remind so the second stage is
 

85
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,389
uh just to remind so the second stage is
named

86
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
named
 

87
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,789

blockchains

90
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
blockchains
 

91
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,310
blockchains
and in fact it is a chained contest

92
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
and in fact it is a chained contest
 

93
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,910
and in fact it is a chained contest
meaning that only the

94
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
meaning that only the
 

95
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,270
meaning that only the
teams who has won any price place on the

96
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
teams who has won any price place on the
 

97
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,149
teams who has won any price place on the
first stage for

98
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
first stage for
 

99
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,630
first stage for
the implementation is eligible to

100
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
the implementation is eligible to
 

101
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,949
the implementation is eligible to
participate in the second stage so

102
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
participate in the second stage so
 

103
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,270
participate in the second stage so
actually this means that only brock's

104
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
actually this means that only brock's
 

105
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,229
actually this means that only brock's
team is

106
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
team is
 

107
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,309
team is

so i think it's fine if we
 

111
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,990
so i think it's fine if we
make it with a short short term like one

112
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
make it with a short short term like one
 

113
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,710
make it with a short short term like one
month

month
 

115
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,750
month
i guess just to let us finalize all

116

the things and make it
polish it a bit as we

120
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
polish it a bit as we
 

121
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,589
polish it a bit as we
have shown during the demo last time

00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
uh the most criticism we've got is
 

139
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,070
uh the most criticism we've got is
uh that we still have some admin keys

140
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,080
uh that we still have some admin keys
 

141
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,830
uh that we still have some admin keys

uh we have slightly touches during the

146
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
uh we have slightly touches during the
 

147
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,229
uh we have slightly touches during the
demo but

151
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,869
um let me maybe uh clarify this a bit uh
deeper so to implement

152
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
deeper so to implement
 

153
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,430
deeper so to implement
governance model it will take three

154
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
governance model it will take three
 

155
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,110
governance model it will take three
something like three months

156
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
something like three months
 

157
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,390
something like three months
of of work of the team and

158
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
of of work of the team and
 

159
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,949
of of work of the team and
because it's not not that the easy the

160
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
because it's not not that the easy the
 

161
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,390
because it's not not that the easy the

162
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
easy task
 

163
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,710
easy task
and that's why currently we have of

164
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
and that's why currently we have of
 

165
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,750
and that's why currently we have of
course some

166
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
course some
 

167
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,270
course some
simpler architecture and it will go

168
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
simpler architecture and it will go
 

169
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,710
simpler architecture and it will go
it will go definitely and

170
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
it will go definitely and
 

171
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,350
it will go definitely and
after the governance model is ready it

172
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
after the governance model is ready it
 

173

merged

266
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
merged
 

267
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,950
merged
on the as part of the of this

268
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
on the as part of the of this
 

269
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,150
on the as part of the of this
of this proposal there would there was

270
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
of this proposal there would there was
 

271
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,310
of this proposal there would there was
the idea that there would be a contest

272
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
the idea that there would be a contest
 

273
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,469
the idea that there would be a contest
to develop a swapper

274
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
to develop a swapper
 

275
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,909
to develop a swapper
so that every dune token

276
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
so that every dune token
 

277
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,469
so that every dune token
would be converted to friton

278
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
would be converted to friton
 

279
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,070
would be converted to friton
crystal token so it's not really a swap

280
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
crystal token so it's not really a swap
 

281
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,150
crystal token so it's not really a swap
in the same sense as the bridge between

282
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
in the same sense as the bridge between
 

283
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,350
in the same sense as the bridge between
uh

284
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
uh
 

285
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,909
uh
ethereum and friton it's not about

286
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
ethereum and friton it's not about
 

287
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:46,629
ethereum and friton it's not about
having

288
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639
having
 

289
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,670
having
june tokens on return but to convert

290
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
june tokens on return but to convert
 

291
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,390
june tokens on return but to convert
them

292
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
them
 

293
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,870
them
as a to dune to freeton tokens

294
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
as a to dune to freeton tokens
 

295
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,390
as a to dune to freeton tokens
so the the idea is to onboard

296
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
so the the idea is to onboard
 

297
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,469
so the the idea is to onboard
the dune community inside the freetown

298
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
the dune community inside the freetown
 

299
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,469
the dune community inside the freetown
community so of course

300
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
community so of course
 

301
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,029
community so of course
that has started already there are some

302
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
that has started already there are some
 

303
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,230
that has started already there are some
members that are already part of a few

304
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:07,240
members that are already part of a few
 

305
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,110
members that are already part of a few
sub-governances and they are also

306
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120
sub-governances and they are also
 

307
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,990
sub-governances and they are also
involved in the in contests but to be

308
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
involved in the in contests but to be
 

309
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,830
involved in the in contests but to be
completely included

310
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
completely included
 

311
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,629
completely included
the the merger has to happen so i think

312
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
the the merger has to happen so i think
 

313
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,510
the the merger has to happen so i think
that now we

314
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
that now we
 

315
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,230
that now we
will really have to to to do that as

316
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,240
will really have to to to do that as
 

317
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,670
will really have to to to do that as
fast as possible

318
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
fast as possible
 

319
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,230
fast as possible
so what i did is i took a copy of the

320
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
so what i did is i took a copy of the
 

321
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,070
so what i did is i took a copy of the
ethereum bitcoin

322
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
ethereum bitcoin
 

323
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,350
ethereum bitcoin
bridge contest and i modified it

324
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
bridge contest and i modified it
 

325
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,029
bridge contest and i modified it
to to fit for a swap with juno

326
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,039
to to fit for a swap with juno
 

327
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,550
to to fit for a swap with juno
and so i submitted it on the forum also

328
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
and so i submitted it on the forum also
 

329
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,629
and so i submitted it on the forum also
and so the first questions i got was

330
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
and so the first questions i got was
 

331
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,629
and so the first questions i got was
about the bridge with tezos so

332
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:42,639
about the bridge with tezos so
 

333
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,070
about the bridge with tezos so
so june is a fork of tesos

334
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
so june is a fork of tesos
 

335
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,029
so june is a fork of tesos

the language
 

343
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,550

00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
for for dune is a
 

345
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,950
for for dune is a
much more powerful than the one of tezos

346
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
much more powerful than the one of tezos
 

347
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,350
much more powerful than the one of tezos
so it's easier to write contracts

348
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
so it's easier to write contracts
 

349
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,629
so it's easier to write contracts
on june that than it is on tesos so i

350
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
on june that than it is on tesos so i
 

351
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,150
on june that than it is on tesos so i
think that

352
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
think that
 

353
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,189
think that
we shouldn't try to

354
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
we shouldn't try to
 

355
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,870
we shouldn't try to
to create immediately a bridge with

356
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:10,880
to create immediately a bridge with
 

357
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,870
to create immediately a bridge with
tezos in this contest

358
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
tezos in this contest
 

359
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,350
tezos in this contest
because it's i cannot estimate the time

360
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
because it's i cannot estimate the time
 

361
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,550
because it's i cannot estimate the time
it would take

362
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
it would take
 

363
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,309
it would take
and i can estimate the time it would

364
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
and i can estimate the time it would
 

365
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,589
and i can estimate the time it would
take for you know

366
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,599
take for you know
 

367
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,629
take for you know
which is a few weeks or something like

368
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
which is a few weeks or something like
 

369
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,510
which is a few weeks or something like
that

370
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
that
 

371
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,629
that
and and so i would prefer so it's my

372
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
and and so i would prefer so it's my
 

373
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,070
and and so i would prefer so it's my
opinion of course

374
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
opinion of course
 

375
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,469
opinion of course
to have two separated and the other

376
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
to have two separated and the other
 

377
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,589
to have two separated and the other
reason is that

378
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
reason is that
 

379
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,830
reason is that
to my knowledge there is not so much

380
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
to my knowledge there is not so much
 

381
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,790
to my knowledge there is not so much
defy

382
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
defy
 

383
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,430
defy
on tezos at this point they actually had

384
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
on tezos at this point they actually had
 

385
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:37,909
on tezos at this point they actually had
a bug

386
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
a bug
 

387
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,790
a bug
in the token wallet recently and they

388
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
in the token wallet recently and they
 

389
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,270
in the token wallet recently and they
had to

390
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
had to
 

391
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,309
had to
to to to clean it so

392
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,319
to to to clean it so
 

393
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,350
to to to clean it so
so i think it's not that urgent

394
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
so i think it's not that urgent
 

395
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,230
so i think it's not that urgent
to to have a blade with tezos so i think

396
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
to to have a blade with tezos so i think
 

397
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,390
to to have a blade with tezos so i think
the two contests could be separated and

398
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
the two contests could be separated and
 

399
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,629
the two contests could be separated and
the bridge with tasers can be done later

400
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:54,639
the bridge with tasers can be done later
 

401
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,189
the bridge with tasers can be done later
and especially as the people from june

402
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,199
and especially as the people from june
 

403
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,430
and especially as the people from june
have a better knowledge of this or they

404
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440
have a better knowledge of this or they
 

405
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,869
have a better knowledge of this or they
will be able to also

406
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
will be able to also
 

407
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,749
will be able to also
compete in that contest so so i think it

408
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
compete in that contest so so i think it
 

409
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,029
compete in that contest so so i think it
makes sense to have the two separated

410
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
makes sense to have the two separated
 

411
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,270
makes sense to have the two separated
so that's for the introduction i don't

412
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
so that's for the introduction i don't
 

413
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,309
so that's for the introduction i don't
know if well

414
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
know if well
 

415
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,230
know if well
of course if you have questions i am

416
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
of course if you have questions i am
 

417
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,390
of course if you have questions i am
here today so i welcome any

418
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
here today so i welcome any
 

419
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,189
here today so i welcome any
questions and feedback on on the ideas

420
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199
questions and feedback on on the ideas
 

421
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:17,670
questions and feedback on on the ideas
to

422
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:17,680
to
 

423
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,710
to
see how to to go forward now yeah thank

424
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
see how to to go forward now yeah thank
 

425
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,749
see how to to go forward now yeah thank
you so much

426
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:21,759
you so much
 

427
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,029
you so much
actually i have looked through a

428
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
actually i have looked through a
 

429
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,790
actually i have looked through a
proposal and i have few

430
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
proposal and i have few
 

431
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,909
proposal and i have few
few comments so um the first one

432
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
few comments so um the first one
 

433
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,270
few comments so um the first one
is uh normally we have

434
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
is uh normally we have
 

435
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,829
is uh normally we have
the contest split in several stages so

436
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
the contest split in several stages so
 

437
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,110
the contest split in several stages so
the first one is the design and

438
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,120
the first one is the design and
 

439
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,389
the first one is the design and
architecture stage

440
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
architecture stage
 

441
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,589
architecture stage
where we just collect

442
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
where we just collect
 

443
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,310
where we just collect
best architecture to implement this so

444
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
best architecture to implement this so
 

445
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,149
best architecture to implement this so
and

446
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
and
 

447
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,269
and
saying that this

448
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
saying that this
 

449
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,710
saying that this
kind of tool will not be that

450
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
kind of tool will not be that
 

451
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,030
kind of tool will not be that
that complex as a bridge one for example

452
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
that complex as a bridge one for example
 

453
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,990
that complex as a bridge one for example
as a fully functioning

454
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
as a fully functioning
 

455
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,350
as a fully functioning
bridge uh i think that the period

456
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
bridge uh i think that the period
 

457
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,070
bridge uh i think that the period
to implement this can can be really

458
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
to implement this can can be really
 

459
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,110
to implement this can can be really
shorter

460
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,120
shorter
 

461
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,710
shorter
and uh and i don't really know if we

462
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
and uh and i don't really know if we
 

463
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,350
and uh and i don't really know if we
need this

464
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
need this
 

465
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,630
need this
stage now uh taking that

466
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
stage now uh taking that
 

467
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,829
stage now uh taking that
according to the proposal that was taken

468
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
according to the proposal that was taken
 

469
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:12,550
according to the proposal that was taken
by the

470
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
by the
 

471
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,750
by the
main governance so the merger should

472
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
main governance so the merger should
 

473
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,790
main governance so the merger should
just end in under three months

474
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:18,800
just end in under three months
 

475
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,870
just end in under three months
so i don't know from which moment in

476
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
so i don't know from which moment in
 

477
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,790
so i don't know from which moment in
time the counter has started

478
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:22,800
time the counter has started
 

479
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,150
time the counter has started
uh so i cannot judge it

480
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
uh so i cannot judge it
 

481
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,949
uh so i cannot judge it
by myself if it's feasible or not so

482
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
by myself if it's feasible or not so
 

483
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:29,829
by myself if it's feasible or not so
maybe media

484
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
maybe media
 

485
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,430
maybe media
who's here uh can just give a comment on

486
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
who's here uh can just give a comment on
 

487
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,750
who's here uh can just give a comment on
this

488
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:33,760
this
 

489
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,949
this
so uh what do you think um

490
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
so uh what do you think um
 

491
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,829
so uh what do you think um
should we have some uh architecture

492
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:39,839
should we have some uh architecture
 

493
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,949
should we have some uh architecture
stage

494
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
stage
 

495
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,590
stage
at least even shorter one uh before we

496
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
at least even shorter one uh before we
 

497
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,070
at least even shorter one uh before we
run the

498
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
run the
 

499
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,430
run the
implementation i always prefer

500
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
implementation i always prefer
 

501
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,269
implementation i always prefer
architecture stage you know

502
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
architecture stage you know
 

503
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,470
architecture stage you know
yes yes so maybe what what we will do so

504
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480
yes yes so maybe what what we will do so
 

505
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:50,949
yes yes so maybe what what we will do so
we

506
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
we
 

507
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,670
we
will uh run the architecture stage two

508
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
will uh run the architecture stage two
 

509
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,790
will uh run the architecture stage two
two weeks contest

510
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
two weeks contest
 

511
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,670
two weeks contest
just to collect some information because

512
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
just to collect some information because
 

513
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,630
just to collect some information because
uh

514
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
uh

520
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
smart contracts here for now i hope that
 

521
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,150
smart contracts here for now i hope that
the number will grow significantly after

522
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
the number will grow significantly after
 

523
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,190
the number will grow significantly after
the merger and uh

524
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,200

june development teams

532
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
june development teams
 

533
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,630
june development teams
who will be participating in this

534
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
who will be participating in this
 

535
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,310
who will be participating in this
contest and they will be writing the

536
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
contest and they will be writing the
 

537
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,430
contest and they will be writing the
implementation

538
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
implementation
 

539
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,069
implementation
so that they could come and participate

540
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
so that they could come and participate
 

541
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,990
so that they could come and participate
and the more participants is better

542
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
and the more participants is better
 

543
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,509
and the more participants is better
so uh actually uh and then we will uh

544
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
so uh actually uh and then we will uh
 

545
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,030
so uh actually uh and then we will uh
launch one month in the implementation

546
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
launch one month in the implementation
 

547
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,870
launch one month in the implementation
stage i think one month is more than

548
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
stage i think one month is more than
 

549
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,430
stage i think one month is more than
enough

550
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
enough
 

551
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,030
enough
for for this uh purpose uh and this

552
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
for for this uh purpose uh and this
 

553
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,069
for for this uh purpose uh and this
this way i think we will cope within the

554
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:44,079
this way i think we will cope within the
 

555
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,790
this way i think we will cope within the
time frame that was announced from the

556
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
time frame that was announced from the
 

557
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,430
time frame that was announced from the
main governance

558
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
main governance
 

559
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,949
main governance
the next uh point i will address

560
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
the next uh point i will address
 

561
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,030
the next uh point i will address
is uh that normally before launching the

562
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
is uh that normally before launching the

how it will be run uh what you need to
do to participate

574
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
do to participate
 

575
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,870
do to participate
just to ensure that at least several

june
 

583
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,630
june
developers so i am not sure to

584
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
developers so i am not sure to
 

585
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,269
developers so i am not sure to
understand

586
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:19,279
understand
 

587
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,750

who i should contact so clearly uh there
 

589
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,949
who i should contact so clearly uh there
is a team of

590
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
is a team of
 

591
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,630
is a team of
origin labs that will be competing

592
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:26,640
origin labs that will be competing
 

593
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:34,069
origin labs that will be competing
the other teams uh well i don't know

594

595
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,430

i don't think that well they have to

596
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
i don't think that well they have to
 

597
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,069
i don't think that well they have to
come from

598
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
come from
 

599
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,910

so we will need to select i guess one

624
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:11,440
so we will need to select i guess one
 

625
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,470
so we will need to select i guess one
uh winning solution that will be used to

626
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
uh winning solution that will be used to
 

627
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,470
uh winning solution that will be used to
perform the transfer of tokens to the

628
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
perform the transfer of tokens to the
 

629
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,990
perform the transfer of tokens to the
swap of tokens

630
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
swap of tokens
 

631
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,750
swap of tokens
uh and it should be also dually governed

632
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
uh and it should be also dually governed
 

633
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,910
uh and it should be also dually governed
so uh i sorry i didn't get the last um

634
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920
so uh i sorry i didn't get the last um
 

635
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,269
so uh i sorry i didn't get the last um
government i mean that uh this is

636
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
government i mean that uh this is
 

637
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,430
government i mean that uh this is
the point where the huge amount of money

638
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440
the point where the huge amount of money
 

639
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,470
the point where the huge amount of money
will be transferred

640
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
will be transferred
 

641
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,829
will be transferred
yeah and it should be uh con i think

642
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
yeah and it should be uh con i think
 

643
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,110
yeah and it should be uh con i think
done under the control of some people or

644
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
done under the control of some people or
 

645
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,629
done under the control of some people or
some reputable people

646
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
some reputable people
 

647
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,509
some reputable people
from both sides and this also should be

648
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
from both sides and this also should be
 

649
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,870
from both sides and this also should be
tackled within the architecture stage

650
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
tackled within the architecture stage
 

651
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,870
tackled within the architecture stage
so how it will be done because this is

652
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
so how it will be done because this is
 

653
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,629
so how it will be done because this is
not clear for me

654
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
not clear for me
 

655
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,310
not clear for me
from from the proposal and

656
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
from from the proposal and
 

657
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,750
from from the proposal and
last but not least we have

658
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:57,760
last but not least we have
 

659
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,269
last but not least we have
done a lot of improvements in our

660
00:12:59,269 --> 00:12:59,279
done a lot of improvements in our
 

661
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,110
done a lot of improvements in our
procedural parts in the device of

662
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,120
procedural parts in the device of
 

663
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,790
procedural parts in the device of
governance and

664
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:02,800
governance and
 

665
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,990
governance and
i will share with you an example of

666
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
i will share with you an example of
 

667
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,269
i will share with you an example of
recent contests uh how we do this so

668
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279
recent contests uh how we do this so
 

669
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,269
recent contests uh how we do this so
just briefly speaking it will mean we

670
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,279
just briefly speaking it will mean we
 

671
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,110
just briefly speaking it will mean we
will just need to get rid of half of

672
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
will just need to get rid of half of
 

673
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,790
will just need to get rid of half of
text from the proposal and just put the

674
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:14,800
text from the proposal and just put the
 

675
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,550
text from the proposal and just put the
reference to the

676
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560
reference to the
 

677
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,750
reference to the

00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:22,560
summarizes all of these main blocks and
 

681
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,430
summarizes all of these main blocks and
that's it

682

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,389
uh in all the rest yeah it's it's a nice
proposal and

686
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399
proposal and
 

687
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,430
proposal and
if we just tackle these three points so

688
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
if we just tackle these three points so
 

689
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,389
if we just tackle these three points so
it's fine

690
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:32,399
it's fine
 

691
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,030
it's fine
one more thing is that uh asset will be

692
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040
one more thing is that uh asset will be
 

693
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,069
one more thing is that uh asset will be
funded from

694
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
funded from
 

695
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,110
funded from
the main governance uh so we will just

696
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
the main governance uh so we will just
 

697
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,590
the main governance uh so we will just
need to

698
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:39,600
need to
 

699
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,189
need to
to write this specifically uh inside

700
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:43,199
to write this specifically uh inside
 

701
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,550
to write this specifically uh inside
so and maybe we will uh formally run

702
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
so and maybe we will uh formally run
 

703
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:46,949
so and maybe we will uh formally run
this

704
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959
this
 

705
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,750
this
under the main governance interface but

706
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
under the main governance interface but
 

707
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,790
under the main governance interface but
the

708
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
the
 

709
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,829
the
jurors groups will be from defy and from

710
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
jurors groups will be from defy and from
 

711
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,350
jurors groups will be from defy and from
devex

712
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
devex
 

713
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,430
devex
so yeah so uh i will do my best

714
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,440
so yeah so uh i will do my best
 

715
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,110
so yeah so uh i will do my best
to just update your proposal uh

716
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
to just update your proposal uh
 

717
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,750
to just update your proposal uh
this week hopefully tomorrow and just

718
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:05,760
this week hopefully tomorrow and just
 

719
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,230
this week hopefully tomorrow and just
will

720
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,240
will
 

721
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,110
will
drop the updated version uh in the group

722
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
drop the updated version uh in the group
 

723
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,389
drop the updated version uh in the group
so to make everything

724
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399
so to make everything
 

725
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,990
so to make everything
so what i understand is that there will

726
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
so what i understand is that there will
 

727
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,310
so what i understand is that there will
be a first contest of two weeks

728
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,320
be a first contest of two weeks
 

729
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,790
be a first contest of two weeks
yeah so starting next week in some way

730
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:16,800
yeah so starting next week in some way
 

731
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,910
yeah so starting next week in some way
uh

732
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
uh
 

733
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,910
uh
for the architecture and then the the

734
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
for the architecture and then the the
 

735
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,069
for the architecture and then the the
next contest will be the implementation

736
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,079
next contest will be the implementation
 

737
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:22,949
next contest will be the implementation
itself yeah

738
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:22,959
itself yeah
 

739
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,629
itself yeah
exactly as a result of the

740
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:24,639
exactly as a result of the
 

741
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,550
exactly as a result of the
implementation can we

742
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560
implementation can we
 

743
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,949
implementation can we
do you think we can get something that

744
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:28,959
do you think we can get something that
 

745
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:29,990
do you think we can get something that
every team will

746
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
every team will
 

747
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,150
every team will
in some way deploy the solution on the

748
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,160
in some way deploy the solution on the
 

749
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,069
in some way deploy the solution on the
network sometimes i don't know so we'll

750
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:34,079
network sometimes i don't know so we'll
 

751
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,310
network sometimes i don't know so we'll
choose between them now yeah we will see

752
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
choose between them now yeah we will see
 

753
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,110
choose between them now yeah we will see
this

754
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
this
 

755
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,590
this
should be the uh outcome of the design

756
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600
should be the uh outcome of the design
 

757
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,310
should be the uh outcome of the design
stage

758
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
stage
 

759
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,870
stage
so on how this should be done and this

760
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:42,880
so on how this should be done and this
 

761
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,990
so on how this should be done and this
is why this stage

762
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
is why this stage
 

763
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,590
is why this stage
is also crucial because uh it helps you

764
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,600
is also crucial because uh it helps you
 

765
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,069
is also crucial because uh it helps you
to prevent a lot of mistakes in the

766
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:50,079
to prevent a lot of mistakes in the
 

767
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,430
to prevent a lot of mistakes in the
implementation stage

768
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
implementation stage
 

769
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,069
implementation stage
so you you will have several teams

770
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:54,079
so you you will have several teams
 

771
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,189
so you you will have several teams
competing uh

772
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:55,199
competing uh
 

773
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,350
competing uh
with the proposed architectures that

774
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
with the proposed architectures that
 

775
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,870
with the proposed architectures that
will be tackling these

776
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:58,880
will be tackling these
 

777
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,230
will be tackling these
governance issues it will be tackling

778
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,240
governance issues it will be tackling
 

779
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,949
governance issues it will be tackling
this

780
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
this
 

781
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,710
this
issue of how to this

782
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
issue of how to this
 

783
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,629
issue of how to this
source code should be used whether it

784
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:08,639
source code should be used whether it
 

785
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,710
source code should be used whether it
will be just one interface or

786
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:10,720
will be just one interface or
 

787
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,150
will be just one interface or
multiple interfaces or whatever so

788
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
multiple interfaces or whatever so
 

789
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,790
multiple interfaces or whatever so
i don't have the answer now but uh

790
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
i don't have the answer now but uh
 

791
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,629
i don't have the answer now but uh
that's why we run design stage

792
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:18,639
that's why we run design stage
 

793
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,230
that's why we run design stage
first actually yeah so uh

794
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,240
first actually yeah so uh
 

795
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,110
first actually yeah so uh
and at the end so we will definitely

796
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120
and at the end so we will definitely
 

797
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,189
and at the end so we will definitely
achieve our objective

798
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
achieve our objective
 

799
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,870
achieve our objective
okay guys do you have any questions of a

800
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880
okay guys do you have any questions of a
 

801
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,470
okay guys do you have any questions of a
breeze please

802
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480

 

803
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,910

yes i have questions about dune network

804
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
yes i have questions about dune network
 

805
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,110
yes i have questions about dune network
and maybe about developers team indian

806
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
and maybe about developers team indian
 

807
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,829
and maybe about developers team indian
network

808
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
network
 

809
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,350
network
how many team you have and

810
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,360
how many team you have and
 

811
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,030
how many team you have and
what we should do if you want to

812
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,040
what we should do if you want to
 

813
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,949
what we should do if you want to
move with teams to frito network

814
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:52,959
move with teams to frito network
 

815
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,509
move with teams to frito network
because we need a lot of developers and

816
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
because we need a lot of developers and
 

817
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,230
because we need a lot of developers and
a lot of

818
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,240
a lot of
 

819
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,550
a lot of
we want to create a lot of projects in

820
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
we want to create a lot of projects in
 

821
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,069
we want to create a lot of projects in
our system

822
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:00,079
our system
 

823
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,350
our system
so uh so there is the main team which is

824
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
so uh so there is the main team which is
 

825
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,670
so uh so there is the main team which is
the origin labs

826
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
the origin labs
 

827
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,189
the origin labs
who i am part of

828
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:09,199
who i am part of
 

829
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,310
who i am part of
and i think that for the other teams

830
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:12,320
and i think that for the other teams
 

831
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,749
and i think that for the other teams
i know at least two other projects

832
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
i know at least two other projects
 

833
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,470
i know at least two other projects
that are on you know that are being

834
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
that are on you know that are being
 

835
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,069
that are on you know that are being
developed

836
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079
developed
 

837
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,509
developed
one is actually already uh

838
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:23,519
one is actually already uh
 

839
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,629
one is actually already uh
i've already been retargeted to return

840
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:26,639
i've already been retargeted to return
 

841
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,949
i've already been retargeted to return
so i think that team i will contact them

842
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:28,959
so i think that team i will contact them
 

843
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,150
so i think that team i will contact them
because of course

844
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
because of course
 

845
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,509
because of course
they have both knowledges and for

846
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:33,519
they have both knowledges and for
 

847
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,310
they have both knowledges and for
for everyone i don't know exactly what

848
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,320
for everyone i don't know exactly what
 

849
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,110
for everyone i don't know exactly what
what they're doing right now

850
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:38,120
what they're doing right now
 

851
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,590
what they're doing right now

at this point so of course

854
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:42,800
at this point so of course
 

855
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,509
at this point so of course
june being a fork of tesos there is

856
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:45,519

well so we have a lot of
 

1237
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,230
well so we have a lot of
uh highly complex technical solutions

1238
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,240
uh highly complex technical solutions
 

1239
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,430
uh highly complex technical solutions
being developed within device

this is something that really needs to
be

00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:51,039
and our main target is to make it
 

1253
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,710
and our main target is to make it
as have

1254
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:54,720
as have
 

1255
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,310
as have
as slow number of bugs as possible

1256
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:58,320
as slow number of bugs as possible
 

1257
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,510
as slow number of bugs as possible
and as you remember normally in our

1258
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:01,520
and as you remember normally in our
 

1259
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,669
and as you remember normally in our
technical context there is a last stage

1260
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:03,679
technical context there is a last stage
 

1261
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,310
technical context there is a last stage
named

1262
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,320

security audit but before security audit

1264
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:08,159
security audit but before security audit
 

1265
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,470
security audit but before security audit
will be performed uh i think it is

1266
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:12,480
will be performed uh i think it is
 

1267
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,190
will be performed uh i think it is
will be a good idea to run a bug bounty

1268
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,200
will be a good idea to run a bug bounty
 

1269
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,310
will be a good idea to run a bug bounty
program on

1270
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,320
program on
 

1271
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,750
program on
any solutions that have been developed

1272
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:17,760
any solutions that have been developed
 

1273
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,990
any solutions that have been developed
within the device of governance

1274
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,000
within the device of governance
 

1275
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,149
within the device of governance
uh so uh i have for now no idea of

1276
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:24,159
uh so uh i have for now no idea of
 

1277
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,510
uh so uh i have for now no idea of
what the prices should be or

1278
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:27,520
what the prices should be or
 

1279
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,909
what the prices should be or
should it be recurring or maybe a fixed

1280
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:29,919
should it be recurring or maybe a fixed
 

1281
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,549
should it be recurring or maybe a fixed
contest

1282
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:30,559
contest
 

1283
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,269
contest
or should it last one week or one month

1284
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:33,279
or should it last one week or one month
 

1285
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,310
or should it last one week or one month
uh

1286

i just believe strongly believe that
it's something that we really need

i'm thinking
 

1305
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,669
i'm thinking
um is it possible to make a bug bounty

1306
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:07,679
um is it possible to make a bug bounty
 

1307
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,710
um is it possible to make a bug bounty
program

1308
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:08,720
program
 

1309
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,750
program
like repeating every

1310
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:11,760
like repeating every
 

1311
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,149
like repeating every
month or maybe every half of a year

1312
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:14,159
month or maybe every half of a year
 

1313
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,430
month or maybe every half of a year
because usually in

1314
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:15,440
because usually in
 

1315
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,549
because usually in
from a practice box appears

1316
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:18,559
from a practice box appears
 

1317
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,990
from a practice box appears
not from during the starting period of

1318
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,000
not from during the starting period of
 

1319
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,789
not from during the starting period of
using the software they are appearing

1320
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:26,799
using the software they are appearing
 

1321
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,590
using the software they are appearing
from some

1322
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:27,600
from some
 

1323
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,510
from some
time from time to time during whole

1324
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:31,520
time from time to time during whole
 

1325
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,310
time from time to time during whole
life cycle of the software so what do

1326
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,320
life cycle of the software so what do
 

1327
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,430
life cycle of the software so what do
you think about

1328
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:35,440
you think about
 

1329
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,590
you think about
creating bug bounty repeating

1330
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:39,600
creating bug bounty repeating
 

1331
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,789
creating bug bounty repeating
this program contests and

1332
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:42,799
this program contests and
 

1333
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,149
this program contests and
assign such rewards

1334
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:46,159
assign such rewards
 

1335
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,190
assign such rewards
that will make some

1336
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,200
that will make some
 

1337
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,990
that will make some
we're broken the software and uh

1338
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,000

 

1339
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,350

no economically effective

1340
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,360
no economically effective
 

1341
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,870
no economically effective
i mean if some guy will find a bug

1342
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:02,880
i mean if some guy will find a bug
 

1343
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,510
i mean if some guy will find a bug
for him it will be much easier faster

1344
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:05,520
for him it will be much easier faster
 

1345
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,430
for him it will be much easier faster
and economically reasonable

1346
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:07,440
and economically reasonable
 

1347
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,870
and economically reasonable
to report it instead of trying to

1348
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:10,880
to report it instead of trying to
 

1349
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,789
to report it instead of trying to
make something wrong with the software

1350
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:14,799
make something wrong with the software
 

1351
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,389
make something wrong with the software
this is my point

1352
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:18,399

 

1353
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,269

yes i agree that uh backbone is

1354
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:21,279
yes i agree that uh backbone is
 

1355
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:21,990
yes i agree that uh backbone is
something that's

1356
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,000
something that's
 

1357
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,669
something that's
normally run or repeated

1358
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:25,679
normally run or repeated
 

1359
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,510
normally run or repeated
in a repeated way and

1360
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:29,520

 

1361
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,750

there is of course should be the

1362
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:31,760
there is of course should be the
 

1363
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,029
there is of course should be the
different rewards

1364
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:33,039

we there were some bugs found and we
 

1701
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,990
we there were some bugs found and we
already have some bug found

1702
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,000
already have some bug found
 

1703
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,190
already have some bug found
during this contest as well so it

1704
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,200
during this contest as well so it
 

1705
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,869
during this contest as well so it
i don't know i had that just this

1706
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:46,879
i don't know i had that just this

there they report the bugs
 

1735
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,550
there they report the bugs
and we we kind of pay them after that

1736

the prize pool is divided
 

1763
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,550
the prize pool is divided
um i really don't know how to best

1764
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:48,560
um i really don't know how to best
 

1765
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,069
um i really don't know how to best
organize that

organize that
 

1767
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,750
organize that
it can be organized in very different

00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,200
ways we can run
 

1771
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,390
ways we can run
we can have a ongoing

00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:56,400
we can have a ongoing
 

1773
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,990
we can have a ongoing
bug contest as fabrice said

1774

bug contest as fabrice said
 

1775
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,790
bug contest as fabrice said
uh in parallel we can run special

1776
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:02,800
uh in parallel we can run special
 

1777
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,150
uh in parallel we can run special
contests for

1778
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:04,160
contests for
 

1779
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,550
contests for
particulars like bugs to find bugs in

1780
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:06,560
particulars like bugs to find bugs in
 

1781
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,430
particulars like bugs to find bugs in
particular

1782
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:07,440
particular
 

1783
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,470
particular
solutions you know i don't think it's

1784
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:10,480
solutions you know i don't think it's
 

1785
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,790
solutions you know i don't think it's
one conflicting another

1786
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:12,800
one conflicting another
 

1787
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,829
one conflicting another
and of course you need to just

1788
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:15,839
and of course you need to just
 

1789
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,710
and of course you need to just
account that you have four that you have

1790
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:18,720
account that you have four that you have
 

1791
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,430
account that you have four that you have
like

1792
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:19,440
like
 

1793
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,589
like
two in parallel or whatever so you

1794
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:21,599
two in parallel or whatever so you
 

1795
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,510
two in parallel or whatever so you
should say that the one bug cannot be

1796
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:23,520
should say that the one bug cannot be
 

1797
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,430
should say that the one bug cannot be
submitted into two or three more

1798
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:25,440
submitted into two or three more
 

1799
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,950
submitted into two or three more
so on but other than that i don't know

1800
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:28,960
so on but other than that i don't know
 

1801
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,069
so on but other than that i don't know
that's uh i think it's open kind of

1802
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:32,079
that's uh i think it's open kind of
 

1803
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,470
that's uh i think it's open kind of
everyone should decide what's better for

1804
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:34,480
everyone should decide what's better for
 

1805
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,510
everyone should decide what's better for
for particular i mean

1806
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:35,520
for particular i mean
 

1807
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,870
for particular i mean
because different software different

1808
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:36,880
because different software different
 

1809
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,670
because different software different
solutions have different

1810
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:39,680
solutions have different
 

1811
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,710
solutions have different
probably ways to approach like the bug

1812
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:42,720
probably ways to approach like the bug
 

1813
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,150
probably ways to approach like the bug
bounty program

1814
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:44,160
bounty program
 

1815
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,270
bounty program
i guess um that's why i don't think that

1816
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:47,280
i guess um that's why i don't think that
 

1817
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,310
i guess um that's why i don't think that
we just

1818
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:48,320
we just
 

1819
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,270
we just
can have one program that covers it all

1820
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:51,280
can have one program that covers it all
 

1821
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,710
can have one program that covers it all
for all the cases because there are

1822
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:52,720
for all the cases because there are
 

1823
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,349
for all the cases because there are
several

1824
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:53,359
several
 

1825
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,550
several
a few cases that are very kind of can be

1826
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:56,560
a few cases that are very kind of can be
 

1827
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,589
a few cases that are very kind of can be
very different

1828
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:57,599
very different
 

1829
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,510
very different
for example if you just run a bug bounty

1830
00:36:59,510 --> 00:36:59,520
for example if you just run a bug bounty
 

1831
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,589
for example if you just run a bug bounty
program for just general bugs and

1832
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:01,599
program for just general bugs and
 

1833
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,270
program for just general bugs and
in smart contracts and in software

in smart contracts and in software
 

1835
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,910
in smart contracts and in software
and then you have the uh the validators

1836
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:07,920
and then you have the uh the validators
 

1837
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,990
and then you have the uh the validators
contest

1838

it it it should you know

1840
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:13,839
it it it should you know
 

1841
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,990
it it it should you know
people will not report the bugs in the

1842
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,000
people will not report the bugs in the
 

1843
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,670
people will not report the bugs in the
general program because they won't

1844
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:17,680
general program because they won't
 

1845
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,069
general program because they won't
think it fit or the requirements for bug

1846
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:20,079
think it fit or the requirements for bug
 

1847
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,349
think it fit or the requirements for bug
reporting will be different

1848
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:21,359
reporting will be different
 

1849
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,790
reporting will be different
and stuff like that so it for us it's

1850
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:24,800
and stuff like that so it for us it's
 

1851
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,270

the bug and like
yeah you can specify these kind of

2038
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:39,280
yeah you can specify these kind of
 

2039
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,270
yeah you can specify these kind of
things and run that forever

2040
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:41,280
things and run that forever
 

2041
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,309
things and run that forever
in parallel but it doesn't cancel

definitely definitely
that's just that's all i said i mean

2048
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:49,599
that's just that's all i said i mean
 

2049
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,550
that's just that's all i said i mean
yeah i just dressed in this because uh

2050
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:52,560
yeah i just dressed in this because uh
 

2051
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,950
yeah i just dressed in this because uh
we see a lot of uh comments from the

2052
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:54,960
we see a lot of uh comments from the
 

2053
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,309
we see a lot of uh comments from the
community that

2054
00:40:56,309 --> 00:40:56,319
community that
 

2055
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,750
community that
uh this or that prize is not fair

2056
00:40:59,750 --> 00:40:59,760
uh this or that prize is not fair
 

2057
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,349
uh this or that prize is not fair
yeah because uh because one contest has

2058
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:03,359
yeah because uh because one contest has
 

2059
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,470
yeah because uh because one contest has
this price and this

2060
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:04,480
this price and this
 

2061
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,270
this price and this
this contest it has another price uh of

2062
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:07,280
this contest it has another price uh of
 

2063
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:07,670
this contest it has another price uh of
course

2064
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:07,680
course
 

2065
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,790
course
it's always uh can be disputed and

2066
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:10,800
it's always uh can be disputed and
 

2067
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,589
it's always uh can be disputed and
uh whatever but if we have a system that

2068
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:13,599
uh whatever but if we have a system that
 

2069
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,309
uh whatever but if we have a system that
says

2070
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:14,319
says
 

2071
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,630
says
that for such kind of contests we have

2072
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:16,640
that for such kind of contests we have
 

2073
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,750
that for such kind of contests we have
the price fund from this to that

2074
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:19,760
the price fund from this to that
 

2075
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,630
the price fund from this to that
it will be really transparent for people

2076
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:22,640
it will be really transparent for people
 

2077
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,829
it will be really transparent for people
and they will

2078
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:23,839
and they will
 

2079
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:28,530
and they will
understand all the conditions better

2080
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:28,540
understand all the conditions better
 

2081
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,910

bftg
 

2091
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,349
bftg
where it will we actually like

2092
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:41,359
where it will we actually like
 

2093
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,630
where it will we actually like
uh run a lot of like

2094
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:44,640
uh run a lot of like
 

2095
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,069
uh run a lot of like
thought in into that um of how

2096
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:48,079
thought in into that um of how
 

2097
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,109
thought in into that um of how
you actually price the contest

2098
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:53,119
you actually price the contest
 

2099
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,030
you actually price the contest
price pull the contest like what how you

2100
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:55,040
price pull the contest like what how you
 

2101
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,230
price pull the contest like what how you
calculate the price pool

2102
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:56,240
calculate the price pool
 

2103
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,150
calculate the price pool
can you do that automatically like what

2104
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:58,160
can you do that automatically like what
 

2105
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,069
can you do that automatically like what
should what the input should be to

2106
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:00,079
should what the input should be to
 

2107
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,470
should what the input should be to
calculate that and so on and so forth

2108
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:02,480
calculate that and so on and so forth
 

2109
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,510
calculate that and so on and so forth
and there is a solution like which we

2110
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:05,520
and there is a solution like which we
 

2111
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,430
and there is a solution like which we
will propose on the draft for of pftg

2112
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:07,440
will propose on the draft for of pftg
 

2113
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,150
will propose on the draft for of pftg
now i will publish it probably by monday

2114
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:10,160
now i will publish it probably by monday
 

2115
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,349
now i will publish it probably by monday
where like you only need to kind of

2116
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:13,359
where like you only need to kind of
 

2117
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,390
where like you only need to kind of
you only need to categorize what would

2118
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:16,400
you only need to categorize what would
 

2119
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,950
you only need to categorize what would
you pay in tokus for the best possible

2120
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:18,960
you pay in tokus for the best possible
 

2121
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,470
you pay in tokus for the best possible
solution to this problem

2122
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:22,480

 

2123
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,349

and what is the time duration that you

2124
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:25,359
and what is the time duration that you
 

2125
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:25,990
and what is the time duration that you
want

2126
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:26,000
want
 

2127
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,589
want
to kind of have that solution win

2128
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:29,599
to kind of have that solution win
 

2129
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,990
to kind of have that solution win
and from that we will construct

2130
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,000
and from that we will construct
 

2131
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,950
and from that we will construct
everything else

2132
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:32,960
everything else
 

2133
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,270
everything else
like all the rest of the contest price

2134
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:35,280
like all the rest of the contest price
 

2135
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:35,990
like all the rest of the contest price
pool

2136
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,000
pool
 

2137
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,270
pool
jury remuneration um

2138
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:39,280
jury remuneration um
 

2139
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,470
jury remuneration um
the jury voting time everything will be

2140
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:42,480
the jury voting time everything will be
 

2141
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,750
the jury voting time everything will be
like calculated from that now

2142
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:45,760
like calculated from that now
 

2143
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,790
like calculated from that now
then since there are tags attached to

2144
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:48,800
then since there are tags attached to
 

2145
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,870
then since there are tags attached to
each of the contests uh in bftg

2146
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:52,880
each of the contests uh in bftg
 

2147
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,829
each of the contests uh in bftg
you then can kind of collect statistics

2148
00:42:55,829 --> 00:42:55,839
you then can kind of collect statistics
 

2149
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:00,150
you then can kind of collect statistics
for the particular tag on usually like

2150
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:00,160
for the particular tag on usually like
 

2151
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,150
for the particular tag on usually like
what what are the parameters of the

2152
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:02,160
what what are the parameters of the
 

2153
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,829
what what are the parameters of the
particular attack

2154
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:03,839
particular attack
 

2155
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,510
particular attack
and we're we're talking about that there

2156
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:05,520
and we're we're talking about that there
 

2157
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,670
and we're we're talking about that there
so actually like

2158
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:07,680
so actually like
 

2159
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,750
so actually like
you can then parameterize text

2160
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:11,760
you can then parameterize text
 

2161
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,750
you can then parameterize text
on base of this like the contest that

2162
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:13,760
on base of this like the contest that
 

2163
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,670
on base of this like the contest that
you run and how successful they were

2164
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:15,680
you run and how successful they were
 

2165
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,109
you run and how successful they were
because we actually can measure the

2166
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:17,119
because we actually can measure the
 

2167
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,309
because we actually can measure the
successful

2168
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:18,319
successful
 

2169
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,109
successful
the the success of the contest in

2170
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:21,119
the the success of the contest in
 

2171
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:21,670
the the success of the contest in
reverse

2172
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:21,680
reverse
 

2173
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,670
reverse
in like so

2174
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:25,680
in like so
 

2175
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,270
in like so
then you will have like tags

2176
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:29,280
then you will have like tags
 

2177
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,349
then you will have like tags
and usual price pool attached to them

2178
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:33,359
and usual price pool attached to them
 

2179
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,069
and usual price pool attached to them
usual kind of the cost of the of the

2180
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:36,079
usual kind of the cost of the of the
 

2181
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,349
usual kind of the cost of the of the
best solution on that

2182
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:37,359
best solution on that
 

2183
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,750
best solution on that
attack and so on so you can kind of

2184
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:39,760
attack and so on so you can kind of
 

2185
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,710
attack and so on so you can kind of
construct things

2186
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:40,720
construct things
 

2187
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,710
construct things
and based on that of course they are not

2188
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:42,720
and based on that of course they are not
 

2189
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,109
and based on that of course they are not
up you know absolute and you always okay

2190
00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:45,119
up you know absolute and you always okay
 

2191
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,109
up you know absolute and you always okay
definitely definitely this is just just

2192
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:47,119
definitely definitely this is just just
 

2193
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,710
definitely definitely this is just just
just to give some reason original

2194
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:48,720
just to give some reason original
 

2195
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,390
just to give some reason original
but you have a few but you will have

2196
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:50,400
but you have a few but you will have
 

2197
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,790
but you have a few but you will have
some some stats you will have some

2198
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:52,800
some some stats you will have some
 

2199
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,470
some some stats you will have some
some data attached to each of this so

2200
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:56,480
some data attached to each of this so
 

2201
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,390
some data attached to each of this so
in a way that will kind of mitigate what

2202
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:00,400
in a way that will kind of mitigate what
 

2203
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,510
in a way that will kind of mitigate what
people

2204
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:01,520
people
 

2205
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,430
people
like say it's not fair or not fair

2206
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:03,440
like say it's not fair or not fair
 

2207
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,870
like say it's not fair or not fair
whatever or

2208
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:04,880
whatever or
 

2209
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,870
whatever or
time is not enough for whatever they say

2210
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:06,880
time is not enough for whatever they say
 

2211
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,069
time is not enough for whatever they say
usually yeah

2212
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:08,079
usually yeah
 

2213
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,270
usually yeah
yeah yeah right so of course it's it's

2214
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:11,280
yeah yeah right so of course it's it's
 

2215
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,870
yeah yeah right so of course it's it's
again it's not some kind of rule that

2216
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:12,880
again it's not some kind of rule that
 

2217
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,910
again it's not some kind of rule that
you cannot change but

2218
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:13,920
you cannot change but
 

2219
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,190
you cannot change but
but at least you will have some

2220
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:15,200
but at least you will have some
 

2221
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,550
but at least you will have some
guidelines and people will have some

2222
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:16,560
guidelines and people will have some
 

2223
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,030
guidelines and people will have some
guidelines to look at this

2224
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:18,040
guidelines to look at this
 

2225
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,109
guidelines to look at this
retrospectively and say okay so

2226
00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:21,119
retrospectively and say okay so
 

2227
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,790
retrospectively and say okay so
that's probably fair because it's in

2228
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:22,800
that's probably fair because it's in
 

2229
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,950
that's probably fair because it's in
line with what you know most of the time

2230
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:24,960
line with what you know most of the time
 

2231
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,430
line with what you know most of the time
with

2232
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:25,440
with
 

2233
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,510
with
you know community pays for that that

2234
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:27,520
you know community pays for that that
 

2235
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,190
you know community pays for that that
the results are good

2236
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:29,200
the results are good
 

2237
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,430
the results are good
you know and good results means to have

2238
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:31,440
you know and good results means to have
 

2239
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,550
you know and good results means to have
some

2240
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:32,560
some
 

2241
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,710
some
you know submissions at least three five

2242
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:34,720
you know submissions at least three five
 

2243
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,790
you know submissions at least three five
submissions for the contest

2244
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:36,800
submissions for the contest
 

2245
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,870
submissions for the contest
and the results of the contest are

2246
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:38,880
and the results of the contest are
 

2247
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,950
and the results of the contest are
usually in the high numbers of say

2248
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:40,960
usually in the high numbers of say
 

2249
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,390
usually in the high numbers of say
you know uh the submissions

2250
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:44,400
you know uh the submissions
 

2251
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,910
you know uh the submissions
marks jury marks then you can say okay

2252
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:47,920
marks jury marks then you can say okay
 

2253
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,710
marks jury marks then you can say okay
so this was

2254
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:48,720
so this was
 

2255
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,510
so this was
a successful contest and we run this

2256
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:51,520
a successful contest and we run this
 

2257
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,510
a successful contest and we run this
contest contest constantly like

2258
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:53,520
contest contest constantly like
 

2259
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,750
contest contest constantly like
in this tag and we have you know usually

2260
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:55,760
in this tag and we have you know usually
 

2261
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,270
in this tag and we have you know usually
successful cons with this parameter so

2262
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:57,280
successful cons with this parameter so
 

2263
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,950
successful cons with this parameter so
you can say okay you can say conveniency

2264
00:44:58,950 --> 00:44:58,960
you can say okay you can say conveniency
 

2265
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,470
you can say okay you can say conveniency
this is fair parameters because we have

2266
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:00,480
this is fair parameters because we have
 

2267
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,589
this is fair parameters because we have
the stats

2268
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:01,599
the stats
 

2269
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,069
the stats
okay okay fabrice you wanted to say

2270
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:04,079
okay okay fabrice you wanted to say
 

2271
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,109
okay okay fabrice you wanted to say
something

2272
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:05,119
something
 

2273
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,630
something
well i i just wanted to say that you you

2274
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:08,640
well i i just wanted to say that you you
 

2275
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,990
well i i just wanted to say that you you
instead of attaching the prices to

2276
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:12,000
instead of attaching the prices to
 

2277
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,589
instead of attaching the prices to
the software maybe you could

2278
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:15,599
the software maybe you could
 

2279
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,589
the software maybe you could
attach it to the impact of the attack

2280
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:19,599
attach it to the impact of the attack
 

2281
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,550
attach it to the impact of the attack
so for example you would have a an

2282
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:22,560
so for example you would have a an
 

2283
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,069
so for example you would have a an
amount of tokens for

2284
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:24,079
amount of tokens for
 

2285
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,030
amount of tokens for
if the attack is could block the world

2286
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,040
if the attack is could block the world
 

2287
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,790
if the attack is could block the world
blockchain for example

2288
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:28,800
blockchain for example
 

2289
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,390
blockchain for example
another one if can people can use it to

2290
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:32,400
another one if can people can use it to
 

2291
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:32,790
another one if can people can use it to
steal

2292
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:32,800
steal
 

2293
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,790
steal
tokens to people and on so forth

2294
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:36,800
tokens to people and on so forth
 

2295
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,589
tokens to people and on so forth
you you could uh instead of saying well

2296
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:39,599
you you could uh instead of saying well
 

2297
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,190
you you could uh instead of saying well
if it isn't live

2298
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:41,200
if it isn't live
 

2299
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,790
if it isn't live
or in this place well any attack on any

2300
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:44,800
or in this place well any attack on any
 

2301
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,510
or in this place well any attack on any
website that is used by the community a

2302
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:47,520
website that is used by the community a
 

2303
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,309
website that is used by the community a
lot

2304
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:48,319
lot
 

2305
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,790
lot
and that could be used to uh make people

2306
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:50,800
and that could be used to uh make people
 

2307
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,630
and that could be used to uh make people
believe something or

2308
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:52,640
believe something or
 

2309
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,910
believe something or
to do well to to take tokens from ex

2310
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:55,920
to do well to to take tokens from ex
 

2311
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,270
to do well to to take tokens from ex
for example from extraton i think

2312
00:45:59,270 --> 00:45:59,280
for example from extraton i think
 

2313
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,510
for example from extraton i think
the the the idea is not that they can

2314
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:01,520
the the the idea is not that they can
 

2315
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,190
the the the idea is not that they can
attack this software of this sovereign

2316
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:03,200
attack this software of this sovereign
 

2317
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,550
attack this software of this sovereign
one this other software

2318
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:04,560
one this other software
 

2319
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,870
one this other software
it's whether they can steal tokens

2320
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:06,880
it's whether they can steal tokens
 

2321
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,030
it's whether they can steal tokens
whether they can block the network

2322
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:09,040
whether they can block the network
 

2323
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,150
whether they can block the network
whether they can block one validator

2324
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:12,160
whether they can block one validator
 

2325
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,349
whether they can block one validator
or well do uh targeted attacks

2326
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:15,359
or well do uh targeted attacks
 

2327
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:19,190
or well do uh targeted attacks
uh uh i i would the the amounts would be

2328
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:19,200
uh uh i i would the the amounts would be
 

2329
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:19,990
uh uh i i would the the amounts would be
different

2330
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:20,000
different
 

2331
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,550
different
uh from that point of view instead of

2332
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:22,560
uh from that point of view instead of
 

2333
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,230
uh from that point of view instead of
the software that it is being being

2334
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:24,240
the software that it is being being
 

2335
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,349
the software that it is being being
attacked

2336
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:25,359
attacked
 

2337
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,990
attacked
yeah i agree i agree i agree and we

2338
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:28,000
yeah i agree i agree i agree and we
 

2339
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,270
yeah i agree i agree i agree and we
actually discussed this

2340
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:29,280
actually discussed this
 

2341
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,470
actually discussed this
with our team that uh in fact

2342
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:32,480
with our team that uh in fact
 

2343
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,390
with our team that uh in fact
the motivation for reporting the back

2344
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:34,400
the motivation for reporting the back
 

2345
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,150
the motivation for reporting the back
should be enough

2346
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:36,160
should be enough
 

2347
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,390
should be enough
for a guy to report instead of exploit

2348
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:38,400
for a guy to report instead of exploit
 

2349
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,550
for a guy to report instead of exploit
so uh

2350
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:40,560
so uh
 

2351
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,589
so uh
so yeah this is

2352
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:43,599
so yeah this is
 

2353
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,630
so yeah this is
said truth yeah so and uh if there is a

2354
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:46,640
said truth yeah so and uh if there is a
 

2355
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,910
said truth yeah so and uh if there is a
protocol which

2356
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:47,920
protocol which
 

2357
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,309
protocol which
in which there are i don't know millions

2358
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:50,319
in which there are i don't know millions
 

2359
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,910
in which there are i don't know millions
of dollars locked

2360
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:51,920
of dollars locked
 

2361
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,550
of dollars locked
so and the guy finds a zero zero day

2362
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:54,560
