hi guys
hey
okay so wait for few more minutes
traditionally and
then we will start
hmm
hi everybody hi hi
we are too few today i hope people will
join us
shortly
kyle hi pavel hi
i see that i am first in the agenda
that's great
yes yes that's great because actually i
have to live in half an hour
no no problem no problem i will just
introduce the agenda and give you the
word
uh okay i see that there are quite
enough people for
for today so welcome everyone and our
status third
weekly defy governance call so we have
few
uh interesting topics to discuss today
some of them you have
already seen and some of them uh are
quite new
so uh we will start with uh
a staked uh tone uh discussion
i think it's pronounced correctly
uh then vladimir said uh that he
unfortunately
could not um connect but i will just
give you a short update on the
self-sovereign identity uh
contest uh and also a few
updates about onbridge and tom swapp so
many of you may have seen
that so we have run a big maintenance
the day before yesterday and i will just
explain what was this
and why is it important and sergey will
also
tell about new farming programs so
uh pavel please the floor is yours so uh
tell us more about uh steak
yes exactly so yeah this is quite uh
it's not hard to do in our case because
we have amazing people
contact uh and actually friton was the
first
who started that trend and now this
trend
uh we see it mean in other blockchains
when
where people uh take a nice state uh
rights or state tokens
now in our case it is uh true
state tokens because they are
decentralized they do
do not rely on
on any relay um so
in our case uh such tokens can be
again true um so
uh yeah i thought that it is quite
easy and quite short contest of course i
mean i got some comments that
it probably will require more time and
will require more effort
and i agree with that i think that
in order not to to spoil this one let's
increase timing less for for i don't
know
uh four weeks or something like that
yeah i think
one month is sufficient for such a type
of contest
yeah um so
and what i think also is quite
interesting
which i didn't thought in the first
place one wrote that contest that
it's not about only ordinary stakes
because ordinary stakes
you can withdraw any time and though and
they
are such stakes are
kind of funchable so they are equal but
what is
amazing that we have also westing
tokens and the wasting and rights for
wasting
tokens they depended on term of
of of the investing so in that respect
i think uh the such tokens
can differ depending on amount number of
uh cycles they are requested for
so it means that we will have like
100 different types of stacked tones
uh which will represent different
wasting times
and this is i think very interesting
because uh
it reminds me uh yield curve
such thing from uh finance industry
which actually and people do quite uh
interesting strategies on top of that so
when
they play with yield curve they think
like
that that curves change over time
uh so i think it will be nice especially
taking the card that
decks are coming so we'll have not only
one stake tom will have like
many of them so i will make adjustments
to that uh contest and if there are no
other questions let's put it on
yeah i i just uh had a look through
through the contest and yes
i agree that it definitely needs more
time than 10 days because
uh first of all it needs
some time to to build the architecture
of this
of this stuff because we start from the
implementation part
and uh second test pavel said
there is not only ordinary stakes but
also western stakes and it
also needs some time to think through
but in my opinion one month is
sufficient
so unless anyone has
some some other opinions that can be
justified
and uh if it's if it's so
so and but we can just make some
amendments so
probably we will be able even to launch
it uh
on monday probably so it's it's not that
complex as
dexes or bridges so it's just
a set of smart contracts pretty much uh
standards uh tip3 token i think
with some additional functionality on
top of this
uh yeah and also what i would like to
recommend
is first to have a look
on different types of tipster tokens
that already exists
and choose the one that you
think is most suitable yeah for not to
invent the intimate the wheel
and just build your solution on top of
this
i have one uh question actually
let me take a look media is here uh yeah
he's here
okay great uh me there um so we
discussed it
uh some time ago uh that wrapping the
the
the question is that uh you need to be
sure
that you got transfer from
deepu correct people contact so
in that respect i guess there are some
changes
in virtual machine we had where you can
check
the hash of initial uh contracts so
when it will be introduced because i
think this this functionality
should be important for that particular
contest because without it
it could be problematic to me to make
generic uh
wrapper because we don't want to have
for each
different uh token
because again if the pools are waiting
you you can check the crash code of the
pool right now
right so you don't need
this this this uh checking it has
checked the initiative
is not for that it's for verifying that
the address was calculated correctly
initially from the write code
um so so this is this is i don't know
how
if you have a depool it doesn't matter
what what was the default address
or what is the default address it's the
the right
um question to ask is what is the cash
contract right now
right so and you can you can check that
so and it's it's not the bull has
transfer
mechanism so you can easily create a
contract
which will take the the tokens
so someone if someone wants you know
this
the to use this um whatever the
functionality
of that contract is like liquidity or
whatever
so he first of all this person need to
trust this contract
right so that's that's a totally other
issue like you okay so you
we create some few contracts like that
we're formally verified and whatever
now everyone trusts them like the
trustee pools
so now now everyone can can take
the their stake in depool just
call a transfer function transfer it to
this
contract that they trust now
this contract once the tokens are
transferred inside the depool
will issue whatever tokens or whatever
it wants to issue it doesn't matter what
the functionality of that is
right there is nothing preventing we
already have
examples of that for example smv the c
plus plus s and v contracts both
solidity s and v contracts are already
using this
there is uh what was produced already in
january
like the the so they use the depot
transfer
for that so you can you can transfer
your depool stake and immediately get
tip three tokens to vote in smv contract
yeah i think yeah me i understand i'm
just saying that
it should be for all uh
all the pools so it is for because all
gpus has the same code
yeah it means that yeah okay it means
that uh that
work and if you have a depool code if
you have it if you check that it's a
real this contract is a real depool
meaning hash
code is correct then it doesn't have a
set code so
no no no malicious party can use that to
kind of to steal your money or to to
fake a depo
you cannot fake the poor country
okay great so um
so our element will
add that some
ideas about adding also wasting tokens
functionality it will be like not
mandatory but it will be like
additional critique right so soft
criteria
okay and i also ask you if possible
uh can you also have a look on the
contest proposal
and maybe give some recommendations on
on the implementation part
uh so sure that you believe will
function well with depot contracts
sure if if you can shoot me
right now all right okay okay very good
uh thank you pavel so i hope that we
will finalize it
this contest terms by monday and we'll
launch it
so to attract more interest more more
teams
for this also small but important task
okay so we move to the second uh point
in our agenda it is the self-sovereign
identity uh architecture and design so
uh we had
two uh good presentations by vladimir
uh on the previous defy call and this
week uh
main governance goal and uh
now it's pretty clear why why it is
important
uh to to develop
such kind of solution but
as it is not an easy one
definitely so first we as usual
run through the design architecture
stage
and uh we discussed flood image this
morning that
this contest will be held i think in a
couple of weeks
so to give a warm-up period and let's
distribute the news about such contests
across teams
so uh the contest proposal is almost
ready and vladimir put
probably already managed to share it or
we'll share it today
uh so and hopefully uh we will launch it
on monday as well
uh if you uh feel capable to participate
so please
so everyone's welcome and if you know
some teams that's
proficient in ssi so uh please invite
them as well because we need more strong
developers
in free tone so it will be useful for
for all of us
okay and uh now we move
to the recent updates to the town bridge
and town swap so um
some of you have heard about what media
said
this on this week weekly call that there
were some
some uh contracts that
uh managed to stall the network
and uh to some extent and uh
we also analyzed the situation and
also ground grounded on the security
audit that we
had on the bridge it it's almost
finished and
we working in uh closely with
audit teams it has already been fixed by
the way
yeah yeah it's already been fixed but
still uh we uh also
had another look on our contracts and
understood that but
but but the patch is not on the main net
yet
yeah i remember that yeah so yeah yeah i
don't remember try to run it at home
i i remember at all at all absolutely
and
uh so uh we strongly improved the
security of both solutions
uh and redeployed the boss bridge
and uh don't swap io so now it's
it's uh even more secure and reliable
than before although it it's already
have been like this but
there were some very very narrow and
specific situations where
uh an attacker could stall the bridge
uh not just uh take the money but
uh really intervene and stall it
so now it's not normal possible and uh
guys from brock's team are working now
hard hard
to implement dao in both projects and
i i hope that it will come
within a month probably i would be brave
to say this
it's not an easy task at all but we're
working hard on this
and uh we also added
uh one more important uh
thing i will show to you now uh
that you will like probably especially
if you tried already
to participate in the previous farming
program
that we uh pilot farming programs that
we launched a few weeks ago
so actually we added the farming
constructor
uh at tonsoipaio so that lets you
to create the farming pool uh specifying
the
talking route that needs to be deposited
and
the the token that is paid as a reward
to you and you can just input the amount
of the rewards it
will be distributed and then
put it on this deployed contract so
it's that easy and once you have this
specific token you can see the list of
farming pools so and just
deposit it here it works uh
in uh to go together with a
tone crystal uh extension so that
currently
serves as a tone client for the app
and if you try for example to
like i did here i already put some lp
tokens
from uh from the pool here so if i try
to claim
it will just initiate the transaction
to withdraw and pretty the same to
deposit
so and and to claim your reward so it's
now significantly easier to to
participate in farming
and uh i will give now
a word to sergey shachev who will
announce
the next farming programs so it will be
run run started from today
sorry alina has a question
yeah i thought maybe a weird question
why the project has
the same name the same name as uh the
project
which is already exists uh in fact tom
swapp
appeared a lot long before tons of payer
and we had our otc solutions
built there and now we host our decks
here
and yeah so
we took this name a bit earlier sorry
okay let's let's show
ah i i need a permission for sure yeah
sure just a second
i propose to discuss this in person
yeah thank you please
one moment
yeah i'll show my screen i created first
first pull here it's like sims from my
side
we will put 50 000
tons to four different pools
one pole will be with usdt second pole
with
usdc i created with the liquid with
spool
a third pole vfb with ethereum and the
last pole vfb
will have rapid btc and we will put
50k tokens for old spool and of course
we will continue our uni swap program
and to uni swap program we will put
50 i will put 200k tokens
like in previous experiment farming
program
will work during two weeks uh
and we got new players
uh some some liquidity providers
who will create lots of experiments with
us
and the next stage after this
experiments
uh we will analyze and we will create
some content with analytics
and different farming between unisop and
between decks in uh infiriton and of
course
uh costs uh into slope will be less
other than in unisop
and after afraid i think we will start
uh
industrial farming program uh in uh
different decks
uh who will who will be ready for it and
uh who will set different liquidity
and um we will start partnerships
with big farming project like
same strategy used by polygon matic
and we started to work with
different uh protocols like like our one
inch
frags and etc and uh
magic bring uh some person to full
network
to these big players and the faith matic
got more than six billion liquidity
and thousands and thousand different
users
and we will set up same strategy i think
we will start from
frags it's one of the most uh
algorithmic stable coin in market and
i say it we will attract protocol by
protocol
to frito network
thanks again and yeah uh as you can see
from the screen so
the first uh farming program starts from
uh
6 p.m today so all you need to do is
uh have your lp tokens ready uh
and place on your crystal wallet
extension
so we are also writing uh currently
manuals
for if you want to use for example anton
cli or some other
clients to stake in the farming pool
uh but at least on on the interface
level so it's i think it's
quite easy to understand how to use it
so if you have any issues
with it so don't hesitate to uh come to
brock's chat and ask so we'll
we're always there to help you so and
some menus hopefully
uh are coming later today or maybe
earlier uh
tomorrow and uh second uh important
point
uh is that currently we do not
upgrade the unison pool to the version
three
uh because it's uh uh
nft tokens that they can't they are
currently using they are not yet
compatible with the bridge
or the bridge is not yet compatible with
them so we are still analyzing how to
support this version 3 of uniswop and
until then you can still use
your version 2 liquidity provider
tokens to participate in the farming
program
so if you have them already on the town
network so
just just use interface to stake them
and
if you have transferred them back and
want to get them to to the toe network
so used on bridge
but important thing is that uh
ton bridge website not yet works uh
with with extension so hopefully we will
improve with this
by end of the week uh but uh for this
time
if you want to transfer anything from
ethereum to
to tone still use the desktop clients
please
so hopefully we will get rid of this and
[Music]
support the extension in all our
products
but it takes some time yeah and
also about liquidity from the file yarns
members
and different our partners we will put
one million dollar
to for liquidity pools index
okay thank you sergey
yes let's rock let's rock that's pretty
it for for today's agenda so if you have
some other topics to discuss so uh
please raise a hand
and say something
yes pablo please yes we have one more
topic to discuss uh there is uh
we don't hear you also so
yeah i have one more to discuss as you
know we had the
first stage of our june
friton bridge finished with
specification
actually there was a winning submission
and now we have since
it long quite for a time uh we
have to start the second phase of that
uh fabrice created that contest
for bishop uh
since i remember there was a comment
that
defies our sub governors didn't have
budget for that so we
plan to vote for it
on global governments but since there
are no
experience in global governance
for that so uh it is written that
that contest should use defy uh jury
okay yeah unfortunately i was a bit
overwhelmed to help fabrice in
uh launching this contest so
thanks to him so he managed to do this
himself
so yeah please go and check it's
published was on forum and in the
governance interface and if you plan to
participate
as well so just all the details are
there
okay uh any other topics guys please
seems too yeah yeah it's maybe not about
topics about general
uh situation uh yesterday we had
a very interesting market uh because
it's uh flash sales
tweeted no no it was
good it's more about about pr uh so
about market yesterday
uh in real situations yesterday uh
ethereum didn't work totally didn't work
transaction in network was near to one
one thousand dollar and it was some
minutes
and during this situation
a lot of funds got liquidation position
and they had no and they
had no any possibility to add liquidity
in this moment
because all the excess uh
all exchanges didn't work didn't work at
the
under real high load uh during uh flash
uh during uh flash selling from
different different people
binance didn't guidance didn't work too
a lot of time
uh cmc didn't work uh
sometimes too and uh a lot of
a lot of funds uh a lot of uh
very aggressive traders who
got a big risk for big profitability
yesterday lost all
and yeah and and one of the reason
reason why
in real situation they had no any
possibility to educate
it was blood totally blood
night of bloody yes through food makes
makes sense so you should you should
have spare throughput for such
possession yeah yeah they they said
layer two i heard right
why didn't they go there too regis
what's wrong with layer twos guys
where are the layer tools it's
it was magic
in the magic all protocols
work good because we had a personal
position in magic
and they had no any problems
but uh not a lot of protocol used it now
and it's how it's our chance because all
fans discovered
uh how it worked in reality of a big
transaction about the federal network
and so i think that this situation a lot
of protocols and investors
will will start work with layer 2
different protocols like matic
and they hope that we will get part of
this pipe
because uh this today's internet and
browser
saturates uh it's very good but it's it
will
set a lot of a lot of time
to bring it to people
[Music]
it never happened what happened again
okay uh okay guys
so if there are no more other topics to
discuss so thank you
everyone for attending today's call and
see you in a week and
don't forget that you have the farming
opportunity
so waiting for you to answer the tayo
see you bye-bye
