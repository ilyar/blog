all right everyone
so uh welcome to our 22nd
weekly governance course of the d5
return group
it's a good day today so we have several
news several updates and
uh so let's let's make it sweet
so first of all i will just drop you
some news and updates about
the brooks bridge hotenbridge ios you
know it
what's going on what happened over the
previous two weeks and what's coming
future
next we'll discuss the stable contest uh
leaded by alexander vartakin so uh there
are also some updates and some
topics for discussion uh next wintex
team is ready to present the
second stage of the polka dot bridge
demo so we will
have a good show today and also last but
not least uh
we will discuss the upgrade of tip three
standards and uh i
really hope that meteo will attend also
and uh
we'll i'm here oh you're here very good
very good so
uh there are several questions from the
community that we will discuss a bit
later so pl please don't don't leave
so let's start from from the news uh
actually
as announced over the previous weekly
main governance call so ton bridge io
has launched the small
bug bounty program and it
lasted for over one week and we
really grateful for all the community
members who participated and
helped us to improve the quality of the
bridge
and uh we are now collecting the results
and
we'll be announcing some special prizes
uh
i guess it will be early next week also
what we are doing now so we are
preparing the big bug bounty program so
uh
that will present i hope next week
uh that just precedes the formal
security audit
of the breach so uh and there will be
some good prizes so
just keep subscribed and guys uh
you will get to know first when it
starts
and yes all those who have submitted
their current box they will also be
eligible for participation
so uh the only formal criteria is
uh to publish it's a bug found in one of
the
bridge and
so the bug should be unique
next uh and another news about onbc so
we have deployed
uh root contracts for all other tokens
that we promised so it's
namely usdc dye robbed ethereum and
dropped btc
so uh i will publish root addresses
today in the define group so just keep
an eye on it and you can easily
add them to your crystal wallet or use
it through
any other interface as you as you wish
um yep uh so
now the second topic is a stable coin
contest so alexander here
yes i am so the floor is yours please
hello everyone maybe
you saw yesterday
my polls post in uh defile group
about stages of
development stablecoin contest
the ram was if we look in decks
there was four stages
and
it was more or less uh uh
possible uh good um separate
these four stages uh and do
uh some smart counter contracts in one
stage and the second
and after that did some
liquidity mechanism and
[Music]
ux yes interfaces
um in stable coin i tried to do in the
same way
on the separate on four stages
and but uh it was
i didn't know how to do it i talked with
different
people about and we don't have uh one
good opinion how to do it
in different stages
now i put some
in group some plus on my message
yes uh where we i
suggest to think about how to do it
and if somebody can help and
now maybe we discuss a
different opinion how to do
different stages uh for stable con
context
uh the main problem that uh in stable
coin
everything so connects to each uh other
but
uh for example if we
did some stable coil uh
without uh um for example cdp
and oracles it's it's nothing
if we do stable coin and some alone or
cdp
mechanism and without oracles how we can
test it
it didn't work for my opinion
uh and even uh to make oracles
without a stablecoin mechanism
it's mechanine for stabilization um
can we test it
maybe oracle yes but
what we do with different than other
things
let's discuss if you have who has some
opinions about it
and maybe somebody can help me
yes please raise hands
well i will ignite uh so uh yeah dimitri
please
yeah you can say we don't hear you
can you hear me no yes no
okay please thank you uh thank you for a
good informative uh proposal for four
stages
but uh my i think about
some real implementation in which stage
uh do everybody see
the real implementation and launch of
that stable coin so somebody can
try to try to evaluate how stable it
could be and how the stabilization works
in real life
maybe we should have the last stage for
a real implementation
when the launch real launch of that
stable
coin should be what do you think
uh what do you recommend for example the
first step
uh no i i agree with your stages
yes okay i think that
they this overall task is uh
very complex and it's hard to divide but
uh i think it's reasonable to make some
stages
just like you wrote your proposal i
think
it's good steps
um yes okay
for example maslikov
uh recommend yesterday um
maybe um two stage
uh there are various set of deck smart
contracts
uh where is smart contracts for stable
coin
and government governance coins
and all mechanisms smart contracts of
the long
cdp or calculation of index to do it in
one step
it's good idea in case that
it's really possible to test
together but it's better idea that
i think it's 70 or 80 percent of
all work and we start to discuss
maybe uh to do longer uh uh
stage with maybe three months
but um i know i'm not sure
that it's a good idea
to do one deep step for
long time we will wait for example three
months and
in the end realize that don't have
nothing
it's better to do like scrum uh
little steps more or less like scrub
yet medley please yes i think that
we should definitely have some
measurable
measurable goals for each stage so we
can
somehow judge some participants
and understand who
did the better uh one
uh that's the main point and uh the
uh if if we have the large stage
uh which longs for several months it's
it uh
is a lesser lesser problem than the
measure measurable
some goals for each stage yeah
great media please yeah i
i kind of i'm lost because uh
how the x contest is related to stable
coin contest first um
if you look in my message um at first
i um show how it was in dex
contest only that it was four states and
it was uh more or less
different steps with different
mechanisms and uh
are now about stable coin how we can do
here well unlike example
yes understood well the designs of
stable coins
and i'm of course referring to like our
design with andrew for example
are very different from other designs
for example
and i'm not sure we can pack it
into steps that would be universal for
all the designs so if there are several
teams that would design
several architectures of stablecoin
which are completely different
the design steps are not the same and
they don't make sense
for example for us to start with a smart
contract what is smart contract for
stable coin
in i mean we have a completely different
kind of situation we have a one uh
one a set of contracts which are
responsible for collecting
oracle prices from validators and
another set of con
contracts which are the the weekly
option
the weekly auction for the for the price
stabilization
and the pool so
you know like our auction yeah
so yeah um i would not know where to
start here
like what what what applies to this
now okay uh at least i think
more or less three separate stage we
have first
it's uh some uh type of stabilization
with stable coin
second it's oracle and third it's a ux
do you agree with this or not well
i don't because in our case you have two
stabilization mechanisms
one a liquidity mechanism
and then uh interfaces
and since i believe that the interfaces
and there are different interfaces by
the way there is a different interface
for validators
there is you know for staking and all
that stuff and then there is a different
interface for
um for liquidity pool providers and
or reserve mechanism i would say and
there is a different interface for
auction
and also auctions has a different
interfaces one is for large
uh buyers and sellers and another is for
um you know for retail
so and there is a special contract for
retail by the way
so i would not know
which stage applied to which part of our
implementation
in this like i would propose to make it
maybe more i would say general
or even having it at one stage and just
saying you know
just do the implementation of whatever
you want you have like three four months
to do that and that's it
maybe uh we can somehow define uh the
scope of
mvp so what we consider in the pins is
in this case so
uh before then for
each yeah i agree that let's say but
it's the same as i said like
let's everyone will create an mvp and
mvp means
you know you cannot you know you're not
going to
expect it to be launched on the mainnet
um
but it should provide mechanics and may
may lack some features
something like that but just very
generalized uh description
i think because then the mvp in our case
would mean very different uh have made
very different meanings from meaning
from the
mvp of some other implementation i think
but it's a better idea to
separate stages not by
functionality or by readiness yes
maybe it's easy yeah yeah because
everything
in general right yes then in general but
if you talk about in the
minimum value product it's mean that
value we have
at least every team
need to give minimal value it's mean
that
you can try you can test this is for
example
in my case for example it's stable coil
that
without governance mechanism without uh
sorry i i don't think that has to do
anything with the government because
governance mechanisms for example in our
case you don't have a governance
mechanism
it's built into the into the
system and there is no you cannot
separate if you
but um i think what stablecoin need to
prove
on the mvp stage is actually the
stability
so we need to be able to um
to actually kind of test the stability
by
inflicting a price rapid price changes
downwards particularly and that should
be the test case scenario
but how you can do that without if if
there is a mechanism based on value
like based on some perception of the
price
then you cannot test it simply speaking
you just won't be able to test it
because the game mechanics will not
be it cannot be simulated without money
at stake
now for example in your case uh you can
start
mvp without uh decentralized
not nodes uh
yes we can we can emulate the prices yes
and relate to prices and uh
but but but it won't what i'm saying is
that it won't prove anything
and the most important part in any
stable coin isn't stability
so on on the we're doing the mvp level
but it's
really just an mvp of the i would say
functioning system with some user
interfaces blah blah blah but
we can we won't be able to test actually
how this coin
is going to really uh behave
on in the real economic scenario
right so we are not we're not going to
be how we are going to
kind of what what the um
what the judgments like uh
measurement should be okay guys i see
that we have somehow stalked a bit here
and
so we have one more hand raised uh
let's listen to ivan
maybe he has some good ideas i just
wanted to ask a question because like
i'm not
really uh expert so so the
the the question is uh why do we need ux
for stable coin contest like why are we
even mentioned
ux stage like because the does usdt have
ux does die yes yeah it has
well it's a product like it's a product
but
we don't speak a product we speaking
about like
implementation of of coin like
smart contracts no
if we talk about for example make it
down
uh if you don't you will not have
interface for loan and
this mechanism that somebody can give
money and somebody
can take money uh it's really
will not work like stable coin mechanism
uh in different stable coin different
for example
uh like usdt or we have uh in our
design contest we had uh some
uh submission whereas stability more or
less like usdt but
uh not without uh with um
digital cryptocurrency there are
no need special uix because
there are no some liquidity mechanism or
lawn or cdp it's mean that
in really in here ivan you are right
sometimes uh no need
uh to speak about uh ux but sometimes
yes
like i just wanted to my opinion is like
if if
smart system works then you don't need
ux to to some to proof or to like
you don't need ux contest to say to say
that
okay we are ready
yes it is just my opinion yeah i'm
finished
i think at this point we don't know
maybe
tbot interface will be enough but
because we don't have a working
implementation of debot interface
i mean we do but we don't have that many
examples
uh which can use it in production ready
system then why
that's why we are kind of hedging this
risk and
we we don't know yet maybe we won't need
this ui
use interface stage maybe we will
but we decided to put it in the context
description
so to show everyone that if by that time
we don't have
uh working or stable enough prototype or
the community decides that it's not
enough the keyboard interface is not
enough
it's not very convenient to use then
we'll
have the last stage dedicated to ux and
ui
and by the way the same logic applies to
dex contest
makes sense thank you
okay uh so what's
what's the solution so we need
to agree on the next steps then so we
should we make some kind of first meteor
proposed more generic description
of this mvp stage
what do you think guys
maybe we collect today tomorrow some
opinion more
and if no will better
opinion maybe we make
maybe not four maybe three stage and
start from
test from mvp second
[Music]
maybe already first maybe i'll
bear some second mvp and third ready
product with interface if it's neat or
depots
maybe like that okay
what i propose is uh let's let's maybe
finalize some kind of
vision of this contest publish it and
if there will be no big criticism
until monday i would say let's publish
it and run it
so because we discussed for a long time
and we need to move on with it
yeah but one more meter um you said that
the no the main things in stabilization
but uh maybe not all submission
um use special mechanism for
stabilization
for example some stable coils
need for stabilization market makers and
not automatic market makers
i read some of uh submission and the
remaining
mechanism it's still a mechanism my
point is um
yes you mean that even your mechanism
for stabilization you need uh
used market makers even not automatic
you need to give this mechanism for
market making and not only that you need
also to provide
the risk they doesn't matter who
or what should risk something in order
to verify
the the that this that the stable coin
works for example
like even in the usd scenario
well if usdt if suddenly we tomorrow
all of us know that there are there is
no collateral
in the in the form of u.s dollars in
some bank account
and it backed by nothing the well you
will
you kind of know what will happen to its
price right
yes so yeah so without the actual risk
kind of uh factor in this game mechanic
you will not be able to uh
judge if the stable coin works or not
yes but in case with usdt i think they
didn't have special mechanism in this
case
this is the mechanism the fact that they
collectorize
you real us dollars in their bank
account is the stabilization mechanism
and everyone else on the market believes
that they really
have at least some of these dollars
backing of the the usdt because if the
market would not believe so
the price of the usdt would be zero
but uh if for example they have uh
80 percent of characterization on 70 it
doesn't mean that if yes it means
yes it does meaning that uh right now
that's why a lot of out money went out
of usdt
rapidly when they were like the the
audit
uh which which you know all this story
so basically it affects
the liquidity of the and after reaching
certain point in liquidity
um there the you would see the collapse
of the price of
usdt and therefore that's why they
actually agreed in the end to this audit
so they do have some usd some dollars
making that
up in the bank account otherwise you
know otherwise we would see the
the the the price collapse so what i my
point is that on any stable coin
mechanism doesn't matter what it is
if it's automatic or not automatic fully
on chain on on chain off chain
combination or fully off chain
you still need a real value behind this
mechanism
to test if this if the coin is stable
because for example
if tomorrow some guy who is known crook
like a convicted felon
will uh issue a stable coin and will say
i back this stable coin with dollars in
my account i don't think this
uh this stable coin will you know have
any value
so it's also it's also depends not only
in some points
not only depends on the algorithms it
can depend also on the
like for example someone's um reputation
but it's still a market and gay
mechanics mechanism
okay
right any other points on the opinions
on this
three two one no good uh in this case we
go to the next uh topic on today's
agenda so
uh wintex team is going to present the
second stage of
polka dot bridge so alex please
yes good day everyone uh vladislav can i
ask you to
allow us to share a screen already
already done
dimitri yeah dmitry pablo okay can
everyone see
all right um the second milestone has
come to an end
and we are ready to present you the
transfer
of tokens between the two blockchains
which is a
substrate based chain and uh
free tone chain uh it was very very hot
in developing past few weeks
we just finished and we will start the
demonstration now
as usual we are starting the two nodes
on the screen as you can see
one is a free turn node and another is a
substrate base node
okay it's ready
setup sense let's start the setup
okay this setup sends the initial value
to contracts and deploy them
to a local tone node also set up
a substrate node for interacting with
doton protocol
now we are waiting for containers to
finish the setup
it may take some time but it will happen
let's wait for this
okay while this happening uh we we
finish only the second stage out
of four which means we are ready to
transfer the tokens themselves but we
still have so much to do in upfront of
us
like the economics part of it and etc
etc
okay let's see how it's going
please bear with us it will happen
okay it's uh it's done now
so we are starting the relay node or
bridge node itself
okay it's all started well okay we will
start transfer the first transfer will
be from substrate base node
to a free tone node and to do this we
set the balance
to account with a name of ton recipient
yep okay this one uh it is zero now as
you can see
and we will top it up by
10 000 for example as an example
this is needed because we are in the
development mode right now
okay uh as we can see the balance has
has it changed
yeah okay we got the 10 000
[Music]
okay we are initiating the transfer of
tokens from substrate account
to well okay let's see the address
to which uh we will top up the balance
okay we see the pre-deployed wallet in a
free tone network
as you can see the balance is zero right
now
and the address we're copying the
address to which we will
send the money
one second okay we will send 1000
as an example and let's sign the
transaction
okay signing is successful now we check
in the relay node log to see when the
relay node will show us
that it is got the event
once again it may take some time for the
blockchain to
process this information
okay the relay node is attempting to
send a proposal about the token transfer
it approves itself because at this stage
we have uh
only one relayer
one second
okay i think we have a little bit of a
trouble we will try to
troubleshoot it right now
i think we copied the wrong address
let's try again okay so why
one second
okay we will try to send one more time
because the address we copied was wrong
just a typo nothing to worry about okay
and we are waiting in relay node again
the message
one second
okay now it's all done the address is
correct uh everything has happened relay
node is attempted
and because we have only one relayer we
sign it signed itself that transaction
now let's
check our balance on the free tone side
one second yeah
one two
three
sometimes that might take some time
because then
okay just a minute we will
check to see what's going on
[Music]
we um trouble only sister
okay i think it may be because we have
sent
twice and the noun was repeated twice
the same noun
okay i'm sorry we started from yeah
we one second maybe we should start
from the beginning what do you think
from
from the very beginning yeah yeah okay
we will try to redeploy everything i'm
sorry terribly terribly sorry this
happened because of the typo the noun
has doubled it up
it was working just a second ago
just a human mistake
okay we once again we're restarting the
nodes
and
start the setup as well
[Music]
so we need finish for the notes
okay
when the relay node yeah ready this
one second guys let us let us check how
it starts
okay just a second bear with us please
okay okay well back
almost back where we left it the last
time one second
i'm sorry we've checked this like a
million times and it was working
and as usual on the presentation it has
to go wrong
absolutely it was working like a million
uh we will
try to send once again uh we're starting
from the zero
we top up the balance of the user
uh which is a tone recipient user by ten
thousand
okay
[Music]
okay
now we copy the address now without a
mistake this time around
and we will try to send this well we
will send this
to an address
that we copied just now
yeah we will we will send one thousand
because we have ten thousand on a
balance
we will send just a part of it partial
okay
we're just making sure that every every
letter is correct with sorry
signing the transaction and
submit
okay the balance has some money has gone
away which is a thousand and now we
we're waiting for that money
in in another blockchain
now we are we are still in a relay node
waiting for the
event to happen okay okay now it's
gone well let's check the balance on uh
uh yeah on the free tone side
see if it has happened it was zero
let's check the balance okay finally
we go a thousand tokens dtn
on the balance which is a perfect result
okay all done uh
now let's see how the transfer tokens
the opposite way when we try to send
money for
try to set tokens i'm sorry in a console
sending
let's say 100 yes
100 ton to our substrate
we are sending yep
and the second transaction yeah with the
zeros
yeah with the zero amount because the
local tone doesn't produce the
empty blocks so in a bridge log
we can see the proposal yes it came
through
now we check the balance on the
substrate
side uh it's supposed to increase
hold on a second let's see okay the
balance has increased and let's see the
transaction details that it exactly 100
yep
okay uh just just to explain the numbers
on the substrate account are not whole
uh because there was a commission on the
substrate side when we
transfer the money first so to conclude
the token transfer between blockchains
uh we also wanted to say in regards to
continuous integration that we have
created
a few scripts to
build and deliver our docket containers
to docker hub
which will improve the delivery process
in the future for the next milestones
in a system and everything that we have
demonstrated today
we are we will be ready to deploy
tomorrow to the github
and the documentation as well we will
update it by tomorrow
so everything we have shown you will see
and you can check yourself
starting from tomorrow and as always we
asking the teams to join in testing and
checking this milestone
it was very hot and nice if
during the check you have any questions
we are welcoming everyone to ask these
questions we will participate we will
try to
work together and if you have anything
or any questions
uh i'm sure we can resolve those
and back to you i think uh vlad
what is love yes thank you so much
guys do you have any questions for the
winter team
really no
come on don't be shy okay we we are
sorry again
it didn't supposed to break down
it's okay always on the public
demonstrations
something must fail yes
can you repeat the question uh you
asking about the final product when it's
already a bridge
when when are you planning to release it
uh it doesn't depend only on us because
we finish the second stage at the moment
and
there will be another two contests up
front of us it depends
on when the teams will deploy those
contracts
or contests and when we'll be
ready so we the time management
we didn't actually count on it we did we
don't really know it doesn't depend only
on us it depends on on the team
uh on freetown side
yeah but you can take the initiative and
prepare the contest
yourself and just drop for discussions
yes we will definitely do this uh
let um maybe on the next week call we
can answer your question or maybe we
will answer in the telegram a little bit
later
we will have a look i understand the
question we will have a look in it
and we will answer definitely to you
but like guys i'm probably missing
something on the governance side
so this is phase stage two right and
eurozone
only team that develops uh develops uh
the bridge
the polkadot bridge well yes yes
like why do we need a contest can it be
like a partnership proposal given that
it was a discussion on this alexander so
we had it
i guess it was several months ago uh
if i'm not drunk so we had this
discussion with mita also
on this point so when uh he's here yeah
i remember yeah so
yeah it doesn't change it doesn't change
now anything
would it be proposal or contest
absolutely because the timing is the
same it won't give any any progress on
the timing and
it's not fitting in the proposal
description doesn't matter if you have a
contest and even one participant in this
context doesn't change anything
yeah yeah i understand but just just
like from the logic standpoint i mean i
understand first stage one for design i
understand for stage two
like initial implementation but like if
you have one
team left nobody else would come to the
contest and then make a lot of sense
like
well logical we don't know that
we don't know that and there is no way
to to distribute tokens otherwise
proposals
partnerships are not for that and you
know partnerships has a criteria
and the developers development contest
has another criteria
so it could what did it change nothing
but at the same time and i'm okay but
just
doesn't really make a lot of sense from
the logic standpoint
it does because nobody prevents anyone
else to actually participate even in the
stage three we cannot
be certain that no one just sit there
and
develop the whole thing and just rolled
it in the third stage
theoretically it's possible
but anyway uh winter stream so uh
i think that you can give some
estimations uh on as
timing that you need to to deliver the
first the full thing
and uh as you will just lead in
uh this development and uh it is correct
that you're
the only one active team as far as i see
so uh
you can say that okay guys so we're
ready to deliver it within one month
so we can just make it simpler simpler
so and with a much
shorter period so no need to wait uh
one month for each iteration okay yeah
let's start yes we will look into this
and we will do
the estimation on the timing alexander
thank you for the question
and uh of course we will we will post
this information so everyone can see
okay uh mr mcquack please
hello uh i just wanna comment one
comment maybe you can share the link to
the group to your github and so on
um for others because
i think uh yeah
we will prepare the uh all the images
that
necessary to for you to have a look in
the code if i if i understand correctly
your question is uh
when when you have when we can deploy
this or what was the question
just link to your github yes just link
to your github uh
yeah it will be tomorrow it will be
ready by tomorrow and we will share that
in uh
in the chat in the telegram okay thank
you
thank you alexander nice
guys uh how i understand it's finished
uh second stage of implementation
and uh julie start to voting or not
yeah formally uh if i remember it well
so
uh we they need to apply so we all have
applied already
for the second stage of the contest and
uh
the jurors yes i can start voting
facts if i if i think in the right way
um one question more to winter's
team do you have some ready container
where
we can take and do local testing
for understanding that all what we
see now them are working in this way
in the same way and i think we need to
do it yes
like jury uh
alexander yes uh we will just
like the last time we will make sure
that the containers are ready so
and the instruction all the
documentation that necessary to launch
it
we will include that just like the last
time
except that the code inside it is brand
new because we had to rework
many many things uh to make sure the
tokens are transferred correctly
and as soon as it's ready we will do the
submission and of course you will see
the
code just as uh as the last time as
usual yes okay
last time was uh pretty good and was
easy to testing uh your container
and if it will be in the same way it
will be good
thank you alexander thank you thank you
very very much yes we
we are making sure that we it is as
simple as it is possible technically
very good so by the way i just checked
so you have for this left
until the submission so please keep an
eye on the timing
and afterwards jurors will come
commonplace thank you thank you
yes but we will finish and as soon as
it's ready we will post the information
okay okay very good thank you
uh any other opinions guys
three two one no uh all right
uh so um then we move into the
last topic of the today's agenda so it's
more uh
more the topic for discussion and just
to hear
uh different points of view um
it's about the tip three uh token
standard
and uh right what's going on actually so
uh we have uh several teams already
improving uh and upgrading they stock in
sterling because they
uh lack some functionalities
in it like for example for ton bridge
or for dex implementations and
uh there were several requests
to give more uh idea on
on how how this standard should evolve
uh in future and uh yeah so
i wish we will give word to media who
was a developer of this standard so meet
up please
yeah so we just had this exact same
discussion on
uh developer experience of governance
and even voted
so let me just briefly you know
explain what the discussion was
arguments and
conclusion at least from the developer
experience of gov
um i have created a repository i will
share it
in what in in today
which is a tip 3 kind of consortium
and the idea is the following
so um let me explain
so there is a tip three mechanism
as you all know probably which is the
mechanism of how to create a distributed
token
how to verify the code of the token on
the other side how to trade between the
token between the wallet stock and
wallets
individually now transfer meaning now
um we call tip three
this mechanism all the
current proposals relate to
interfaces of t3 token so different
different interfaces and functions to
kind of
extend well the interface and
the idea behind this was
kind of um in process of
how we standardize the
api basically of this token
now we started discussion with brooks's
team on the aba proposals that they had
and there is some proposal
on the forum that listed there and so on
and we were trying like to discuss
of how we can harmonize this api
we also in turn labs are implementing
now distribute this decentralized
exchange
and uh we also kind of
had a you know we needed to change
the api as well and uh and we also
needed to make it so
that it will fit into one message
deploy and when we
kind of collected all of it together we
realized that there is no way to do that
meaning you cannot leave
a creator talking with an interfaces
that will be universally good for
everyone
that's one point another point much
more problematic is that
actually you cannot have a
compatible tip three tokens on the level
of interaction between t3 tokens because
in order to make them compatible you
need to make them binary compatible
which is absolutely unrealistic because
you would not only need to write them in
the same language you would also
need to compile them with the same
compiler all the time
which makes it absolutely no go
so so this leaves us with the following
we have a growing request for changing
in the uh interface level making the
uh compatibility issue
an issue of the size actually of the
of the token and at the same time we
have a situation where we cannot
actually ensure the binary compatibility
of the token
implementation which leads us
to i think the only logical conclusion
that we should not
try to harmonize the interfaces because
it doesn't make any sense
therefore the uh proposal is the for and
okay so let me uh pros and cons
the process okay we don't harmonize that
now because we actually cannot the
cons of that is that now
we have an on-chain compatibility
problem
composability problem and off chain
compatibility problem
now let's discuss two of them the on
chain composibility problem because we
cannot
have the binary compatibility any way we
will have it so when you
have to create an interface for example
a dex
which need to talk to different type
three implementations
because you cannot harmonize them you
will need to probably create some kind
of contracts
that will interface with them and
then work around this issue either you
create a large contract which
which has all the interfaces that you
need implemented there
and has all the codes binary codes of
the
of this of this binary compatible
meaning codes of all this
tip tree that you want to support or you
create some kind of wrappers
around them that one deploy depose
you know make a deposit of one code and
getting another
so there are ways around that the
problem is that
there is no way to to have a different
way
it's just not working um and on the
front end size side the
harmonization of the front end in
freetone
is reached through tibots
mechanism and not through abi
compatibility
uh it's actually way more scalable i
don't want to go into that again
but debot solves this problem where abi
compatibility
does not so in a way you don't have a
problem
if you have a debot on the front end as
long as you
you only need to support the bot
standards which is described in is
consortium
and having you know debot engine or
implement your own debt engine or having
debot engines part of sdk
and you will once you do that you write
your debot the way
you like it to in to interrupt with
whatever tip three tokens you want
and that's how you achieve full uh
compatibility
and uh and you know uh extensibility
to the on the interface level so this
process
serves already uh like a proxy between
uh different interfaces different
implementations
there is no need for any proxy it's uh
and surf is just an example of the
blockchain browser
which supports the bot you can create
your own browser
or add sdbot support in your
wallet and it will immediately support
all the debugs as long as you follow
the debug engine start standards which
described in is consortium
so the idea is to have a
same consortium for tip 3 and say
that we actually like you can add
interfaces as much as you like and the
only rule is
for t3 talking is that the the actual
mechanism of
tip 3 token is the same meaning you
don't change that
and if you want to change that then we
need to talk because this is a security
issue
so you have this mechanism of verifying
the code of the contract code and you
know and and all that stuff
internally and on the external side
maybe
we agree on like one or two interfaces
like transfer for example something like
that which
should be supported anyway and then on
top of that
you can add as much as you want
interfaces and if anyone wants to
support your
tip three api uh in t3 token
it goes to this consortium where you
list all these changes
and and supports them on their own chain
you know smart contract
and we believe that this is the only way
to actually you know have this kind of
standard
um support that and uh there was no
objections on the
no single objection to that on the
developer experience level
but let's i'm ready to you know let's
discuss it if you have any objections
in this sub governance
okay guys please don't don't be shy
raise your hands and ask questions
or you need some time to digest
absolute silence well uh in my opinion
uh
i i share your idea uh that we need some
um
some some uh how to name it someplace
yeah where where we can synchronize on
the
tip three implementations so we're like
you name it consortium
so and uh let me again let me correct
this is not about synchronization
it's not about agreement anyone can
list any interface additional interface
or
change of the interface in this
consortium
just on the purely the only thing
that you need to follow there are two
rules that you need to follow first
don't change the token itself meaning
the mechanism of the token inside
second don't create
like copies so
you if someone already created this kind
of interface
if you want to change it propose a
change but don't
you know uh don't just invent a
field if someone already implement this
interface just follow this interface
do you have some kind of website or some
something like this i already created
repository we'll share it today
okay okay so please drop it to the
default group as well
so uh so that everyone can just go there
and
check uh
all right i think that's more than
enough information and
it's actually answers most of the
questions that appear in
in the forum and chats if someone has
some something to to say guys this is
the right moment please
and no uh all right so
uh mr mr
uh i understand correctly that
midterm means that
[Music]
we don't need many deep
free tokens and contracts
because we have we can
um we don't need to create new
t3 we just can't create
as i think we just can create new
uh who will work with us
no not correct no um
is one part of the story uh for the what
you create for the
front end uh compatibility
for the internal compatibility between
tip3 tokens it cannot be achieved
and therefore it doesn't make any sense
to standardize
the uh the interfaces so the abi
of the debot if you want in the external
methods
or internal methods you can create as
much as you want
if you want someone else to be able to
be compatible with your talk and you
just list that in this consortium
repository add that there and that's it
you don't need to ask anyone else to do
that
yes i understand this yes yes
thank you
good yes
i like in this story our tokens are
considered standard without
modifications
it's good we get capability with
values through the bot which is ready
but um
i'm not sure if this can be considered
standard and
i don't like is that everyone
you have to embed a devote engine
everywhere
it's my opinion
well the bot is a standard so jibot has
a consortium which works on the standard
it's a way as i explained in in direct
sub governance
the debug standard is exactly like html
standard works
you have a browser anyone can create a
browser you have an html which has a
standards which if you want to support
on the browser level you support that
any developer which wants to create an
html
which which is compatible with you know
with the standard
creates the html which compatible with
the standards and if the browser
supports that
you will have your html works in that
browser immediately
that's the way web operated i don't
think we need to change that
and i don't think it's a failed model i
think this model proved
itself very good um
it's just impossible to create
compatibility on abi level we just
discussed that so i don't think there is
also not only that is good there is also
no other way
to do that so again you can
create a you can be compatible with
any abi on
the tip three if you just implement it
manually
on the tip three consortium level so you
have tip three there are listed
you know interfaces there you can take
these interfaces and implement them
you know one by one in your wallet
instead of implementing the debug engine
uh it is is it a good way to do that
i don't think so but it's up to you it's
up to the wallet developer and they want
to do it this way
which is uh you know in ethereum proof
that's
absolutely you know not
not good we can see that it's a failed
model
but if you want to follow that you have
this choice so
we kind of have all of the choices you
want right
and uh you know if you also
like if you don't like then propose it
because
again as i said even if we create this
universal standard of apis
we will not be able to create a
compatibility
of the debugs on their own chain anyway
so like i don't see why it shouldn't
work
i'm afraid that many of you start
support without the boats typically
for several lobby yes sure
do it
okay i can answer this
you you can like in the text you just
you just go to the consortium of tip
three and you just support all the tip
three
uh that t3s that list that
implementation that listed there
um you cannot
uh if there is a way to check
compatibility
by code by binary code you you you can
do that so
any code any tip three that follows
a particular you know as a particular
binary and and the interface standards
combined com you know compiled with a
similar
same com compiler
basically having the same binary code
will be working with your decks
but if you have a new token coming you
will need to support that token
meaning that if you have a token which
is even the same token but just com
compiled with the latest version um
you will still need to add that into
your into your decks
and there is simply no way around that
but i would say it's an improvement over
what you have now
um in other chains
but it's not you know ideal
well because there is no ideal in the
world i guess
as always a compromise
well what we're doing with our decks
just to add to that
is that we uh create a wrapper
and uh talk an internal token for the
decks
and you always can rap like
you can you can
you can create a like a wrapper factory
which if the wrapper is wrapping into
new
your dex token then it will be
automatically supported so if i have a
talk and a tip tree token
which i for some reason has you know
interface changed or
binary code changed then i just need to
create a wrapper for your dex and it
will work immediately so you don't
you actually can't create this automatic
way to automatically add tokens there is
no problem with that
i think is it worth to mention videos
that you mentioned on the works called
that
there is a tip another tip in progress
like maybe you
can introduce
oh you mean for the debot address
discovery right
yeah well but it's not related but it
may be related to the
to your yeah well it allows it allows it
allows the
given like project to automate the like
uh design wants to add
yes user wants to add some token he just
like proposed this uh
name of the token and everything well
the question was about the dex that if
you want to
talk about the interface yeah then there
will be a way
to automate the discovery of the um
of the debot from the address of the
contract so you
you have an address you can calculate
the address of the debot
to this contract actually to 2d bots one
debate will be discovered based on the
hash code
of your contract so like any contract
with the same hash code
maybe may have just an address of the
debot
discoverable on the on the client side
and also the debug which based on just
this particular address
so this particular address discoverable
debug i mean it's quite easy to
to realize that of course so you have
you have two ways to you have
you have a way to discover the general
debate for the code
of the contract for all the contracts
deployed
same contracts deployed and then also
the bot for this particular your
particular contracts
and you just operate the way you want
with this
good that sounds very interesting
uh yeah i really want to say something
no uh okay guys thank you media for this
very sophisticated and interesting
discussion so uh
still if you if any one of those who
will listen to this or read to this
so if you have any questions so don't
hesitate to just uh
leave your comments in the defy group
mention media
or maybe on the forum is a bad choice
and
yeah so i think this is pretty pretty
clear now
so how to act with c3 tokens
uh so that's pretty it for today's
agenda
so uh if you have any open topics for
discussion so please
now the open scene time
just raise your hands please
three two one
thank you everyone so see you same time
next week
and have a nice weekend bye-bye
goodbye
