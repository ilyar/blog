all right there we go youtube started um
and since meech is going to go first
anyway so okay let me um so not to waste
time let me start
uh yes
welcome everybody to everscale community
call number 100
100.
yeah hooray um congratulations to
everybody it's uh
it's been
just a absolute pleasure to host these
calls for as long as i have and it's
it's you know it's an honor every week
it's an honor uh and just shy of our two
year anniversary which is coming up
which we're going to hear about in just
a in just a few minutes um
we only have a couple of presentations
today and then i have two quick
announcements that i want to make um so
we're going to keep it sort of light and
fun today
uh first just the regular uh call
tidbits uh please turn your cameras on
and please uh save your questions until
each presenter is finished with their
presentation and use the raise your hand
feature in zoom to do so if you're
watching us on youtube please leave your
questions in the comment section we'll
get to them at the very end of the call
and of course the call is always
conducted in english so like i said i
had a couple things i wanted to say but
uh word of warning to everybody nita is
only going to be with us for a few
minutes today he's got a run so i'm
gonna let him start right away with
technical updates and if you have
questions that he can't answer on the
call uh just write them in the chats and
i'm sure uh you'll get your answers
there so nita if you would kick things
off
hi um okay so we'll be quick we have
started to introduce a new version uh of
the node to the blockchain this is the
update that i were talking about
uh last time
and uh
this includes the
the
kind of fix for
corrupted
um
state
which we currently have on the main net
as well it's not a particular problem
because um
[Music]
well because
it's it's it's red it's like very hard
hard to reach that corrupted state part
and
and and because we fixed it so
so it has been tested on the devnet
together with that
um this new version is introducing
compression
um and uh just by virtue of upgrading to
this new version we don't need to turn
that on it will turn on automatically
when
it's just the network the more nodes we
introduce basically then the network
will
start
slowly migrate into a compression
traffic version
um so you can see that there is about
eight percent of the network already
like at seven percent of the network
already in
running this note we're slowly slowly
upgrading that
now
um we cannot upgrade we cannot just
release the upgrades because um
this fix it goes to the whole depth of
all the
all the cells in the
in the state
and in order to do that the network may
stop for about 40 minutes in some
to just to kind of
copy everything it needs
uh and therefore if we just introduce it
and everyone will upgrade it once the
network will stop for some time which we
don't want to do
for that
the upgrade will be slowly introduced to
different validators i will write you
guys so someone will write your gym will
write you and ask you to upgrade the
node and you will upgrade the node and
then we will go and so on and so forth
so we will just reach out until we kind
of upgrading
something like uh you know 70 percent of
the network
like that and we will release the
that the general upgrade so
um
[Music]
again it's it's um
rarely happens but
but that's that's the only way really to
do that
and um yeah we'll just do that by the
end of this procedure the network will
run
the version
which which has
almost everything we wanted on this
stage before we move to
next kind of
updates on the roadmap including
decreasing the gas
and and introducing ramp
but before we can do that we need to
go for this stage and introduce these
fixes move to
certain
things and did
[Music]
upgrades and so on and so forth so uh
um so yeah so
[Music]
that that that process started and that
will take some time but i hope by the
end of by then by next week
the majority of the network will run
this upgrade and the network will be
upgraded and we can move to the next
things
that's basically all from me
okay thank you me too very much uh if
anybody has questions for me to uh ask
them now or hold your piece until the
chats because media has to jump off the
call does anybody have a question raise
your hand if you do
nope okay thank you guys see you next
time
yep see you next week
okay duke um so now uh i have a couple
announcements to make uh so the first
one is the
two proposals for growth phase three
that we talked about last week
were taken to a vote to ever doubt and
they passed
which means
that we're going to be preparing
proposals for initial members and for
partners
and taking those to a vote based on
evaluation so
like i mentioned in last tuesday's call
we're going to be doing this in batches
because uh well frankly just because
there's just so many
that we can't we can't do it all at once
uh so we're preparing the first batch as
we speak
uh that should
be able okay so fingers crossed uh
hopefully the first batch will go to a
vote uh this week
and then from there every week
thereafter for you know give or take
about a month
and we should get through it uh which
would be which would be great so
uh for initial members right um i
encourage you to please uh dm me direct
message me
with a summary of everything that you've
done throughout your tenure uh on
everscale forever scale uh and uh if
possible uh try to keep it to one page
uh like in a you know it doesn't even
have to be a google doc you could just
dm me and um and telegram at ron milo uh
but uh if it must be two pages let's
keep that the maximum because uh when it
comes to proposals
we really don't want to deal with like a
giant monstrosity of a document the way
i would probably do description links
description links description links
simple as that
uh if you are a partner
then
your uh proposal is going to be based on
links to the forum where your original
proposal was
because that's where your entire history
is that's where all the communications
happened
and
basically
if
you do want to add something before we
take whatever you have on the forum as a
proposal to a vote
i encourage you to do that today
like as soon as humanly possible uh so
if you just go to where your original
proposal is scroll all the way down to
the very end hit the blue reply button
in the forum and just you know just say
you know what you've done um you know
what you know and provide evidence
obviously that it's not just about uh
saying it it's about proving it so links
are definitely a prerequisite
and uh yeah
if you have any questions again just dm
me and i'll you know try to get back to
you as soon as i possibly can
um so that's it for uh announcement
number one
announcement number two
um
i'm a little sad to say
uh but uh this is going to be the last
week that i host
uh the weekly community call and it's
fitting that it's symbolic that it's
exactly at 100.
uh i'm going to be passing the torch to
some very excellent folks we know quite
well to ben
and to joanne who are going to i don't
know either co-host or maybe one
does one week one does it anyway
they'll decide how they do it uh and
believe me i am not going anywhere this
is my home
uh i simply have uh several projects
that i'm deeply involved in right now
including one that i just took on and i
have to focus a hundred percent of my
time on that uh so it's not that i want
to leave
it's that i have to right um but again
just from hosting the call and of course
if they ever invite me back to guest
host i'd be happy to do it and maybe uh
once the projects that i'm talking about
but not mentioning right now uh actually
become what they're supposed to be then
i'll come back not as a host but as a
presenter which would be an honor for me
and it's been an honor for me to do this
i've had so so much fun but uh right now
i need to focus on what i do best which
is uh the business side of things not
necessarily the community management
side of things so thank you all so so
much for allowing me to do this it's
been a pleasure
um and uh joanne ben you guys are going
to be up next week so
it's up to you now
so
yeah
so i love everyone just so that you know
we love you oh i love you guys hey again
um i'm just moving from one room to
another room staying in the same house
i'm never going anywhere you're always
welcome back you're always welcome back
thank you so much
it's a big word
sure
um you know you couldn't beat me with a
stick to get out of every scale it's
what i love
um
anyway uh let's get to presentations uh
up next we have uh let's see is vlad
with us what are you there yes
excellent so vlad is going to talk to us
about the vlogger bounty program uh it
was posted in the chats if you've seen
it
uh great if you have it you're about to
learn about it
uh but basically if you're
uh
somebody who's good with vlogging
vlogging smogging clogging whatever
uh
if you're good with youtube social media
you can earn some tokens so vlad why
don't you tell everybody about it
yeah i guess
uh thank you ron for for being so for
this two wonderful years of running this
community course
you're doing this really great and uh so
i hope that you know we're not missing
you at all
so and
i'm really
curious to see what projects we are
doing and
what we will come with
so
yeah about uh
the blogger campaign so um a few things
to be named first uh
this specific bounty campaign is just
uh a minor thing uh of uh much bigger
process that we are currently uh running
so
running for some
some time already so uh you all know
that we
are always struggling to to market uh at
the scale uh and it's a product on level
skills and since maybe uh several months
uh in defile and so
we
are applying some enormous efforts to to
change this trend and
make
everything much
widespread and
widely acknowledged
and
in doing this so you see a lot of
twitter mentions about telescale as a
red free army performing like hell and
by the way if you are not
in there yet so please subscribe to
wordpress army i definitely recommend
you
and
uh so and also
some specific products like broadcast
products that we uh are doing so we also
apply some marketing efforts to uh
attract more more more uh community more
liquidity
and uh through october's bridge to to
make the network uh more
popular in general
so and uh in doing this so
we decided to start forming the
big
funds so that will be
devoted
to
boosting the ecosystem
of
first of all of our products and
of ever skill
so uh and this font was announced by
sergey recently
so and
it's now formed of cube tokens and
bridge tokens which uh well cost
something
at least in the market and a lot of
people are really allowing them
but we also
will
attract the additional partners who will
increase this fund and uh
help us boost the whole eventual
ecosystem
and as a first step in doing this so we
allocated a certain amount of money so
this is quite a decent amount of money
uh to uh vlogging or video blogging
campaign uh or conquista i don't know
how to say it better so we want to make
uh
a small feature small but very important
feature of the orchestra's bridge
reviewed by as many people as possible
around the world so we are targeting for
your understanding so at least 100
videos
in different countries
so in different languages
that we can later use to
popularize and educate
new common people and explain this to
partners and to project and uh all these
kind of stakeholders
and uh to do this so we're located
if i remember it correctly so it's
something like 10 000 bridge tokens for
uh as a direct bounty for uh for
bloggers and also 1000 bridge tokens as
a referral reward for those who will get
those bloggers
done
uh
they their job
and
we will assess each video uh that
will be submitted to us just on the
scales so from zero to one hundred so um
millions at one hundred is the best
videos and uh those uh who make the best
videos they first of all they will get
the maximum
reward so if i remember 12 sums like 100
uh
bridge tokens per video
and uh also for a selected one so we
will
we are considering just making some more
longer contracts on promoting our video
our functionality and our products and
especially uh not only for broadcast
products but also for everscale
in general because uh through this
campaign we will also
make a wider filtering of uh
which producers
of this video content perform better and
who have the better community and uh
reach the higher uh performance
uh so and in this way we are really
willing to break the trend and
make the self-sustaining uh marketing of
our schedule so that's
just pretty
compliments clear
yeah it is it is
and the bridge tokens are up by the way
is that it
yep okay vlad thank you very much who
has a question if you do raise your
hand we do have a thumbs up and that's
excellent yeah very very cool excellent
i wish i was a vlogger
maybe this is your secret project no no
unfortunately it's not but uh you know
maybe one day maybe when i'm like 65 or
something and i retire
who's going to watch me anyway thank you
very much vlad um all right let's go to
our next presentation uh so
i mentioned uh
last week that this year's anniversary
party on may 7th which happens to fall
on a saturday by the way so there's no
excuse not to come
uh is going to be done in an ever scale
metaverse
if you remember a couple maybe a few
weeks ago we had a guest presentation
from daydar
who showed us kind of a rough design of
what that might look like now it's nice
and polished it's actually beautiful the
work done is
really amazing and i know joanne
contributed quite a bit to that with
ideas and everything else i'm in the
chat looks great but
i want everybody
everybody to be at this metaverse
anniversary party uh but to do that
you're gonna need some instructions and
know exactly what you need to do so we
have the sort of how where
uh what and when uh presentation for
that so i guess i don't know uh who
wants to start joanne or dadar
i'll do a bit of an intro and then
yeah however data wants to pick it up
from there maybe you want to show
something
that's cool
um but thank you for the introduction
and yes the party's coming up very very
soon and everybody has to join and it's
very very simple to join so you have no
excuse
we all know you have a computer so
you're going to be there
anyway
so um just a few days away
or a couple weeks whatever uh it takes
place in the mona metaverse which is
really awesome and it's very intuitive
which is great
um
the bit of a point point to make out
there is that every scale is not yet
integrated with mona for the time being
so right now it's f-based but we can
very easily temporarily bridge you know
some things by linking content within
the metaverse to another platform so for
example if uh you want to claim some
ever nfts um we can link them inside the
metaverse and you click on it and it
drives you outside to maybe grand bazaar
for example
and uh the link to joining the actual
event will be shared the day of before
the party starts
and a tip is to use chrome because there
has been a lot of issues with uh safari
users i'm pretty sure it only supports
chrome based so
keep that in mind and sorry for those
who are safari
fanboys or girls
um the event will be free to join of
course there's no wallet initialization
fee
you don't have to buy a bottle to sit on
a table or anything like that
it's very simple and you can literally
just jump in you click the link and you
can jump in um the interface will be
very familiar for people who have you
know grown up playing quake
doom wolfenstein unreal and games like
that they don't use the id software they
use uh mona uses unity game engine but
if you play those games then it's gonna
feel like like home just jumping right
in um after you click and enter you can
basically just walk around and start
exploring with the keys or the wasd keys
spaces jump and shift is run and it's
really easy to figure out there's a few
little buttons down below where you can
just click one of them and design your
avatar
it's stored once you make it so you
could just exit it
you don't have to save anything it's all
super intuitive and easy um
maybe maybe this is one of the things
that data can show off if you want to
like
design your own avatar
um
and i'm pretty sure that i could just
make like a really quick walk-through
document right before
um
yeah that would be great
right right before you know click on
this this is but really if you just go
to mona dot gallery you could just start
out and
you're in it you pick a space and you
could just be in it it takes a bit to
load but once it's there you're in and
uh you know if you played those games
from back in the day
it's really just
you know like the back of your hand type
of thing
and i'm also say uh yeah i also wanted
to say um we'll have some appearances by
some notable community members of the
everscale ecosystem to talk about some
things we'll have some nft giveaways
somebody had already asked about beer
and yeah we're gonna give it
and there's gonna be some music and
dancing and if you want to promote your
project like if you're if you're doing
something in every scale and maybe you
want to show off something that you've
made or you want to talk about a project
then just
ping me and we can talk about how you
can get involved with it maybe you can
have your own like booth or a space or
or
some asset like we have a dj table and
things like that maybe you want to add
something else and showcase some of your
stuff
we could talk about it
um
yeah and
i am of course
very confident to say that the space
looks awesome like it's better than i
could have imagined dater did
a magnificent job with it and um full
credit to him on that for sure
he's the metaverse guru here and um
yeah i'm really excited for everybody to
experience this space that he created
hands down it's the best so he's also on
the call right now he's the funky
looking dude he looks way cooler than
all of us
and if he wants to say anything then
it's all yours theater if you want to
jump in
hi hi there
uh so let's jump into it directly um
can you see yeah nice so now you can see
i'm in the space
uh and you can join it i just uh dropped
the link into the
um
the zoom
and uh you can join me in this way and
it will be a little bit laggy because i
have zoom i have uh
um obs and uh this kind of stuff so
please don't take it too
um
too hard so um yeah when you come here
to here you can see my second avatar who
here who will explain you what is uh
what is going on
i have some issues with the yeah
nope
yeah there we go
so i can i can place any anybody in this
uh in this place it can be joe it can be
bad a
alexander so anyone i can i can replace
this avatar by
however you want oh hi there
so i don't know who is this um
but he can you can join me and
explore all that
that world with me uh
about the music it's a little bit uh
difficult to make uh the metaverse with
a good sound and without interference uh
when we speak so uh for now um we can
join the same music by taking those uh
um headphones and uh just click to the
link and uh it can be any uh any of uh
music uh so you you we will um
we will choose the the music for us uh
i think uh with all the community uh but
for now i just uh
made a house music launcher
i just linked it a house music launch
for now
uh so
there
there is some canvas i can place this
way anything you want uh
even if you want a second metaverse for
your business or uh or these those
things i can't join i can link your
other metaphors to this uh
to this door or
this one
so there will be just three three
different
doors
and
this way the same thing
it can be a portrait of the of
of ever scale
and when we come to here uh we have yeah
we have some avatars who's dancing uh
there are just a few of them uh but i uh
i recommend you to to make your own
avatar and uh
and you can integrate it
right here and even make uh
make them interactive so there is uh
i think you guessed her
with this
um
he looks like a little yeah
i think he will recognize the the
the
the the person
and so yeah yeah you can just uh
look at all the
all this stuff i i i hope it's not too
much um
glowy uh i guess i have another avatar
here he's not alterative actually but uh
yeah if you have any uh
any idea what i can
integrate here as i'm on your uh
i i i will integrate you eat
whenever you want a
barman this way ah even
if we we talk about the champagne so i
made a little um
artifact here is not yeah so this
champagne is right here yeah i i did not
uh
write uh many think about that so
there there's still some uh work to do
but uh i guess we have the the most part
the the biggest work is already done
so i guess it's just
up to you to to join and see how it
works and
propose
whatever you like
yeah it looks great it's perfect thank
you i don't think it's too glowy or
anything like that i think it's spot on
you did a great job
yeah it's really cool i have an issue
with my headphones so i did not hear
anything um
said it's really cool
we said it's really cool and it's not
too bright or glowy as you said it it's
cool it's really cool
ah damn it
uh
okay
yes yes i i can hear you finally sorry i
have so many uh application that's
running in the same time so i have also
some issue with my headphones uh so i i
did not uh heard
what did you say so can you repeat
please yeah i just said it's really cool
yeah it's good it's great yeah
absolutely
okay thanks
um so so i have a so um uh uh joanne you
said so uh chrome browser but we can use
like brave which is yeah right okay
right
um yeah just uh maybe yeah just like a
one pager of instructions uh just like
you know especially like i'm not a gamer
yeah i don't know
i don't know which partners do what uh
there are some buttons that you can use
like for example running because you
walk around it's really slow but you can
also run but it's not
shown in the in the ui so that's
something that would i would definitely
need to pick out and show you
like it has to be a visual guide yeah
yeah something like that yeah exactly so
just and then of course i would
encourage everybody to go to and i
dropped the link that uh uh that they
are put in which is uh
uh
yeah um
that's a long link it's in youtube and
it's in the zoom chat and go there and
and do that and i'm gonna do it and
do it this week so you can sort of you
know so you're not awkward you know uh
so so when you first come to the party
you're not gonna be the guy that's like
trying to figure everything out like
figure out everything
figure it out ahead of time uh michael
uh you have a question please
yeah hi everyone
um how are you man sorry i just i'm
doing well i just i'm wondering if you
have the
land uh economics and
and if you
um
have
gone to market yet with
for investors to buy land and people to
build on
on the land and stuff
well it's a bit different because we
don't own we didn't build mona we're
using their space and we've created a
space on mona this is um
it's not our
metaverse we've designed our own
metaverse on top of mona so it's not
something to bring to investors or uh
buy and sell land or anything like that
but we can utilize it we can promote
things within it within the space like
after we have our party we can redesign
some things and showcase
every scale
episode community projects or products
or anything like that
um
but i i don't imagine us buying and
selling land within this
if you want the mona is like a wordpress
bar for the meta versus and we can sell
and buy uh meta versus uh on the open c
uh
and those uh the spaces are sell by uh
uh by mona but is owned by an artist so
uh in uh
in theory i can mint this space actually
is not minted once it's minted i cannot
change any uh artifacts uh
um
besides uh the canvas the canvas i can i
can change whenever i want but once it's
minted i can sell it and uh this uh but
it's that's not it not mean that um
the space is owned and managed by the
the person
it's owned by the person who bought that
that space but it still can be managed
only by the person who
who
who built that so i think it will be uh
fix it soon uh because i think it's
just normal when you buy a space you can
manage it
um
you you will be able to manage it by
yourself
sounds good
oh
anybody help else have a question
no
thank you mike thank you dadar thank you
joanne uh
um
in case you don't know uh there's also
another conference that's going on uh

wider audience at the minute a really
really cool guy as well having a few
conversations with him

ones oh sorry on the note of flat cube

too much yes i do i speculate a lot and
but i heard a rumor maybe that there is
was was is up to 48
abr aby available on a stable going pair

so those of you are into you can define
i mean i don't need to tell you what how
awesome that is
uh trade view um i i know our friend
roman had a little hand in getting this
set up there's a really cool uh
competition going on over on trade view
uh you don't have to pay anything to
enter basically if you're familiar with
trade view you go on there you put your
price predictions your charts you know
kind of speculation your ta and stuff
and essentially if you speculate on it's
either
uh everscale solana luna and a couple of
others
um and you get closest to the prediction
by may the seventh hey who the thoughts
today may the seventh there's a lot
going on that day
um but yeah you get closest to the
prediction and you'll win a prize
brilliant
and final one uh this only just went out
in the news channels but but this is a
lot of fun uh sparta cats hey what's
going on there um king meowdis he seems
an interesting character
and i've seen a couple of things going
on behind the scenes alex doing a cheeky
little grin there i can see you uh yeah
you're intrigued by this one too um but
yeah they're doing some very very
interesting things it's definitely
different so that that's going to be
very cool keep an eye on that one
um i think off the top that's all my
notes for today guys so if i've missed
anything apologies i will try and
include it next week if it doesn't crop
up before then thank you very much thank
you ben that was excellent wonderful
thank you all
snappy snappy
never do that
i'm a i'm a bore um
we have a question for dadar uh and
joanne uh from crypto cryptstar crypto
uh
uh how can we reserve a vip table at the
metaverse party
uh reserve uh for now we um we can't uh
but i think uh the
the ability to sit down at a table will
be come soon
uh by i guess uh reserve you can maybe
buy an nfc and uh after that that nfc
can
uh can make you
be able to see it maybe i don't know i
think it will be possible but for now
it's not
there's your answer but that would be
cool like i get a vip table or something
like that like i have some sort of a
sponsorship program that would be a
very good idea yeah i forgot to say
about uh
the feedbacks and new features i just
dropped another link to the zoom um you
can submit uh your feedback to mona and
uh the most liked
feature will be developed
at the at first
time i think uh in uh it's called mona
dot
uh
koni no sorry i i i can't eat that
yeah
yeah right so i think the whole
community of everscale can just uh come
to come to it and ask for integrating
every scale maybe it will be integrated
faster
i'm pretty sure we do have some people
working on integration um i think
constantine is heading that up
but um
yeah i think if we have
more demand then we might get
higher up on that to-do list their
developers are pretty stretched right
now too moon aside yep
okay
thank you
very very much everybody uh
i guess uh that's
all i see in terms of youtube questions
right now and if we don't have any more
i actually think now is the record and
we just said it 43 minutes on the call
uh listen i love everybody so much thank
you guys so much for allowing me to do
this it's been an
honor a privilege uh and yeah again just
let's keep let's make sure we we're
clear on this i'm not going anywhere
you're just not gonna see my ugly mug
every week that's about it
um
thank you uh
