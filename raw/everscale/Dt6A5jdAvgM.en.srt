00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
from the network were engaged into those
 

67
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,749
from the network were engaged into those
discussions as well but again it's it's

00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
framework and then each of the five
 

77
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,190
framework and then each of the five
pieces will be put for the vote

78
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,200
pieces will be put for the vote
 

79

okay so
the kind of the philosophical part is

86
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
the kind of the philosophical part is
 

87
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,670
the kind of the philosophical part is
that as well remember two years ago we

88
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
that as well remember two years ago we
 

89
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,109
that as well remember two years ago we
launched with a very experimental

90
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:41,119
launched with a very experimental
 

91
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,710
launched with a very experimental
innovative model

92
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
innovative model
 

93
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,030
innovative model
which assumed kind of ultimate

94
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,040
which assumed kind of ultimate
 

95
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,710
which assumed kind of ultimate
decentralization

96
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
decentralization
 

97
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,469
decentralization
where everybody could put up a proposal

98
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:48,479
where everybody could put up a proposal
 

99
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,710
where everybody could put up a proposal
for a contest or a partnership and it

100
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
for a contest or a partnership and it
 

101
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,190
for a contest or a partnership and it
was voted and executed and it of course

102
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
was voted and executed and it of course
 

103
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,429
was voted and executed and it of course
sounded great in theory but in practice

104
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
sounded great in theory but in practice
 

105
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,190
sounded great in theory but in practice
what we got is that

106
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
what we got is that
 

107
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,789
what we got is that
there were a lot of teams that were

108
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
there were a lot of teams that were
 

109
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,910
there were a lot of teams that were
basically

110
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
basically
 

111
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,550
basically
let's say hunting for tokens rather than

112
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
let's say hunting for tokens rather than
 

113
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,510
let's say hunting for tokens rather than
really looking forward to the

114
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
really looking forward to the
 

115
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,590
really looking forward to the
contribution so a lot of contests and

116
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
contribution so a lot of contests and
 

117
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,869
contribution so a lot of contests and
partnerships basically became uh again a

118
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
partnerships basically became uh again a
 

119
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,750
partnerships basically became uh again a
hunt for for tokens with no

120
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
hunt for for tokens with no
 

121
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,550
hunt for for tokens with no
obvious value to the network

122
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
obvious value to the network
 

123
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,390
obvious value to the network
at some point on parallel there have

124
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
at some point on parallel there have
 

125
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,869
at some point on parallel there have
been people who were buying tokens

126
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
been people who were buying tokens
 

127
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,190
been people who were buying tokens
investing you know into the tokens and

128
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
investing you know into the tokens and
 

129
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,229
investing you know into the tokens and
at some point they were getting

130
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
at some point they were getting
 

131
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,990
at some point they were getting
frustrated with that the teams were

132
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
frustrated with that the teams were
 

133
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,869
frustrated with that the teams were
getting tokens for no no obvious

134
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
getting tokens for no no obvious
 

135
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,150
getting tokens for no no obvious
value-add

136
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
value-add
 

137
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,670
value-add
we're eventually kind of dumping them on

138
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680
we're eventually kind of dumping them on
 

139
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,430
we're eventually kind of dumping them on
the market and then we saw continuous

140
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440
the market and then we saw continuous
 

141
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,110
the market and then we saw continuous
decrease on the price

142
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120
decrease on the price
 

143
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,790
decrease on the price
so at that point in time about a year

144
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
so at that point in time about a year
 

145
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,190
so at that point in time about a year
ago there was an initiative from

146
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
ago there was an initiative from
 

147
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,509
ago there was an initiative from
the other gentleman on the call

148
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
the other gentleman on the call
 

149
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,150
the other gentleman on the call
sir again sergey and then of course the

150
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160
sir again sergey and then of course the
 

151
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,790
sir again sergey and then of course the
other team members of the defined lines

152
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:44,800
other team members of the defined lines
 

153
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,710
other team members of the defined lines
that the fire line should be created to

154
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
that the fire line should be created to
 

155
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,270
that the fire line should be created to
essentially represent the interest of

156
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
essentially represent the interest of
 

157
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,550
essentially represent the interest of
the investors

158
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
the investors
 

159
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,470
the investors
and that's how the initiative came

160
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
and that's how the initiative came
 

161
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,750
and that's how the initiative came
through and

162
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
through and
 

163
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,589
through and
the fire alliance got the location of

164
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:55,599
the fire alliance got the location of
 

165
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,229
the fire alliance got the location of
tokens and we saw some some good results

166
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
tokens and we saw some some good results
 

167
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,710
tokens and we saw some some good results
coming in we saw inflow of liquidity we

168
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
coming in we saw inflow of liquidity we
 

169
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,270
coming in we saw inflow of liquidity we
saw a number of great listings you know

170
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280

 

171
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,830

522
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,480
tracks better the ratings
 

523
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,870
tracks better the ratings
of uh several blockchains

524
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,880
of uh several blockchains
 

525
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,509
of uh several blockchains
and uh we think that will be fair both

526
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
and uh we think that will be fair both
 

527
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,070
and uh we think that will be fair both
for investors and for core contributors

528
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
for investors and for core contributors
 

529
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,829
for investors and for core contributors
and will support motivation

we would also have to be there for a

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,200
we would also have to be there for a
 

557
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,350
we would also have to be there for a
particular amount of time

558

particular amount of time
 

559
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,310
particular amount of time
uh once uh the call proposal will be

560
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
uh once uh the call proposal will be
 

561
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,509
uh once uh the call proposal will be
approved by tawa uh we will formulate

562
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:41,519
approved by tawa uh we will formulate
 

563
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,949
approved by tawa uh we will formulate
the exact figures and timing uh

564
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:44,959
the exact figures and timing uh
 

565
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,269
the exact figures and timing uh
for that formula and hope that dao will

566
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
for that formula and hope that dao will
 

567
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,269
for that formula and hope that dao will
support

568
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
support
 

569
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,829
support
this

570
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:51,839

 

571
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,030

definitive formula as well

572
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040

 

573
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,710

just couple just a couple of thoughts

574
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
just couple just a couple of thoughts
 

575
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,190
just couple just a couple of thoughts
from me on this one so the idea is that

576
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
from me on this one so the idea is that
 

577
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,630
from me on this one so the idea is that
instead of automatically getting the

578
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
instead of automatically getting the
 

579
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,910
instead of automatically getting the
westerns that's talking about evrx or

580
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:05,920
westerns that's talking about evrx or
 

581
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,590
westerns that's talking about evrx or
defy alliance continue to get uh to get

582
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
defy alliance continue to get uh to get
 

583
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,150
defy alliance continue to get uh to get
tokens against cd5 lines programs

584
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
tokens against cd5 lines programs
 

585
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,030
tokens against cd5 lines programs
that the new tokens would be vested

586
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
that the new tokens would be vested
 

587
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,430
that the new tokens would be vested
only upon entry in top 100 and then

588
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
only upon entry in top 100 and then
 

589
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,829
only upon entry in top 100 and then
advancing towards top 10 gradually

590
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
advancing towards top 10 gradually
 

591
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,509
advancing towards top 10 gradually
and basically what it means is that the

592
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
and basically what it means is that the
 

593
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,870
and basically what it means is that the
whole

594
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
whole
 

595
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,710
whole
all the teams in the alliance and everex

596
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
all the teams in the alliance and everex
 

597
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,710
all the teams in the alliance and everex
would be sitting in one boat and rowing

598
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
would be sitting in one boat and rowing
 

599
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,710
would be sitting in one boat and rowing
in the same direction uh you know

600
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
in the same direction uh you know
 

601
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,509
in the same direction uh you know
towards the top country uh which which

602
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
towards the top country uh which which
 

603
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,470
towards the top country uh which which
also

604
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
also
 

605
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,470
also
it's it's important to understand that

606
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
it's it's important to understand that
 

607
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,310
it's it's important to understand that
if and when and i personally have no

608
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
if and when and i personally have no
 

609
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,590
if and when and i personally have no
doubts that we enter top 100 and advance

610
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
doubts that we enter top 100 and advance
 

611
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,430
doubts that we enter top 100 and advance
in the ranking it obviously means that

612
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
in the ranking it obviously means that
 

613
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,550
in the ranking it obviously means that
there will be much higher trading

614
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
there will be much higher trading
 

615
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,790
there will be much higher trading
volumes so there would be more liquidity

616
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
volumes so there would be more liquidity
 

617
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,190
volumes so there would be more liquidity
in the market and once tokens those

618
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
in the market and once tokens those
 

619
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,949
in the market and once tokens those
tokens would be vested they would could

620
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
tokens would be vested they would could
 

621
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,150
tokens would be vested they would could
not put

622
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
not put
 

623
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,509
not put
basically a lot of pressure on the

624
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
basically a lot of pressure on the
 

625
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,670
basically a lot of pressure on the
market because again we would be facing

626
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
market because again we would be facing
 

627
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,269
market because again we would be facing
total different levels of trading

628
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
total different levels of trading
 

629
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,550
total different levels of trading

volumes
 

631
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,389
volumes
so that's two cents for me i know if

632
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
so that's two cents for me i know if
 

633
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,470
so that's two cents for me i know if

it's
 

643
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,590
it's
one of the best solution current

644
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
one of the best solution current
 

645
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,629
one of the best solution current
situation uh first of all we will be

then team leader team leads uh have a
 

875
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,069
then team leader team leads uh have a
meeting and in some rare cases they ask

876
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
meeting and in some rare cases they ask
 

877
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,470
meeting and in some rare cases they ask
some other

878
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:58,480
some other
 

879
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,150
some other
members of rx to support to resolve some

880
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
members of rx to support to resolve some
 

881
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,750
members of rx to support to resolve some
conflicting resources but that

882
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,760
conflicting resources but that
 

883
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,429
conflicting resources but that
approach works well we see the results

884
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
approach works well we see the results
 

885
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,549
approach works well we see the results
we see

886
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
we see
 

887

paul mentioned starting from july

902
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:29,520
paul mentioned starting from july
 

903
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,549
paul mentioned starting from july
from now

904
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:30,559
from now
 

905
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,310
from now
core development will be covered by

906
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,320
core development will be covered by
 

907
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,549
core development will be covered by
their scale foundation and new companies

908
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
their scale foundation and new companies
 

909
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,870
their scale foundation and new companies
will be able to also participate

910
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
will be able to also participate
 

911
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,549
will be able to also participate
in core development so it's not just

912
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:38,559
in core development so it's not just
 

913
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,390
in core development so it's not just
never ex you know pushing the network

914
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:40,400
never ex you know pushing the network
 

915
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,909
never ex you know pushing the network
forward on the core

916
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
forward on the core
 

917
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,350
forward on the core
uh and we know there are teams on the

918
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
uh and we know there are teams on the
 

919
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,830
uh and we know there are teams on the
network who can actually do that

920
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:45,840
network who can actually do that
 

921
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,310
network who can actually do that
and of course as because the financing

922
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
and of course as because the financing
 

923
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,390
and of course as because the financing
would come from the foundation

924
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400
would come from the foundation
 

925
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,909
would come from the foundation
uh it will have to be strictly open

926
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
uh it will have to be strictly open
 

927
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:52,870
uh it will have to be strictly open

we
 

945
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,750
we
didn't didn't see a last version of

and
 

955
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,909
and
a lot of a lot of teams uh asks

a lot of a lot of teams uh asks
 

957
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,909
a lot of a lot of teams uh asks
ask averix and us

ask averix and us
 

959
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,470
ask averix and us
to create a more open source more open

960
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:38,480
to create a more open source more open
 

961
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,870
to create a more open source more open

963
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,110

products uh because we're able to

964
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
products uh because we're able to
 

965
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,630
products uh because we're able to
participate in it and we have uh

966
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
participate in it and we have uh
 

967
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,270
participate in it and we have uh
near 10 people it's uh very powerful

968
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,280
near 10 people it's uh very powerful
 

969
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,350
near 10 people it's uh very powerful
engineers inside our network

970
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,360
engineers inside our network
 

971
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,390
engineers inside our network
and uh

972
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
and uh
 

973
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,029
and uh
maybe some some of them will join to

974
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:55,039
maybe some some of them will join to
 

975
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,669
maybe some some of them will join to
poor development because for development

976
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
poor development because for development
 

977
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,630
poor development because for development
it's uh it's a main resource of network

978
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,640
it's uh it's a main resource of network
 

979
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,070
it's uh it's a main resource of network
and uh

980
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,080
and uh
 

981
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,029
and uh
i think we will grow twice maybe more in

982
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:05,039
i think we will grow twice maybe more in
 

983
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,150
i think we will grow twice maybe more in
two months

984
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,160
two months
 

985
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,950
two months
uh

986
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:06,960
uh
 

987
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,430
uh
because we'll become open source and

988
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:09,440
because we'll become open source and
 

989
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,350
because we'll become open source and
we will contribute to from roxas and

990
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,360
we will contribute to from roxas and
 

991
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,590
we will contribute to from roxas and
from independent developers

992
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
from independent developers
 

993
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,230
from independent developers
and it's important that in crypto window

994
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:16,240
and it's important that in crypto window
 

995
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,390
and it's important that in crypto window
uh every skill foundation will support

996
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,400
uh every skill foundation will support
 

997
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,549
uh every skill foundation will support
all of all people who can contribute

998
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:22,559
all of all people who can contribute
 

999
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,310
all of all people who can contribute
to core development

1000
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:24,320
to core development
 

1001
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,630
to core development
it's uh it will protect our network from

1002
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
it's uh it will protect our network from
 

1003
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,590
it's uh it will protect our network from
uh any intervention

1004
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,600

 

1005
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,750

great point certainly all right moving

1006
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:33,760
great point certainly all right moving
 

1007
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,630
great point certainly all right moving
on

1008
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
on
 

1009
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,510
on
the next one is grants and partnerships

1010
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,520
the next one is grants and partnerships
 

1011
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,190
the next one is grants and partnerships
um

1012
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
um
 

1013
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,950
um
basically i mean it's kind of

1014
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:40,960
basically i mean it's kind of
 

1015
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,950
basically i mean it's kind of
towards the same idea as we discussed in

1016
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:42,960
towards the same idea as we discussed in
 

1017
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,190
towards the same idea as we discussed in
the first point the idea basically the

1018
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
the first point the idea basically the
 

1019
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,669
the first point the idea basically the
fundamental idea behind this proposal is

1020
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
fundamental idea behind this proposal is
 

1021
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,830
fundamental idea behind this proposal is
to reward only for

1022
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
to reward only for
 

1023
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,630
to reward only for
a

1024
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:50,640
a
 

1025
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,029
a
contribution that that actually that is

1026
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
contribution that that actually that is
 

1027
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,630
contribution that that actually that is
proven and that

1028
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,640
proven and that
 

1029
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,630
proven and that
that this can be seen by everybody on

1030
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,640
that this can be seen by everybody on
 

1031
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,750
that this can be seen by everybody on
the network

1032
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760
the network
 

1033
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,909
the network
and here it's the same idea

1034
00:19:59,909 --> 00:19:59,919
and here it's the same idea
 

1035
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,470
and here it's the same idea
that uh that grants or any other forms

1036
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
that uh that grants or any other forms
 

1037
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,750
that uh that grants or any other forms
of rewards

1038
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760
of rewards
 

1039
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,909
of rewards
would be only executed after the

1040
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:05,919
would be only executed after the
 

1041
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,230
would be only executed after the
contribution physically happens so we

1042
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,240
contribution physically happens so we
 

1043
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,630
contribution physically happens so we
don't have situations that teams receive

1044
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:10,640
don't have situations that teams receive
 

1045
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,350
don't have situations that teams receive
grants or any other form again of reward

1046
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360
grants or any other form again of reward
 

1047
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,590
grants or any other form again of reward
and and then for whatever reason maybe

1048
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600
and and then for whatever reason maybe
 

1049
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,789
and and then for whatever reason maybe
simply because they just couldn't

1050
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
simply because they just couldn't
 

1051
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,270
simply because they just couldn't
execute or the idea was

1052
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,280
execute or the idea was
 

1053
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,870
execute or the idea was
did not find a product market fit or

1054
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:20,880
did not find a product market fit or
 

1055
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,630
did not find a product market fit or
whatever else

1056
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:22,640
whatever else
 

1057
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,070
whatever else
and the contribution physically did not

1058
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,080
and the contribution physically did not
 

1059
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,470
and the contribution physically did not
happen well those tokens would again hit

1060
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:26,480
happen well those tokens would again hit
 

1061
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,590
happen well those tokens would again hit
the market

1062
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,600
the market
 

1063
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,549
the market
so

1064
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:28,559
so
 

1065
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,390
so
this is a very simple idea and the

1066
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:30,400
this is a very simple idea and the
 

1067
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,029
this is a very simple idea and the
spin-off on this idea is that the grants

1068
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:33,039
spin-off on this idea is that the grants
 

1069
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,990
spin-off on this idea is that the grants
would come actually in dollars not in

1070
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,000
would come actually in dollars not in
 

1071
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,789
would come actually in dollars not in
northern tokens so that a it's easier

1072
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:38,799
northern tokens so that a it's easier
 

1073
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,310

00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,320
for the team to
 

1075
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,149
for the team to
cover its expenses it's it's not

1076
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
cover its expenses it's it's not
 

1077
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,710
cover its expenses it's it's not
volatile as some of the tokens uh

1078
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,720
volatile as some of the tokens uh
 

1079
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,390

00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:46,400

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,590
including of course ever
and also again if uh

1082
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600
and also again if uh
 

1083
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,070
and also again if uh
to eliminate cases of uh

1084
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,080
to eliminate cases of uh
 

1085
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,909
to eliminate cases of uh
cases of uh

1086
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:53,919
cases of uh
 

1087
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,990
cases of uh
tokens hit in the market so again the

1088
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,000
tokens hit in the market so again the
 

1089
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,190
tokens hit in the market so again the
idea is to

1090
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,200
idea is to
 

1091
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,909
idea is to
improve the supply demand on the market

1092
00:20:59,909 --> 00:20:59,919
improve the supply demand on the market
 

1093
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:06,710
improve the supply demand on the market
comments sergey for another surgery

1094
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720

 

1095
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,190

all comments for the hours

1096
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,200

 

1097
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,669

yeah and it will be financed from the by

1098
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:13,679
yeah and it will be financed from the by
 

1099
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,270
yeah and it will be financed from the by
the crystal hands program which was

1100
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:15,280
the crystal hands program which was
 

1101
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,909
the crystal hands program which was
presented by the detailed alliance

1102
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:17,919
presented by the detailed alliance
 

1103
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,430
presented by the detailed alliance
that would be the source of funding for

1104
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,440
that would be the source of funding for
 

1105
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,430
that would be the source of funding for
this one

1106
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:21,440
this one
 

1107
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,110
this one
and then last but not least as we

1108
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,120
and then last but not least as we
 

1109
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,789
and then last but not least as we
discussed what we discussed now for a

1110
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:24,799
discussed what we discussed now for a
 

1111
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,310
discussed what we discussed now for a
year or more now

1112
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:26,320
year or more now
 

1113
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,470
year or more now
is there is our continuous ideas to

1114
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:28,480
is there is our continuous ideas to
 

1115
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,590
is there is our continuous ideas to
eliminate

1116
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:29,600
eliminate
 

1117
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,710
eliminate
issuance uh during the validation

1118
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:32,720
issuance uh during the validation
 

1119
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,950
issuance uh during the validation
so there is now a simple idea finally to

1120
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
so there is now a simple idea finally to
 

1121
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,590
so there is now a simple idea finally to
allocate 200 million tokens to validate

1122
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:37,600
allocate 200 million tokens to validate
 

1123
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,669
allocate 200 million tokens to validate
our subsidy fund and stop the issuance

1124
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:39,679
our subsidy fund and stop the issuance
 

1125
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,750
our subsidy fund and stop the issuance
of new tokens and what it basically

1126
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,760
of new tokens and what it basically
 

1127
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,510
of new tokens and what it basically
means is that

1128
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:43,520
means is that
 

1129
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,750
means is that
would be compensated from that fund uh

1130
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:45,760
would be compensated from that fund uh
 

1131
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,029
would be compensated from that fund uh
for their work it would be enough for a

1132
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:49,039
for their work it would be enough for a
 

1133
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,510
for their work it would be enough for a
large amount of years given that we only

1134
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:51,520
large amount of years given that we only
 

1135
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,350
large amount of years given that we only
spent 60 millions in the last couple of

1136
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360
spent 60 millions in the last couple of
 

1137
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,230
spent 60 millions in the last couple of
years

1138
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,240
years
 

1139
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,909
years
on during network existence on

1140
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:55,919
on during network existence on
 

1141
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,070
on during network existence on
validation and even if there is some

1142
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,080
validation and even if there is some
 

1143
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,870
validation and even if there is some
sort of you know acceleration uh we

1144
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:00,880
sort of you know acceleration uh we
 

1145
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,549
sort of you know acceleration uh we
have enough enough tokens for quite a

1146
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:02,559
have enough enough tokens for quite a
 

1147
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,430
have enough enough tokens for quite a
while

1148
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:03,440
while
 

1149
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,789
while
and um

1150
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:04,799
and um
 

1151
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,950
and um
that will make investors very happy uh

1152
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:06,960
that will make investors very happy uh
 

1153
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,870
that will make investors very happy uh
those investors who were concerned that

1154
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:08,880
those investors who were concerned that
 

1155
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,510
those investors who were concerned that
continuous emission dilutes their you

1156
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,520
continuous emission dilutes their you
 

1157
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,350
continuous emission dilutes their you
know essentially they're holding in the

1158
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,360
know essentially they're holding in the
 

1159
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,070
know essentially they're holding in the
network so it's a very simple idea

1160
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080
network so it's a very simple idea
 

1161
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,510
network so it's a very simple idea
comments folks

1162
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:19,520

 

1163
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,190

uh yeah

1164
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,200
uh yeah
 

1165
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,590
uh yeah
uh about one years ago i

1166
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:23,600
uh about one years ago i
 

1167
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,070
uh about one years ago i
say that uh

1168
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,080
say that uh
 

1169
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,310
say that uh
we have a minor emission network and

1170
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,320
we have a minor emission network and
 

1171
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,390
we have a minor emission network and
it's uh doesn't matter

1172
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:30,400
it's uh doesn't matter
 

1173
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,789
it's uh doesn't matter
uh because it's not big amount of tokens

1174
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:32,799
uh because it's not big amount of tokens
 

1175
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,669
uh because it's not big amount of tokens
if you will compare it without treasury

1176
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:35,679
if you will compare it without treasury
 

1177
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,230
if you will compare it without treasury
but a lot of investors told to us again

1178
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240
but a lot of investors told to us again
 

1179
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,470
but a lot of investors told to us again
in the game that uh emission uh it's uh

1180
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,480
in the game that uh emission uh it's uh
 

1181
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,630
in the game that uh emission uh it's uh
it's a big thought it's a big topic and

1182
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:44,640
it's a big thought it's a big topic and
 

1183
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,710
it's a big thought it's a big topic and
uh if you have a lot of tokens of

1184
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:46,720
uh if you have a lot of tokens of
 

1185
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,190
uh if you have a lot of tokens of
surgery the right way uses tokens

1186
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,200

surgery the right way uses tokens
uh especially it was from some asian

1188
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,080
uh especially it was from some asian

investors
 

1191
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,990
investors
because in their mind if i joined the

1192
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000
because in their mind if i joined the
 

1193
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,950
because in their mind if i joined the
project

1194
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:56,960
project
 

1195
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,390
project
they do it for five and ten years and uh

1196
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,400
they do it for five and ten years and uh
 

1197
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,110
they do it for five and ten years and uh
from from their perspective

1198
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,120
from from their perspective
 

1199
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,669
from from their perspective
uh emissions is a big problem

1200
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:05,679
uh emissions is a big problem
 

1201
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,470
uh emissions is a big problem
and this is why i changed my mind and

1202
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:08,480
and this is why i changed my mind and
 

1203
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,630
and this is why i changed my mind and
now i'm strong support to stop a mission

1204
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:10,640
now i'm strong support to stop a mission
 

1205
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,270
now i'm strong support to stop a mission
and i use

1206
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,280
and i use
 

1207
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,110
and i use
tokens from givers

1208
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,120
tokens from givers
 

1209
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,510
tokens from givers
for a different kind of

1213
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,870

1295
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,029

us yep a couple of words from my side uh

1296
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:03,039
us yep a couple of words from my side uh
 

1297
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,390
us yep a couple of words from my side uh
i think that

1298
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,400
i think that
 

1299
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,669
i think that
uh all these five reforms uh will bring

1300
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:07,679
uh all these five reforms uh will bring
 

1301
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,590
uh all these five reforms uh will bring
more clarity to

1302
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:09,600
more clarity to
 

1303
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,549
more clarity to
investors uh on how

1304
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:12,559
investors uh on how
 

1305
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,510
investors uh on how
our treasury should be spent

1306
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
our treasury should be spent
 

1307
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,310
our treasury should be spent
and

1308
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,320
and
 

1309
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,710
and
what are the motivation programs for

1310
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:18,720
what are the motivation programs for
 

1311
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,430
what are the motivation programs for
different participants of the ecosystem

1312
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:21,440
different participants of the ecosystem
 

1313
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,190
different participants of the ecosystem

initial members
 

1325
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,310
initial members
and in my view the

1326
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
and in my view the
 

1327
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,310
and in my view the
current timing is

1328
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,320
current timing is
 

1329
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,669
current timing is
so important for investors so that

1330
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:41,679
so important for investors so that
 

1331
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,549
so important for investors so that
we

1332
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:42,559
we
 

1333
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,350
we
limit significantly uncontrolled issues

1334
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:45,360
limit significantly uncontrolled issues
 

1335
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,549
limit significantly uncontrolled issues
of tokens

1336
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:46,559
of tokens
 

1337
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,310
of tokens
and provide motivation in the same time

1338
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:50,320
and provide motivation in the same time
 

1339
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,029
and provide motivation in the same time
so

1340
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:51,039
so
 

1341
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:51,830
so
this

1342
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
this
 

1343
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,149
this
in my view this proposal could solve

1344
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:54,159
in my view this proposal could solve
 

1345
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:01,029
in my view this proposal could solve
both problems with one shot

1346
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:01,039

 

1347
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,029

00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:42,400
due to the test configuration or
 

1387
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,710
due to the test configuration or
this is caused by the current design

1388
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:44,720
this is caused by the current design
 

1389
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,870
this is caused by the current design
if due to the current design what is the

1390
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
if due to the current design what is the
 

1391
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,549
if due to the current design what is the
reason um

1392
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:48,559
reason um
 

1393
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,269
reason um
and

1394
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:49,279
and
 

1395
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:56,149
and
load rebalancing question mark

1396
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:56,159

 

1397
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,710

uh yeah yeah about this test uh

1398
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:58,720
uh yeah yeah about this test uh
 

1399
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,230
uh yeah yeah about this test uh
we did it

1400
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:00,240
we did it
 

1401
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,630
we did it
by biogym because

1402
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:02,640
by biogym because
 

1403
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,950
by biogym because
because we need to understand real

1404
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:04,960
because we need to understand real
 

1405
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,950
because we need to understand real
situation and

1406
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:06,960
situation and
 

1407
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,029
situation and
and how it's work not in test net how

1408
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:09,039
and how it's work not in test net how
 

1409
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,950
and how it's work not in test net how
it's working mainnet

1410
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:10,960
it's working mainnet
 

1411
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,190
it's working mainnet
because uh it's impossible to be solid

1412
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,200
because uh it's impossible to be solid
 

1413
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,830
because uh it's impossible to be solid
with any negotiations with big partners

1414
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:15,840
with any negotiations with big partners
 

1415
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,070
with any negotiations with big partners
uh if you're not sure

1416
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,080
uh if you're not sure
 

1417
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,750
uh if you're not sure
so this is why we launched with stress

1418
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:19,760
so this is why we launched with stress
 

1419
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,789
so this is why we launched with stress
test

1420
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:20,799
test
 

1421
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,630
test
about about results

1422
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:22,640
about about results
 

1423
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,269
about about results
uh stress test was uh near our internal

1424
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:27,279
uh stress test was uh near our internal
 

1425
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,430
uh stress test was uh near our internal
estimation

1426
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,440
estimation
 

1427
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,389
estimation
uh how how it will be working reality

1428
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:32,399
uh how how it will be working reality
 

1429
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,590
uh how how it will be working reality
and uh okay in one chain we achieved uh

1430
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:35,600
and uh okay in one chain we achieved uh
 

1431
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,310
and uh okay in one chain we achieved uh
uh 4 000 tps um maybe we can achieve

1432
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:40,320
uh 4 000 tps um maybe we can achieve
 

1433
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,269
uh 4 000 tps um maybe we can achieve
more

1434
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:41,279
more
 

1435
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,789
more
but uh we want to test it with ram

1436
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:44,799
but uh we want to test it with ram
 

1437
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,549
but uh we want to test it with ram
uh because because because of a ramp

1438
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:48,559
uh because because because of a ramp
 

1439
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,590
uh because because because of a ramp
we can change our test design and work

1440
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:51,600
we can change our test design and work
 

1441
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,710
we can change our test design and work
more with different external messages

1442
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:54,720
more with different external messages
 

1443
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,470
more with different external messages
and

1444
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:56,480
and
 

1445
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,350
and
the next step of our ramp when we will

1446
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,360
the next step of our ramp when we will
 

1447
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,549
the next step of our ramp when we will
get

1448
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:00,559
get
 

1449
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,029
get
a different for chain inside

1450
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:03,039
a different for chain inside
 

1451
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,750
a different for chain inside
uh we will we will continue our stress

1452
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:05,760
uh we will we will continue our stress
 

1453
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,310
uh we will we will continue our stress
tests uh because uh this swiss test is a

1454
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,320

good proof for our partners that our

1456
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:13,600
good proof for our partners that our
 

1457
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,470
good proof for our partners that our
network is real speed and real scalable

1458

uh
 

1461
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,430
uh
the main problem of in the during this

1462
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:19,440
the main problem of in the during this
 

1463
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,230
the main problem of in the during this
stress test was different dubs

1464
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,240
stress test was different dubs
 

1465
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,470
stress test was different dubs
uh we saw a lot of problems with

1466
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:26,480
uh we saw a lot of problems with
 

1467
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,190
uh we saw a lot of problems with
flood cube and bridge

1468

flood cube and bridge
 

1469
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,389
flood cube and bridge
because our internal architecture

1470
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:32,399
because our internal architecture
 

1471
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,789
because our internal architecture
didn't support some things and now we

1472
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:34,799
didn't support some things and now we
 

1473
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,710
didn't support some things and now we
are fixing it

1474
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:36,720
are fixing it
 

1475
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,669
are fixing it
because because we want to

rust cup rewards distribution there was

1528
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,200
rust cup rewards distribution there was
 

1529
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,789
rust cup rewards distribution there was
actually a good reason for not

1530
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:42,799
actually a good reason for not
 

1531
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,870
actually a good reason for not
distributing it

1532
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:44,880
distributing it
 

1533
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,710
distributing it
more than half a year ago

1534
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:46,720
more than half a year ago

unfortunately

1536
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,120

we didn't expect that some development

1538
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:51,679
we didn't expect that some development
 

1539
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,870
we didn't expect that some development
will take

1540
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:52,880
will take
 

1541
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,669
will take
that long and at the moment

1542
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:55,679
that long and at the moment
 

1543
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,070
that long and at the moment
i personally think that that was mistake

1544
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,080
i personally think that that was mistake
 

1545
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,350
i personally think that that was mistake
to

1546
00:29:59,350 --> 00:29:59,360
to
 

1547
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,510
to
prolong and to postpone distribution of

1548
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,520
prolong and to postpone distribution of
 

1549
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,470
prolong and to postpone distribution of
rewards but what is done cannot be

1550
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:06,480
rewards but what is done cannot be
 

1551
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,590
rewards but what is done cannot be
undone

1552
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:07,600
undone
 

1553
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,070
undone
so we are now in a position when uh

1554
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,080
so we are now in a position when uh
 

1555
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,549
so we are now in a position when uh
actually

1556
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:12,559
