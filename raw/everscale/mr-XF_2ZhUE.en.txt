hello guys
[Music]
hello
[Music]
okay traditionally we'll wait for one
more minute and let's start
[Music]
okay let's begin
so we have a
very short agenda for today
unfortunately uh the team that uh was
going to present the idoc contest and
the vision of
development of this section so they
didn't manage to join us today but they
for sure will join uh next time
and uh in between so they will publish a
draft of the
ideo
launchpad
contest
so uh
they're for sure we'll drop the link in
the chat and on the forum too and we'll
explain the details
uh
on the next call
so uh i will not spoil it for now and
uh
we will have a
possibility to discuss next time
so uh
let's start with traditional contest
updates and so first of all i would like
to congratulate the winners of the
oracles
contest
there was only one submission from the
prevender team and
it passed the quorum hopefully for the
first time
and got the minimum threshold and
all together so congratulations guys so
you managed to do this so but uh still
there's a
big amount of work to do so
for sure there will be the second
iteration of the contest including the
economical part and
more precise uh understanding on the
decentralization standpoint and uh
yeah so there are still some points to
improve uh that can be done in the next
step
the second uh update is about the
uh dex contest so actually the
submission period is over so and we have
11 days to vote
uh
with
five submissions uh so
please jurors uh have a look on them and
guys who have submitted for the dex
contest i expect you to run the ama
session or at least post a video demo of
your solution to facilitate jurors work
so uh please dm me uh when you're ready
to run the mma session so you can do
this all together or one by one so we
still have a plenty of time let's do
this starting from tomorrow
so who is ready to be first
so you can do this
if you are ready to do this today so we
have a lot of time so you can do this
today
and
as for the ssi implementation contest
there are still eight days for
submissions uh after that we will be
voting for those who submit
so please uh do not wait until the very
last moment for not to miss the deadline
uh that's it for updates about contests
um
do you have some questions or discussion
on top on top of this
i know okay
so
then just for the fun fact so i'll just
drop you there some updates about the
economic activity uh
in in the device sector today so uh what
we have done swap uh actually
we have uh reached
27.3 million dollars in tbl and we
expect it uh to grow rapidly after the
second uh version of the bridge is fully
functional and have interfaces
uh
with 27.5 tbl uh locked at farms so uh
obviously almost uh 95 to 97 percent of
the total tbl transform is currently
locked
in farming
and some
some extra is on top because of the uni
swap lp tokens that are also uh logged
there
uh and over the recent 24 hours there
was a turnover for
over uh 500k
dollars
so with 1.5 million in
the past seven days
uh
by the way i'm really thinking about uh
having some
data worksheet that is
that is updated
on a weekly basis it shows the activity
uh you know the network and guys who are
uh developing the access so if you can
submit this information to me as well so
we will include this in the aggregated
data sheet and
post it together with the define
alliance's updates on the device sector
news
and also uh what i want to do to add to
our weekly calls is the uh some digest
about
uh the recent updates of the defy
products that we
have launched in the
freight town so please
dear teams so if you have some major
updates you have something to tell uh
what you're proud of so please film in
advance so i will include the updates in
in the digest
uh so that's actually pretty it for
today
so now not nothing more to say so and if
you have any additional topics that you
forgot to tell me before
so uh please so asean source is saying
something in the chat what's the name of
the contest it was about to be announced
uh yeah it's a contest about the launch
pads actually so uh initial decks
offering uh
in freetown
uh yeah ideo right absolutely
this is uh something not really new for
the defy world but still if we want to
attract a lot of projects and uh
let them
start from the uh
right network i mean return of course so
we need to provide them with the tool
sets uh that
will facilitate the launching of the
project and uh interacting with
investors
uh and so on and so forth it's not an
easy task so and under i know that you
had
some experience in the past yeah so uh
in terms of icos so i think you can be
an expert in this and uh
for sure i expect you to participate in
the drafts in the contest
yeah
that's true that's true i had some some
experience and it was fun but it's
really hard with it it's definitely hard
and in the ideal sector especially with
the tough pressure by the regulation uh
government's recognition so now it's we
should be extremely
cautious when we form such contests and
uh
when
requesting people to develop such
platforms but hopefully so we already
have at least several uh teams that are
ready to participate in this contest and
um
so one of the teams will be presented
next time that they promised
and three more to come maybe they will
also at least one or two more will be
able to join
our call and tell about themselves
so if you and or if you also plan to
participate so you can start thinking
already
about what can be improved
i hope that we will draft the
uh contest
very soon
this will mean
that by end of tomorrow and
post it for
community review to the forum so please
also join
share your available comments
yeah
okay
anything else to discuss guys please
okay
uh i will be uh
in dubai
the the week starting from actually
october the 10th till october the 16th
so if you happen to be there also so
just text me so let's meet
so there we go what's happening
uh there are actually happening two
conferences one is wow conference uh
it's about
uh mostly fintech and uh investor
relations
uh and some other sectors so just just a
good mix
uh mita probably is is present there too
if i remember it well yes i am yeah yeah
and uh another one i i forgot its name
it's it's something abbreviated so uh
it's more about uh the fund related uh
conference so we will be presenting also
the uh free tone and discussing about
the device sector uh
from the defy lines
uh
so yeah you want to say something
yeah i actually wanted to talk about
uh like just to ask about the dex uh
contest and uh
should we present this place solution
like not like scheduled already page
well right now i don't think so let me
ask
uh we weren't but i didn't think that we
were going to present today so we didn't
kind of uh
prepare
no it's absolutely fine
yeah yeah so let's schedule as a demo
because
what is it when you have ama session
like prevent the team for example d
significantly helps people to vote votes
at least vote and understand what they
are voting for so um because not
everyone was able to join but at least
when you
can listen to the recording so it really
helps
with pleasure
very good that's scheduled i i would
love to hear you
tell about the exact time
yeah uh preferably earlier than later of
course so uh monday i think will be
ideal choice
uh
for to schedule at least
i have my personal schedule uh quite
loose on on monday so uh
i have some time now there's a tough day
usually
oh maybe we can we can schedule it on to
use the um
maybe after the governance call or
something
yeah yeah good choice
you see already some time slots are
being booked so guys please don't to the
side

order book exchange or will there be
also mm presentation

so all good
uh peter by the way did you know that
there is a token named meteor moon

to my mind that why not meet you soon

have seen quite a drastic interest in
the tokens creation so i see over uh 150
tokens being created over the
uh past two weeks so uh some of them
with a quite fun names like uh
