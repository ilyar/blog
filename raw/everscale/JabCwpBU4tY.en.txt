okay um okay well hello everybody
welcome to weekly meet number 106. we
have an awesome lineup this week and a
lot to get through which is exciting i
actually had to push a couple
presentations next week because we had a
lot of stuff going on which is great and
also happiest of birthdays to everex
which turned four
on sunday yay four awesome years
so let's kick it off uh
hi everybody
um let's kick it off and uh
hello michael would you like to start
off with the tech updates
yeah fine
um
so
take updates
uh all right uh
we kind of yeah we're
trying to upgrade the network um
we've discovered some problem with the
latest upgrade on the
what it's called
the freebsd
um without docker installation
fixing it now
and uh
yeah
we will test it and then there will be
additional release
with the fixes
apart from that
um
there is a
launch on flex of flex this week
the production we
released a beta version
a few days ago
to the to the group
of our early testers
and that looks
good
we
will support
four trading pairs
to start from
this will be the trading pairs that's
supported by flat cube as well
um
so
um
will be easy to arbitrage
um
and then we will start dating they'd say
it's uh so the
like
flexes supporting
we added the support of
all broxas tokens
so you can trade them on flex
and
[Music]
we will start from these four pairs and
they will we will expand it's it's not a
problem to expand but i just i just want
to
of course like you need don't trade with
a lot of money for now just to start
from you know just a normal normal
precaution
um
so use use
the money that you're ready to lose if
anything happened despite the fact that
the contracts have been
you know
audited the first
the new the latest version
has already passed the first stage of
formal verification but uh it's not
formally verified yet
uh all of it so you should you know be
cautious
that
you know um
yeah
so
um
what else
the
the gosh
update maybe a little
um
so
we had a very very good results first
two weeks after the launch
we got to get the stats from docker
which i cannot share but it's really
nice
um
[Music]
it's um
[Music]
like we now in the phase where we
got a lot of feedback from developers
and we change uh some things so we kind
of releasing now we'll release now the
second version
um
we are going to be presented on vivotech
with one of our paris on may on june
18th with one of our partners
um to demonstrate the solution for the
space industry and um
so yeah so that will be quite exciting
we will show how gosh can be used to
um
[Music]
like
upload instructions to satellites
to change the like
the
you know
parameters of the satellite
and then the
also
kind of they upgrade the satellite
software
uh from gosh
now using you know and and uh obviously
this is this is
like ultimate use case because this is
the most mission critical application
you can think about
so it goes to the moon
yeah exactly it goes to the moon
directly literally goes to the moon this
is the first token that literally goes
to the moon
yeah
um
we are planning on now also kwpc and kwt
like if
whatever news
there will be um
first um
we're planning to having like the first
session
uh
maybe even this sunday we will see
how that goes
for
gosh actually
um
for gosh staking
that the program that we're preparing
for
uh everscale
you know participants members
um so they so you can be the first to
kind of
to
uh to participate
in that uh
then
you know so we will we will have some
interesting investors on the call
uh that's not a call one so it's a show
uh on the show and then um we have a lot
of plans for
this month because flex started so we
just waited for that as you know
and um
there will be
as in the next special session around
the time of the
of the viva tech
[Music]
trade show
so there will be a special session about
about gosh but i will let you know when
it will be
you know
fixed dates
so we have also like a huge pipeline of
projects uh for
uh
for flex
um
in in our pipeline on on
kwpc show
and actually
because we you know announced the launch
of flex
there's a lot of projects that came
uh actually
and the pipeline grew for last two weeks
the pipeline grew like three times
uh we're almost kind of running out of
the capacity to to
um
to look at all the projects
so that um it's really encouraging news
i think because of because of the you
know so many projects want to start
uh on on never scale or do something
with flex or never scale so these are
these are good
but
um
we are
not certain
on how to proceed right now because of
the different
because of the uncertainty of the of the
flexed economics
and
flex business development
going forward
therefore we have to
kind
of um
we will
we will discuss that probably on the
on the call
when we'll have the call
on the first row
and then we will decide
if we
kind of
what we're doing with this
situation
so right now
it's um
it's not up to us but the cooperation
between kwpc
and flex
is
like
is not certain
we don't understand the status
and
therefore
in it's quite hard to kind of you know
it's uh
we're um
investing money
into that project
and into everything we have done
and there is no absolutely no support
from the community and absolutely no
support from flex
absolutely no support from mavericks
um
so
you know we will have to
we have to decide what to do with the
project going forward
if we continue on
um
every scale or not
so this is this is my status thank you
oh okay
um well i'm glad to hear that gosh has
launched successfully um and the team's
happy there
and looking forward to
uh killer whale
show debuting
i think you mentioned this week
or maybe the beginning of june that
would be exciting looking forward to
that
um
we do have a question from community to
tag on to the tech updates it's from
ilyar and i believe it's about
uh
updating the nodes and ama that you
recently had he says that there was a
plan to do a text version of technical
updates
which are spoken out on the ama and
published them to the validator channel
which was planned to be cleaned of
promotional information will this happen
or not and thanks for your work you do
cool stuff thanks
is that the question to me
yes um it's about the um
[Music]
the ama that i believe you recently
held um
about updating nodes and i think it was
in the russian channel and they're
asking about a text version because it
was a spoken ama
text version of the iama
and we didn't have any ama on the node
um
what am i
what's the last ama
you did you did a call with validators
after the incident on mainland
okay then yeah we did the call okay yeah
there was there was some some some
decision i i wasn't present on that call
but but i know that illyar
asking now about
some some
some some updates
like on
on what you
sort of
so you agreed on the call that you will
post the updates to the channel or or
something
uh we didn't upgrade
we didn't update well we kind of pushed
update on the scrap that day because
because there was a report about uh
about the issue
with uh
with the freebsd
and we scrapped that date and we're
working on on kind of getting the new
one now
um
what else i mean
i
like what what do you want me to do with
the ama i didn't i didn't get it
i think this is something that we could
figure out off of the call someone can
just um
transcribe the ama i think that's all he
wants
and then we post it to the validator
channel well i'm not going to do that no
i know i know why do we have a name it's
just a just a question
but we'll get it sorted um okay so
moving on uh there was a bit of a switch
in the agenda so we have to
push the everscale marketing update
first so we have nikita and alex who are
joining us today to give us an update on
what's been going on with gravity coin
market cap conference that just happened
and
the bitmart listing and i think some
other things as well so
welcome
i actually uh if alex is on the call he
could uh tell about gravity and the core
market cap conference alex if you would
like to go forward please
no you're on mute
i'm sorry yeah i'm here sorry nikita i
was a mute really so yeah i can i can
begin for sure
uh
let me share my screen first so for
those who don't know me my name is
alexander i'm representing the marketing
organization of everscale and i'm here
to give you a quick update on what's
going on on everscale
marketing recently so
we've got
a couple of couple of news recently
uh
i would say number one is what put it on
coin market cap gravity
uh for those who don't know it it's a
new social network by coin market cap
which is a kind of mix of twitter and
medium or you can put articles or posts
about our activities it is accessible
directly from coin market cap from
[Music]
token from a token page so everyone who
comes there can see the updates
and uh
we've been included into a group of
selected organizations to join it on the
priority basis so we're in the company
of steppen on b chain so it's a good
company and amazingly we could make it
from 0 to 5k uh followers in less than a
week i believe
thanks to our community thanks to
everyone who is there if you haven't yet
uh followed us on coin market cap
gravity please do it's quite simple you
just need to be registered on coin
market cap normally then find us click
follow and off we go let's make it 10k i
would say but all in all it's a great
great achievement given the
monthly audience of coin market cap is
massive it's over
160 million of people coming to coin
market cap every day and it really helps
us to make a good progress and even more
people started to come to our website as
we started doing this thing which is i
think is a pretty good news
another thing that we did recently
was an amazing event by coin market cap
again it's called it's their annual
event which is called the capital
and the title for this year was time to
ship it happened uh on the end of the
previous week on thursday friday and we
we were presented as gold one of gold
sponsors of the whole event which took
place in metaverse so we've had a cool
metaverse booth
even not a booth in a small room where
everyone could could come and and and
chilled on on our
how to say small sofas and behind our
tables
we've got an opening and opening a part
of day one opening uh how to say session
with us our word which was taken by
nikita as you can see on the screen we
also took an active part in panel
discussions it was
uh michael gord a representative of
everscale foundation and nikita also so
uh
what do coin market cap say they saying
that about five k visitors
attended the event i don't know if it's
how uh what is the final number maybe it
will change because they are in the
process of calculating including all the
live stream use but uh
yeah i think it was it was a good take
from outside and there are more
opportunities from sponsorship that will
keep you know keep utilizing in the
following weeks
uh
so
our pr our pr goes non-stop so we're
going on plan and our plan is to have a
good article each
one or two weeks
at least and we're again we're posting
key updates and key events so some pr
regarding coin market cap activities is
coming and here is an example of what we
did on
ramp on a ramp integra ramp development
it we had on total over
over 300 mentions over 300
mentions on youtube which is good if we
google that article name and uh
and that was there were binsinga and
other good good mediums
there so yeah that that's a quick update
from my site
and we keep working
every day to further increase our
marketing uh exposure for everscale and
the ecosystem
that's it from my site
thank you you guys are certainly really
busy i'm happy to see so much great
things coming out of the um every scale
marketing initiative
nikita did you want to jump in and say
something
um no
actually uh alex said most of the things
i just want to say that
uh we are also doubling our reference on
uh prs
everything we are you know
you know saying to the world we're
trying to promote as hard as possible
also we have initiative uh to promote
our plans are rolled back
and we are actually soon
um
maybe in
maybe two weeks or something like that
maybe even um sooner we will have the
you know every user will i mean
like let's take a step back a lot of
projects you know uh have a lot of plans
have a lot of road maps that uh and very
strange things are written there uh and
these things are not you know uh
on um
it's not easy to understand you know for
for the average customer what does that
you know each part of rope means so
uh as alex said we are from uh doing
articles of ramp on each basically on
most of the
you know steps in our roadmap we will do
separate prs
uh we already uh started creating um a
separate article for each separate
step of the roadmap and they will be
even separate videos with infographics
showing the
the utility of each step of the roadmap
so uh i know that the best you know way
to promote everscale is to let people
understand how superior the technology
is so we are really working hard on
promoting uh not just what we have but
what we are planning to do because it's
really really great
uh
everybody will be will have an
opportunity to really understand more
because even actually guys from our team
uh not everybody can you know say with
simple words uh
you know
again
about the rem stuff or some other stuff
about the drive chain about anything
else what is you know how does it work
and why do we need it why is it cool and
uh why doesn't you know everybody else
do the same thing
so we are uh
doing a lot of
work in trying to
formulate a roadmap in simple words and
promote this you know simple words to
general public so everybody will
understand
why every scale is really great in in
from the technical perspective at least
and maybe soon from a marketing
perspective as well
very cool

thank you
thank you king meowtis for
blessing us with your
presence
you're here and you're welcome
for now i'm leaving
okay
that was
interesting
moving on we're going to jump into the
gba conference and devote there was a
really successful presentation
of devote at the gba conference last
week in dc and we have eugene here with
us to tell us more
yes uh hello everyone and thank you very
much for letting me speak so indeed last
week
everscale participated in the government
blockchain association
uh conference in um
washington dc it was a long event three
day conference um
i'm showing you a picture please note
that everscale banner was uh located
immediately uh to the left of a gba
banner and was very visible to the
audience now
our presence there was meant to address
several ways to promote everscale
number one uh yes we presented um one of
the products that was developed uh by
everscale community
uh called devote
and i'll talk about it a little later
but the second purpose of our presence
there was to lead the dao panel
there is a lot of interest uh today in
forming different daos in the united
states uh some
states like wisconsin for example uh
wyoming sorry uh are actually allowing
registration of daos
so uh it was an important discussion um
where we were
covering uh different uh aspects of
forming and using the dowels for our
everyday activities
now um going back uh to the to devote
first of all it's important to
understand that uh the audience of this
particular conference consisted
primarily of legislators
senators and representatives
and government
there were government representatives
from more than 30 countries
there were several ambassadors uh
including san salvador ambassador who
also spoke uh about uh the experiences
the country is having um with bitcoin as
a legal tender
and most of the conference activity was
aimed at explaining the legislators
what
should they do in terms of regulating
the space
so it was very important to show a
significant contributions that
blockchain based
apps
and tools can bring to this society
so devote was used
as an example of such a tool in fact
there was an art show running
concurrently
with uh the uh
with the conference itself
and devote was announced as a voting
platform so all of participants of the
conference that were physically there
could view the art show and vote for the
best nft it was obviously a show of
digital works of art
and nfts were voted for for the first
time i know they also had a music
category
and their their photography and story
and some other categories that people
submitted their works and by the way
some of everscale nft teams also
participated including grand bazaar
including nephi club thank you very much
so um
everybody
at the conference had to register on the
first day
then they voting window opened and
people were selecting the best works
that they chose
and then we had a window where the
magical
zero knowledge snarks technology
developed by neil foundation
actually tallied the results which were
later announced at the rewards ceremony
with
some wonderful trophies
made
by
gba were given two winners um
and in the end i had an opportunity to
actually explain to people that this is
the first
known case where a public voting where
anybody at the conference can
participate was done with the use of
zero knowledge snarks technology so
again
everybody who participated thank you
very much for your support it was very
much a team effort
we already have some very interesting
results of our show
and that is first and foremost uh
government blockchain association wants
to elect the new cto using devote
boise state university representative
came to me they want to do a
college-wide elections this summer
using the vote
i have had uh susan eustis susan is a
legend in elections industry in the us
she
invented the first in the world uh
bulletin counting machine some 50 years
ago we have a demo
for her and we also received interest
from representatives of a number of
states particularly massachusetts rhode
island florida they want to explore
further
that concludes my report to you i
welcome any questions
that is excellent that was a super
update thank you eugene it's it's really
an awesome use case uh to see everscale
technology in real life and thank you
for showing a picture too you showed um
there are a lot more images that you
shared in the chats so maybe we can
circulate circulate that in the
community chat too because it's very
interesting
uh we do have questions for you
um you have a cool project devote tell
me how can i take part in its testing as
a user
uh yes it's a great question uh for now
uh just send me a direct message and
we'll include you into the group that is
working to further develop
make no mistake we are not there yet
there's still a lot of work to be done
and we need both
people with development skills
and people willing to contribute their
time to help us in some other ways so
for now just contact me directly and
everybody is welcome to help developers
especially thank you
okay
um and the same person who asked this
question would also like uh if you
shared some links with more technical
information about how this technology
the zk works in everscale he'd like to
get
minimal code examples with reproducible
builds and wants to try the power of
everscale by hand
so
maybe if there are some
direct links that you can share um
do you know
nope i think he's frozen
um well yes same same person iliac just
ping eugene and he will shoot that over
to
you okay
um if are there any mother other
questions

up being a pretty quick call um stay
tuned for next week yeah i think kicked
out of the zoom and i may not have heard
all the questions uh if there were any
left um i can certainly answer i don't
know yeah it was um somebody wants some
technical documentation because they
want to try it out the zk technologies
so i told them that they could ping you
directly and you'll send some links over
thank you cool
okay cool
so thank you everybody that's about the
end of the call
