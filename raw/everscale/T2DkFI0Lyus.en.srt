uh we can we can do
 

219
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,749
uh we can we can do
uh some different things and

uh some different things and
 

221
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,790
uh some different things and
for example we can burn token and we can

222
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
for example we can burn token and we can
 

223
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,189
for example we can burn token and we can
restore token in another place

224
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
restore token in another place
 

225
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,270

but uh it's impossible to move this
 

227
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,950

and uh when we start migration uh we got

248
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
and uh when we start migration uh we got
 

249
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,710
and uh when we start migration uh we got
we got risk

250
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
we got risk
 

251
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,029
we got risk
because uh during migration dow can't

252
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
because uh during migration dow can't
 

253
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:03,990

uh and and also now is very slow
 

257
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,469
uh and and also now is very slow
uh for in our bridge now we can set up

258
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
uh for in our bridge now we can set up
 

259
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,070
uh for in our bridge now we can set up

one decision during seven days not less
 

261
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,070
one decision during seven days not less
and it's very optimistic

262
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
and it's very optimistic
 

263
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,550
and it's very optimistic
it's missing seven days uh in our

264
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
it's missing seven days uh in our
 

265
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,390
it's missing seven days uh in our
practice it's up to 10 14 days

protocol and as of now so we strongly

450
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
protocol and as of now so we strongly
 

451
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,509

uh so now uh let's let's get to the to
the migration that's how how it works so

460
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
the migration that's how how it works so
 

461
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,630
the migration that's how how it works so
and spencer gay said that we had four to

462

and spencer gay said that we had four to
 

463
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,110

five months to prepare it it's it's not

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:16,880
difficult work that we started
 

469
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,389
difficult work that we started
uh at early october and a trunk and

470
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
uh at early october and a trunk and
 

471
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,350
uh at early october and a trunk and
even although the standard itself was

at that moment but
 

477
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,590
at that moment but
uh the just to describe the sequence of

00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
uh the just to describe the sequence of

uh
 

481
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,949
uh
things that needs to be done to upgrade

482
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
things that needs to be done to upgrade
 

483
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,350

such such solution such complex solution

484
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,360
such such solution such complex solution
 

485
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,790
such such solution such complex solution
at the bridge

486
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
at the bridge
 

487
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,350
at the bridge
so uh it took quite a long period of

488
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
so uh it took quite a long period of
 

489
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,230
so uh it took quite a long period of
time and that's only why why we were

490
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
time and that's only why why we were
 

491
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,470
time and that's only why why we were
able to perform the migration of all of

492
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
able to perform the migration of all of
 

493
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,910
able to perform the migration of all of
our tools

494
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920
our tools
 

495
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,670
our tools
over a short period of time we

496
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680
over a short period of time we
 

497
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,949
over a short period of time we
almost precisely uh met the deadline so

498
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959
almost precisely uh met the deadline so
 

499
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,829
almost precisely uh met the deadline so
uh

500
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
uh
 

501
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,710
uh
there were a few few things

502
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
there were a few few things
 

503
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,710
there were a few few things
just uh that could happen so but uh

504
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
just uh that could happen so but uh
 

505
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,230
just uh that could happen so but uh
the major migration so was done on time

506
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
the major migration so was done on time
 

507
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,230
the major migration so was done on time
and only some interfaces were just

508
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
and only some interfaces were just
 

509
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,630
and only some interfaces were just
rolling out on sixteenths

510
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
rolling out on sixteenths
 

511
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,750

um so what actually uh

512
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
um so what actually uh
 

513
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,230
um so what actually uh
was done uh is that uh the technical

514
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
was done uh is that uh the technical
 

515
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,269

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,910
uh the first question uh is um
why octus why flat cube

698
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
why octus why flat cube
 

699
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,870
why octus why flat cube
um

700
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880
um
 

701
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,790
um
that's a few comments about this uh so

702
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
that's a few comments about this uh so
 

703
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,710
that's a few comments about this uh so
first of all uh

704
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,720
first of all uh
 

705
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,350
first of all uh
after the abandon of the network itself

706
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
after the abandon of the network itself
 

707
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,670
after the abandon of the network itself
so it became obvious that we can no

708
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
so it became obvious that we can no
 

709
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,790
so it became obvious that we can no
longer

710
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:06,800
longer
 

711
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,990
longer
uh live with uh the word tone in the

712
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,000
uh live with uh the word tone in the
 

713
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,790
uh live with uh the word tone in the
name in our product because it was uh

714
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:12,800
name in our product because it was uh
 

715
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,509
name in our product because it was uh
bearing a lot of reputational risks and

716
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
bearing a lot of reputational risks and
 

717
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,590
bearing a lot of reputational risks and
a lot of confusions uh appear from that

718
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:21,600
a lot of confusions uh appear from that
 

719
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,870
a lot of confusions uh appear from that
uh so we had a choice

720
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880

 

721
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,629

several dozens of them
 

817
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,990
several dozens of them
so finally uh

818
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000

are one of the smartest animals
 

843
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,429
are one of the smartest animals
on the earth and if you just

on the earth and if you just
 

845
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,309
on the earth and if you just
look at the other research so they are

846
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:20,319
look at the other research so they are
 

847
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,390
look at the other research so they are
considered the third

848
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:22,400
considered the third
 

849
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,870

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,669
the bridge is perceived
uh flat cube is a bit

870
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:45,679
uh flat cube is a bit
 

871
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,909
uh flat cube is a bit
more different story so uh and um

872
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
more different story so uh and um
 

873
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,110
more different story so uh and um
we always imagined uh having our decks

874
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
we always imagined uh having our decks
 

875
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,590
we always imagined uh having our decks
not just uh as a simple replica of

876
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:55,600
not just uh as a simple replica of
 

877
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,190
not just uh as a simple replica of
unisport or some some other index from

878
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
unisport or some some other index from
 

879
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,510
unisport or some some other index from
from evm world

880
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,520
from evm world
 

881
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,310
from evm world
but rather we wanted to to have it like

882
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
but rather we wanted to to have it like
 

883
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,270
but rather we wanted to to have it like
um

884
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,280

 

885
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,830

hub for different uh different

886
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
hub for different uh different
 

887
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,070
hub for different uh different
activities that the hub that can have

888
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,080
activities that the hub that can have
 

889
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,029
activities that the hub that can have
many faces it can uh this use

890
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:17,039
many faces it can uh this use
 

891
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,190
many faces it can uh this use
used for several different purposes for

892
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
used for several different purposes for
 

893
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,630
used for several different purposes for
launch pads for

894
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
launch pads for
 

895
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,230
launch pads for
other case cases so it's like pretty

896
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,240
other case cases so it's like pretty
 

897
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,270
other case cases so it's like pretty
much like hypercube that's

898
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
much like hypercube that's
 

899
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,750
much like hypercube that's
the technology that we used to have uh

900
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:27,760
the technology that we used to have uh
 

901
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,990
the technology that we used to have uh
never scale but no longer

902
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
never scale but no longer
 

903
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,350
never scale but no longer
uh but uh this is a cube with

904
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:33,360
uh but uh this is a cube with
 

905
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,430
uh but uh this is a cube with
many many faces

906
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,440
many many faces
 

907
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,909
many many faces
and uh but on the other hand uh this is

908
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:37,919
and uh but on the other hand uh this is
 

909
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,909
and uh but on the other hand uh this is
something that can be

910
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:39,919
something that can be
 

911
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,029
something that can be
uh

912
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
uh
 

913
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,029
uh
sticks really simply so this is

914
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
sticks really simply so this is
 

915
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,270
sticks really simply so this is
something as simple as a square so like

916
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,280
something as simple as a square so like
 

917
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,470
something as simple as a square so like
flat cube

918
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
flat cube
 

919
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,750
flat cube
is a square

920
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:47,760
is a square
 

921
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,150
is a square
is one of them one of the

922
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
is one of them one of the
 

923
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,390
is one of them one of the
most famous figures and primitives and

924
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
most famous figures and primitives and
 

925
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,669
most famous figures and primitives and
uh it is uh very simple and easy to

926
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
uh it is uh very simple and easy to
 

927
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,870
uh it is uh very simple and easy to
understand

928
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880
understand
 

929
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,029
understand
so uh and this is actually our creditor

930
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039
so uh and this is actually our creditor
 

931
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,870
so uh and this is actually our creditor
so we try to do our

932
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:00,880
so we try to do our
 

933
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,789
so we try to do our
complex really complex products as

934
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:02,799
complex really complex products as
 

935
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,430
complex really complex products as
simple as possible uh up to the level

936
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
simple as possible uh up to the level
 

937
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,549
simple as possible uh up to the level
uh that even a non-educated user can

938
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:08,559
uh that even a non-educated user can
 

939
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,750
uh that even a non-educated user can
easily understand how to use it

940
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:11,760
easily understand how to use it
 

941
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,190
easily understand how to use it
so yeah we decided that flat cube is a

942
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
so yeah we decided that flat cube is a
 

943
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,070
so yeah we decided that flat cube is a
good name also it is rhythmical

944
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
good name also it is rhythmical
 

945
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,070
good name also it is rhythmical
technically sounding and easy to

946
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,080
technically sounding and easy to
 

947
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,110
technically sounding and easy to
remember

948
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,120
remember
 

949
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,430
remember
and the token as you

950
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,440
and the token as you
 

951
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,669
and the token as you
everyone may have noticed it is named

952
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:25,679
everyone may have noticed it is named
 

953
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,710
everyone may have noticed it is named
cube

954
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:26,720
cube
 

955
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,990
cube
so

956
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,000
so
 

957
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,070
so
it will have its own icon so it's it's

958
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,080
it will have its own icon so it's it's
 

959
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,750
it will have its own icon so it's it's
under developments probably we will have

960
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:31,760
under developments probably we will have
 

961
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,950
under developments probably we will have
some temporary icons just to have it on

962
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:34,960
some temporary icons just to have it on
 

963
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,830
some temporary icons just to have it on
the

964
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:35,840
the
 

965
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,870
the
interface but uh all of our products

966
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:38,880
interface but uh all of our products
 

967
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,070
interface but uh all of our products
will receive the as a unique identity

968
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,080

 

969
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,190

soon

970
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
soon
 

971
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,710
soon
as we used to have

972
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:46,720
as we used to have
 

973
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,870
as we used to have
to say another scale

974
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:48,880
to say another scale
 

975
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,190
to say another scale
but we want them to be really

976
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200
but we want them to be really
 

977
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,390
but we want them to be really
recognizable and easy to remember

978
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,400

wait some time and second way is bring
 

1053
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,950
wait some time and second way is bring
out money

out money
 

1055
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,310
out money
uh because the young network without

1056
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,320
uh because the young network without
 

1057
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,990

recently we also updated the
 

1101
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,549
recently we also updated the
ledger application to support

1102
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
ledger application to support
 

1103
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,470
ledger application to support
the tokens of new standard

1104
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
the tokens of new standard
 

1105
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,390
the tokens of new standard
so currently it is in review and you can

1106
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,400
so currently it is in review and you can
 

1107
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,470
so currently it is in review and you can
already by the way try the ledger

1108
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,480
already by the way try the ledger
 

1109
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,310
already by the way try the ledger
application by yourself by

1110
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,320
application by yourself by
 

1111
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,029
application by yourself by
going to a ledger live application and

1112
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:19,039
going to a ledger live application and
 

1113
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,549
going to a ledger live application and
switching it into the developer modes so

1114
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:22,559
switching it into the developer modes so
 

1115
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,149
switching it into the developer modes so
there you will find since they have a

1116
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:24,159
there you will find since they have a
 

1117
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,430
there you will find since they have a
scale

1118
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:25,440
scale
 

1119
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,350
scale
but uh so we are still uh as sergey said

1120
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,360
but uh so we are still uh as sergey said
 

1121
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,029
but uh so we are still uh as sergey said
so they are expecting from us some

1122
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:31,039
so they are expecting from us some
 

1123
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,870
so they are expecting from us some
interfaces to test the ledger

1124
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:32,880
interfaces to test the ledger
 

1125
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,070
interfaces to test the ledger
application

1126
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
application
 

1127
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,270
application
and uh

1128
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,280
and uh
 

1129
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,549
and uh
we have the integration with

1130
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:38,559
we have the integration with
 

1131
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,990
we have the integration with
ledger sdk at the level of our wallet

1132
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,000
ledger sdk at the level of our wallet
 

1133
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,270
ledger sdk at the level of our wallet
score megaton that you may find our

1134

update it so now the turn is for
 

1143
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,870
update it so now the turn is for
interface team so uh once we finalize

1144
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:56,880
interface team so uh once we finalize
 

1145
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,870
interface team so uh once we finalize
all the stuff linked with the migration

1146

things to be done
so we will update the wallet uh

1154
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:05,919
so we will update the wallet uh
 

1155
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,029
so we will update the wallet uh
correspondingly and provided

1156

correspondingly and provided
 

1157
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,070
correspondingly and provided
for testing to a larger team so and once

1158
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,080
for testing to a larger team so and once
 

1159
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,549
for testing to a larger team so and once
they have it so they will perform the

1160
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:14,559
they have it so they will perform the
 

1161
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,950
they have it so they will perform the
internal security audit so hopefully it

1162
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:16,960
internal security audit so hopefully it
 

1163
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,029
internal security audit so hopefully it
will not take that much time because now

1164

is a

1220
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:29,919

because
 

1225
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,149
because
a lot of our partnerships

1226
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:36,159
a lot of our partnerships
 

1227
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,310
a lot of our partnerships
were under investigation

were under investigation
and

1230
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:39,840
and
 

1231
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,190
and
i think

1232
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200
i think
 

1233
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,350
i think
90 percent plus of partnership will be

1234
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:43,360
90 percent plus of partnership will be
 

1235
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,350
90 percent plus of partnership will be
closed totally

1236
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:45,360
closed totally
 

1237
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,149
closed totally

partnership model that was used in the
 

1833
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,349
partnership model that was used in the

obliging them to to perform
and this is one of the reasons why this

1844
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:02,880
and this is one of the reasons why this
 

1845
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,349
and this is one of the reasons why this
model didn't work and

1846
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:05,359
model didn't work and
 

1847
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,069

00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:10,320
things like um
 

1851
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,310
things like um
locking uh for

00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:12,320
locking uh for
 

1853
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,069
locking uh for
the

1854
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:14,079
the
 

1855
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,270
the
partnership

1856
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:15,280
partnership
 

1857
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,069
partnership
fee so for a certain period of time so

1858
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:18,079
fee so for a certain period of time so
 

1859
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,030
fee so for a certain period of time so
and

1860
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,040
and
 

1861
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,950
and
unless you control the money or you have

1862
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:20,960
unless you control the money or you have
 

1863
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,430
unless you control the money or you have
legally buying documents so it's just

1864
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:23,440
legally buying documents so it's just
 

1865
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,710
legally buying documents so it's just
well almost impossible to

they
 

1901
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,950
they
really carefully analyze them and

1902
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:14,960
really carefully analyze them and
 

1903
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,990
really carefully analyze them and
perform due diligence of these projects

1904
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,000
perform due diligence of these projects
 

1905
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,870
perform due diligence of these projects
and

1906
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:18,880
and
 

1907
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,950
and
several of them that were of course

1908
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:20,960
several of them that were of course
 

1909
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,030
several of them that were of course
focused on the other scales i have

1910
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,040
focused on the other scales i have
 

1911
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,670
focused on the other scales i have
received the sa grants

1912
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:25,680
received the sa grants
 

1913
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,230
received the sa grants
at the beginning but there are several

1914
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:28,240
at the beginning but there are several
 

1915
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,230
at the beginning but there are several
new ones that that are coming so and you

1916
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:32,240
new ones that that are coming so and you
 

1917
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,710
new ones that that are coming so and you
will hear the name soon that are real

1918
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:34,720
will hear the name soon that are real
 

1919
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,150
will hear the name soon that are real
really nice and uh

1920
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,160
really nice and uh
 

1921
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,990
really nice and uh
the lights believe that they will bring

1922
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,000
the lights believe that they will bring
 

1923
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,710
the lights believe that they will bring
a lot of value to the network

1924
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:42,720
a lot of value to the network
 

1925
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,670
a lot of value to the network
uh

1926
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:43,680
uh
 

1927
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,390
uh
but

1928
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:44,400
but
 

1929
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,950
but
i would like to remind that this stage

1930
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:46,960
i would like to remind that this stage
 

1931
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,710
i would like to remind that this stage
of the grants program

1932
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:48,720
of the grants program
 

1933
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,270
of the grants program
is the initial stage and it's uh this

1934
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:51,280
is the initial stage and it's uh this
 

1935
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,230
is the initial stage and it's uh this
this is a stage for experiments so

1936
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:54,240
this is a stage for experiments so
 

1937
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,430
this is a stage for experiments so
because we do not yet uh know which kind

1938
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:57,440
because we do not yet uh know which kind
 

1939
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,430
because we do not yet uh know which kind
of projects will bring the most value to

1940
00:38:59,430 --> 00:38:59,440
of projects will bring the most value to
 

1941
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,030
of projects will bring the most value to
the network and

1942
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,040
the network and
 

1943
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,030
the network and
although we already have quite a good

1944
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,040
although we already have quite a good
 

1945
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,750
although we already have quite a good
stream of such projects that are

1946
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:05,760
stream of such projects that are
 

1947
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,870
stream of such projects that are
coming

1948
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:06,880
coming
 

1949
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,349
coming
into the funnel um

1950
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:09,359
into the funnel um
 

1951
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,510
into the funnel um
we would like to scale it much much

1952
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:11,520
we would like to scale it much much
 

1953
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,950
we would like to scale it much much
wider

1954
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:12,960
wider
 

1955
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,710
wider
and uh but to understand better uh which

1956
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:16,720
and uh but to understand better uh which
 

1957
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,910
and uh but to understand better uh which
projects

1958
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:17,920
projects
 

1959
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,069
projects
we need and how to approach them how to

1960
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:20,079
we need and how to approach them how to
 

1961
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,910
we need and how to approach them how to
motivate them to participate in this

1962
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:21,920
motivate them to participate in this
 

1963
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,270
motivate them to participate in this
grant program

1964
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:23,280
grant program
 

1965
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,150
grant program
uh so we need to get some experience so

1966
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,160
uh so we need to get some experience so
 

1967
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,390
uh so we need to get some experience so
and we are getting it now and uh

1968
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:30,400
and we are getting it now and uh
 

1969
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,870
and we are getting it now and uh
i think that's in a few months so uh

1970
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:32,880
i think that's in a few months so uh
 

1971
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,910
i think that's in a few months so uh
after at least a dozen of projects are

1972
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:35,920
after at least a dozen of projects are
 

1973
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,270
after at least a dozen of projects are
approved and 100 is filtered

1974
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:39,280
approved and 100 is filtered
 

1975
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,030
approved and 100 is filtered
so we will be able to make some

1976
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,040
so we will be able to make some
 

1977
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,750
so we will be able to make some
conclusions and

1978
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:43,760
conclusions and
 

1979
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,190
conclusions and
significantly

1980
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,200
significantly
 

1981
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,589
significantly
establish a significantly solid

1982
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:47,599
establish a significantly solid
 

1983
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,630
establish a significantly solid
uh process of grasping

1984
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:50,640
uh process of grasping
 

1985
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,190
uh process of grasping
but until then so it is really difficult

1986
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:53,200
but until then so it is really difficult
 

1987
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,190
but until then so it is really difficult
to speak about roadmap i would like also

1988
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,200
to speak about roadmap i would like also
 

1989
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,790
to speak about roadmap i would like also
to remind that have a scale still a

1990
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:56,800
to remind that have a scale still a
 

1991
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,630
to remind that have a scale still a
young network and

1992
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:58,640
young network and
 

1993
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,150
young network and
this project so we need these projects

1994
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:00,160
this project so we need these projects
 

1995
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,990
this project so we need these projects
more than they need us

1996
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,000
more than they need us
 

1997
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,030
more than they need us
and this is a really pragmatic approach

1998
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:05,040
and this is a really pragmatic approach
 

1999
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,510
and this is a really pragmatic approach
that we can stand and

2000
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:07,520
that we can stand and
 

2001
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,829
that we can stand and
we need

2002
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:08,839
we need
 

2003
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,230
we need
to start being uh

2004
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:12,240
to start being uh
 

2005
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,750
to start being uh

after that so we will be able to scale

2018
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:27,520
after that so we will be able to scale
 

2019
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,870
after that so we will be able to scale
it up and bring some uh some much much

of course
after that there will be the gate will

2134
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:42,960
after that there will be the gate will
 

2135
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,309
after that there will be the gate will
be opened uh not the gate io i mean but

2136
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:46,319
be opened uh not the gate io i mean but
 

2137
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,190
be opened uh not the gate io i mean but
the gate for for a new project so to

them and propose and teach the project
 

2143
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,710
them and propose and teach the project
to be listed and so on so forth

to be listed and so on so forth
 

2145
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,190
to be listed and so on so forth
but uh what we are doing now so we're

2146
00:42:59,190 --> 00:42:59,200
but uh what we are doing now so we're
 

2147

and coop will be number two maybe one
 

2311
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,950
and coop will be number two maybe one
two three on launchpad and we will be

2312
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:16,960
two three on launchpad and we will be
 

2313
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,309
two three on launchpad and we will be
able for all

2314

2377
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,390
i i would like also to add that uh once
uh the tokenomics of the cube talking is

2378
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:34,400
uh the tokenomics of the cube talking is
 

2379
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,430
uh the tokenomics of the cube talking is
ready

2380
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:35,440
ready
 

2381
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,670
ready
to publish so we will share it for sure

2382
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:37,680
to publish so we will share it for sure
 

2383
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,870

just
 

2391
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,710
just
you can uh for now try to guess what

2392
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:46,720
you can uh for now try to guess what
 

2393
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,710
you can uh for now try to guess what
will be in the tokenomics documents for

2394
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:48,720
will be in the tokenomics documents for
 

2395
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,829
will be in the tokenomics documents for
for the keep talking and

2396
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:50,839
for the keep talking and
 

2397
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:55,670
for the keep talking and
uh i i i can just uh give a price to the

2398
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:55,680
uh i i i can just uh give a price to the
 

2399
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,349
uh i i i can just uh give a price to the
ones who

2400
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:57,359
ones who
 

2401
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,589
ones who
will guess the most precisely how it

2402
00:47:59,589 --> 00:47:59,599
will guess the most precisely how it
 

2403
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,630
will guess the most precisely how it
work and which features uh will appear

2404
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:02,640
work and which features uh will appear
 

2405
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,109
work and which features uh will appear
there so the one who will

2406
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:05,119
there so the one who will
 

2407
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,150
there so the one who will
just guess the more precisely uh what

2408
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:08,160
just guess the more precisely uh what
 

2409
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,910
just guess the more precisely uh what
will be in the tokenics and how it will
