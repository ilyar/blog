hi everyone
so let's just wait one more minute
then we'll start
hello everyone
hi
okay
let's begin
so welcome everyone it's our 53rd weekly
defined governance call
so we have a very interesting agenda for
today so and
hopefully
some discussions so
so we will start traditionally with
contest updates and then switch to the
next topics
uh so
actually we have uh
two contests uh which are currently in
the voting stage the first one is a
decentralized launch pad architecture
and design
that uh there are three days left uh to
vote so and so there are a lot of uh
good demos prepared by the participants
and uh some of them are joining today to
answer the questions from jurors if any
but
hopefully hopefully we will have some
discussions about the distress in spite
and the second one is the free tone dex
implementation stage three which was
prolonged once again because we didn't
collect the quorum uh but hopefully now
i see that there are at least 10 votes
for each submission and that means that
we have a quorum finally
and in four days the voting ends and
then we will move to the uh
distribution of prizes so which is very
very good for the participants
uh the contest of three tons of
sovereign identity stage two uh has
ended uh congrats to winners and uh the
payouts for this contest and for the
oracles
was performed uh
late last week
so
finally the prizes just found the happy
happy owners happy winners uh so
congrats again uh so and uh
what's next actually so we are waiting
for the finalization of the dex contest
so which is the last stage of the
uh freeton dex contest and then we will
move further to the security audit of
the solutions but it will not be done in
this specifics of governance but rather
in format one
so i really appreciate
wait you guys would have developed the
solutions for this contest to
go to the formats of governance and ask
them to to
run the audit and i will also help you
with this
uh uh as for the free terms of sovereign
identity stage three uh the contest is
currently in the preparation and uh
hopefully uh some draft will be
published next week so currently
uh everyone who can do this the uh
in lisbon at uh different exhibitions
again so
uh i myself and this time stayed at home
but uh there are some freaking good
written agents working in the fields
uh so and so once they are back so we
will be able to finalize the third stage
of the free transfer ssi contest
uh for the decentralized launchpad so
after the
architecture uh is selected so we uh i
personally didn't have a chance yet to
deeply look into submissions and
it's still
this pleasure wait for me for tomorrow
uh but i believe that there are some
good and interesting approaches so when
we may select several of them for the
implementation stage
so we will discuss this next week
definitely
do you have any questions
at this point
on the contest updates please
three two one nothing okay so let's move
to the next topic uh this is something i
personally was asked frequently so uh
and
the
most of questions uh started appearing
over
last i think three weeks
so the question is simple how do i get
uh
into the
tone swap official token list
uh
it is not an easy question frankly
speaking because uh we have
some uh commitments before uh liquidity
providers the future
providers who are coming to freetown and
we negotiate with different projects uh
and at the same time we do not want to
overwhelm
the interface so uh we have prepared the
official procedure
on how a project can get to the tonsil
so uh just to make a long story short so
uh i will not read out the whole
document so uh it will be shared right
after that if i call
um
there are some conditions actually uh
for for a project to appear in the
official list
uh we the least will be limited so there
will be
no more than uh 50 uh projects at at
that time so this is pretty pretty
similar to what uni swap does
and we are gradually moving towards uh
having a fully scalable dow photon swap
that will uh later uh take decisions on
which project to write list which one uh
not
uh so uh that means that the room is
limited actually in this list and uh
you will need to comply with certain
requirements for of your project which
uh
well to make a long story short it is
the project should be live uh and it
should provide enough liquidity and
activity to the transform
uh
all the rest is just lyrics and uh
there are some just reasonable points so
i think i'm sure that you will uh read
it in the document
and the form uh
for
application of pro of projects is uh
already created so it's just simple
google form
where you provide a generic information
about your project and
if you have any questions so we will
create a dedicated uh contact group
so and
we have gathered a group of
uh experts who will assess your project
and decide on whether or not
it should be on the list
uh there's there will be a competition
between projects so meaning that this uh
not a one
time task to get on this list and so you
must maintain your project you must
demonstrate the activity uh in the town
swap
and the best of the best projects will
stay on the list
later on so
we
may add additional token lists that will
be maintained by reputable uh
institutions in the market uh again this
is not nothing new
this is uh pretty much how uh major
projects uh major indexes operate in the
market meaning sushi swap unisport
pancake and others
so uh there will be customized token
lists that you can connect to the decks
for your audiences and of course
you can already create your
liquidity pools
and so on so forth and just get a direct
link for your audience if you want them
to trade on the
on the transfer
time to time we will be revising uh the
projects that are currently operating on
the turn swap
and
we may uh ourselves approach the project
if you see it it's been successful and
we may decide to include it on
ourselves uh so
that's that's pretty it's so it's it's
it's that simple
so uh
i will ask guys to just roll out the
announcement and you will have the all
the links to the documents and
you can ask any questions please feel
free
to myself or here in the defy group
so i i expect a lot of questions please
raise your hand
really yeah okay yeah please alex
uh yes
what advantage
uh will be for the project will be
received uh on transform i know it can
swap and
the famous of the project is
a big advantage to another project but
what maybe other advantages uh will be
for the product which be
at least feed rewards or some i don't
know maybe marketing marketing and so on
yeah
actually
thank you thank you for the question so
uh it's it's very easy so uh currently
turn swap is uh
the decks with most of the liquidity so
uh within the free tone network and if
you if your project wants to be a part
of this likability and wants uh to be
visible uh in the
on in the swap and in the
farming section as well
uh so uh
he needs to be on uh what listed on the
official token list uh moreover for uh
some projects that uh
have a very well done business model and
uh
which have the audience
the such projects can contact uh defy
lines
in in frames of the crystal handshake uh
program and get also the co-farming
funding uh that will uh just
boost their um
liquidity inflow and as a value for the
users
uh but this is should be done and it's a
separate process uh the main thing is
that
we apply currently a lot of efforts for
promoting tone swap
across not only uh
free tonica system yeah so we also
approach a lot of different media and
top leading media meaning that we want
to put ton swap
on the same page as uh
major major decks from other blockchains
uh and if you get listed there so uh it
means that you will be visible to
all this newcoming uh
audience and liquidity and so on so
forth and of course if you uh want and
you have some special projects you want
some co-marketing or whatever so yeah
please you can always
contact me and my team and
we're open for discussion
thank you very much and it can be
every project with
which
has strong technical background
strong technical marketing
[Music]
good audience
good business model so we will just uh
can you mute please because i hear
myself
uh yeah this is this the main criteria
for us is that this project should be
really something that is demanded by the
audience
because there is no reason uh to list a
project just for the sake of listing uh
the main reason is that we want uh taunt
swap to be
live
and actively used
because this is good also for our
liquidity providers who start earning on
the exchange commission uh
this is also good for the project itself
because because it becomes more liquid
uh
and
yeah in general this is good for all the
free tone because we popularize
different projects
who
are successful within the free tone and
we will also highlight those as that
are growing really fast
thank you very much thank you welcome
welcome
who's next
yeah yeah
sorry
sorry okay
okay another questions
uh okay so no questions in this case so
i'll ask uh my guys just to distribute
the announcement and you will find all
the links to to the procedure itself and
to the application form so it's it's
very easy so actually and just
uh
make sure to fulfill the preconditions
for what listing and then submits your
application so we are not very
bureaucratic the only thing is that uh
part of the of the
of the listing team uh
is uh the device uh are members of the
development team of the trump swap so
and uh
typically we will collect as
applications until the first day of the
next month
and then process all the applications
all together
within a frame of two weeks so
hopefully we will see first listings the
early next next months
okay so let's move on
the next topic is a decentralized launch
pad tma session so uh
i gave the opportunity to jurors and
participants to to discuss in one place
uh so we have created a dedicated group
so where only the participants and
jurors are present
and uh participants so uh
preparers very very good demos so and i
really appreciate this and thank you so
so much for
with your productivity and
responsiveness
and uh now let's just move on if if any
jurors are here and they have any
questions to participants so please
start raising your hands
uh and just for the sake of of the
format so let's start
going
submission by submission so submission
number one
which is just let me open the contest
just give me a second
the interface is not that fast
all of you guys is the first submission
just raise your hand
maybe it will be faster
okay so presented i guess
sorry
not presented i guess
uh probably not presented okay
so uh this is actually the submission of
40-foot
project if i'm not strong
uh yeah it seems like this
does anyone uh
have
any questions so let's at least fix them
here so raise your hand please
but we don't have anyone who answers
them right so what's the point
okay okay in this case so just drop the
questions uh in the chat
so uh
okay no one
uh
the second submission is uh
there is no contact information in here
in the submission itself
and no naming for launchpad
uh yeah i'm here from the submission on
a submission to sorry
okay jaroslav nice to meet you okay guys
do you have any questions to your slav
please
three two one no okay there's love your
work is clear and clear now
but but but i definitely expect that you
will start getting some questions closer
to the voting deadline that's typically
how it works so just be please be aware
and
just in the last day of the submissions
submission voting
uh normally it happens the jurors start
voting in the last day
okay thanks okay okay thank you uh
the third submission is uh the killer
rail podcast yeah amity is here so guys
if you have any questions to meet here
so uh some of you may have already even
participated in the in this
event that they hosted uh earlier this
week
so if you have any questions please read
your hands
again
no no one okay
media everything is clear for guys i
hope so like i did uh killed like half
an hour and just trying to you know put
a video on and
brilliant
brilliant okay okay thank you so much
let's go to the first one mvc of the
centralized launchpad uh is the author
is here
there's also no contact information
inside of the page um what maybe instead
of just going one by one maybe we will
ask anyone is anyone have any question
about yeah absolute mission
good good good question long time now
just don't see anyone having any
questions
yeah
so every submission is completely clear
there are no questions whatsoever you
see
absolutely
okay
in this case so uh let's just move on so
uh
yeah thank you so much
and look um
so uh let's move to the questions that
uh
ilya has posted in the defy group so uh
actually i'm not sure that i i will be
able to answer uh all of them because uh
sergey uh who was willing to participate
unfortunately didn't manage to to do
this because he's
deeply in the meetings in lisbon
so let's let me try it
tell us about the burning of three
billions when how all at once uh
actually
when
uh
definitely this year so uh
how so we didn't decide yet but maybe
mita can propose because he has already
uh have some ideas about how to do this
because typically these either send into
some
address
that will never be used uh but maybe
media can propose something additionally
so good to have him here
meet him
in terms of burning tokens
yep turn to increase three billion
return crystals
[Music]
yeah well we can like
there are a few things we can do i think
we can send it to
[Music]
to an address that will have a smart
contract
that
then
will have no like and then make a set
code to the smart contract which will
delete the keys and uh
and that will be provably
like uh address where
the tokens will you know will not be
able to be returned like if you read the
code
like it should be burner burner smart
contract that's what basically i'm
saying
so anyone can
you can see that this code cannot be
executed to withdraw any money from
there ever
okay i think that's the kind of probably
the only way to do that on free time
right so we create a locker contract
burn our contract that burner contract
and and we publish the code should be
really simple everyone could see that
and we deploy this code
there can be funky stuff done with the
address like um you know
you can
i don't know play with it with the code
to make a hash like i don't know nicer
and
yeah because i will ask the question i
will answer the question why not just
simply to send it to zeros well because
these are system smart contracts and
nobody knows
who
had maybe the key from this address just
didn't deploy it on the deployment of
the network like you
it will be much harder to prove
that this is impossible because like you
need to go into read the specs of the
whole blockchain to see if it's
impossible or not
um
but um
but you know um
yeah here
this one is much clearer because there
here's the code read the code
that that's that's the address that's
the code it doesn't happen yeah
absolutely absolutely
yeah we can mine some some nice address
so we actually uh have a tool for just
mining some beauty
beauty addresses
our github as well
so uh
we can just adapt it
after the the contract is ready so we
can just run it for i don't know one
week
and see
[Music]
if we manage to at least mine a good
nice looking address
uh but it's not important that's all so
you can have some
any address almost so just but with the
right contract deployed on it
thank you media so um
the second question is that the fire
alliance announced its goals to bring
creton to the top hundred uh is a
timeline for this goal year and five
yeah actually this is uh our ambition
until the end of next year uh to enter
the
top 100 of coin market cap
by valuation
and uh to do this so there are a certain
amount of work needs to be done and and
enough
liquidity
locked in the network because such
liquidity will mean that uh there is a
life interest for ton crystals and
this can just push the uh
the token price up and also help us to
[Music]
improve the valuation of the project
currently uh
we are at the
260 some place
if i remember it well maybe something
changed but at least we are in the top
300 which is very good
uh and yeah
earlier this week we finally got the
official valuation of
our
of our project by coinmarketcap so that
was a challenge
uh so yeah the answer is uh uh until the
end of next year
uh explain the motivation for potential
startups and partnerships to move to
free free tone um
that actually
really depends uh on
uh on the project itself so on how they
perceive the network
but typically when we uh are doing the
business development so we are saying
about the uh hot
hot features of friton named like this
so i mean the speed and low gas fees and
also scalability
and all other things that we put in
uh inside the new brand name
but also this this means uh that
uh we are talking about the ecosystem
that is currently uh
being born and a lot of patients
community members
uh that are expecting those projects to
appear here and
the
the main thing here is that uh
not everything is
just attracting projects uh only by some
rational reasons they also see uh
look at the popularity of the protocol
they see at the market in the force
about what is written in media about
what is said by the community members so
uh
not everything depends purely on on our
business development you know that means
that
you as a community member can also do a
lot a lot to attract those projects just
by going to the uh to their sites
to the uh official chat groups and uh
just
discussing about the the
why free tone is great so and uh if you
are here so probably you are convinced
so just just think about what convinces
you that three thousand grant
and uh probably this is the same reason
why other projects will come here
so uh
yeah so i hope i managed to answer maybe
sergey will just add something next week
by the way he uh already said to me that
he's ready for an ama uh a regular ama
session next week so uh if you have any
other questions so please prepare them
for the next weekly call
uh
when will you do farming the boat uh
well
that's a question so um
we have quite a limited capacity now so
because as you may know we are
strongly focused now on uh rolling out
the missing features of the
friton bridge and
to evm networks uh there is still a lot
a lot of work to do and we uh
unfortunately have uh quite tight
schedule and our roadmap
strongly planned until the end of the
year
uh and i'm not sure that we will be able
to even approach this task this year but
on the other hand we all of our
contracts are open sourced so and if
you're willing to help us with building
such a deport so yeah free to do this so
please
uh
will the crystal wallet support the bots
uh not likely because uh crystal wallet
is not a chat client uh like surf for
example so
you already have debug support in the
serve so feel free to use it please
uh
stepan comments have shared information
about the financial system of the bridge
if there is anything else to say we will
listen with pleasure
we are currently preparing the light
paper of the bridge
i hope that we will be able to release
it soon so it's not a full white paper
like like
a
philosophical document about the mission
of the bridge but it's
a document that concentrates on how the
breach works and and why
uh
it it will be success successful and uh
it also contains some uh
highlights on how the economical system
works so
i think that stephan shared with you
uh almost
everything uh that is that is crucial
and some things are coming so i'll just
keep them secret for now because
uh they will
just
be
something that no one has done before so
and
they think maybe successful maybe not
but at least we believe that it will be
a really good solution as it can be used
uh by other projects
uh in the year's perspective what would
be more profitable uh bridge taking of
farming and bridge pairs so we're not
giving investment advice sorry guys
we cannot recommend you anything so just
uh educate
in terms of financials and
just make your own calculations and your
own judgments so uh
yeah we cannot and will not
anyhow
uh affect your
your decision in terms of investments
uh explain what kind of stupid mechanics
tip three is why it turns out that each
project has has its own tip three how it
works
isn't this a problem well uh
to say uh and comment on that yeah
i i will give you
sure
so uh actually uh
we are being born currently so we are
not the project that has a solid
background already and thousands of
projects launched and whatever so uh no
one says that
this or that implementation of tip three
is
the most rightful one
each one implementation has some
rationale behind it so uh
in roxas for example so uh our
implementation of t3
was mainly
born together with the breach so and the
requirements of the breach to function
and consequently when we were building
town swap as well uh so we
added some extra features to to
to the standard like gas management or
wallet deployment in the process of
talking transfer
just because
we made thousands and tens of thousands
of different tests and we
personally met uh certain problems with
using just euro vanilla uh tip three
specifications that was proposed by
media so uh that doesn't mean that uh
other implementations are good or bad
so uh they are just using different
products and uh one day probably so we
will just try to unify them but until
then we won't
please just remember this is a this is a
distributed programming paradigm in
which yeah the whole point of tip three
is that it's a distributed token it
doesn't have a hash map
of the owners and that means that the
contract is very tiny and they should be
tiny
and um
sometimes you need to implement uh like
a lot of additional features on top of
the the tip3 contract itself and these
features
they
require separate interfaces right so
what you would do in ethereum you would
create like an a hash map and then just
add all the interfaces you would
possibly need to that this is impossible
to do because in that
what that will create a monstrous uh tip
three wallet contract which will be
deployed for each
of the of the owners individually which
is not feasible well first of all the
network just that right now it has 16
kilobytes
limit of the of the contract size
uh message in the deployment so like if
you want to deploy this contract fast
and not create any funky mechanism of
deploying and then setting the code and
then adding to that
which is a nightmare by itself you just
don't do that in the point is that we
don't need a unified standard
because
because there is no problem in having
creating you you create a tip three
token for your project for example in
flex in breach it was one thing that
proxies needed to add like in interfaces
and then flex is completely other thing
that we needed to add and we we choose
to add that and drop some other
interfaces so it will be tiny contract
in the gas payment for that will be
small and the deployment will be in one
message and so on and so forth the same
thing goes for every project that you
you want to use tip three
so
tip 3 is not a standard in this
normal like in the ethereum kind of way
it is a it is a way to program and you
can add interfaces and you need to
describe these interfaces in the tip 3
documentation
but you don't need to actually have all
the
tokens to have the same interface so how
do they talk to each other well it's
very simple through wrappers and it's
really simple to do
and it's there is no problem to take one
token and one in the bridge talking and
make it if and make it tradable on flex
and of course we
we already have that contract written so
we will demonstrate it when the flex
will go out it will trade
tokens which which you post on swap or
in breach no problem
because when you want to do that you
just send one message to the contract it
will wrap one talk and give you another
deploy the pair that's it
because the gas fees are so small in
freetown there is simply no difference
and it would be it's actually
economically more feasible to do is
through the wrapper if you collect and
you combine all the fees
then the fees that your huge hashmap
with all that were hashmap all the
contract with all the interfaces would
pay because for every interface you pay
right because you store them
right so
so if you combine all these fees
together
it is cheaper to wrap than just just for
the so from every perspective you look
at this in the sharded architecture like
friton if you wanted to scale infinitely
you need to follow this
programming paradigm if you follow this
programming paradigm you look at the
contract specifications and
standardizations different way okay
that's it
okay thank you lisa
so i i hope that that answers your
question
uh
yeah i hope that they at least managed
to to give some clarity on your
questions
yes yes yes i need to write it one more
time in the forum i think or something
so we can
probably
uh okay um
any other questions guys please
link to this
yes zachary please
[Music]
thank you thanks for that and meteor to
explaining the token contract and just
want to be specific now for our project
which is a tango
and we're trying to issue the our
in-game token
and the thing says according to media
then we basically can just write a
contract based on
the existing tip three
uh standards right and when the flex is
ready then we can basically just write a
wrapper on top of it
yeah exactly exactly
if i'm the strong media already has the
rubber from
brock's slippery
yeah so miti if you can drop the link
maybe to suit a wrapper
i will yeah you just send the send the
con yeah
there and and
and then that's it
okay okay
uh so so we we can't have the wrapper
standard that's right uh
from a link
or we need to send the contract to you
no you you you can change
yeah it's already in place in fact so uh
you can just use the builder for example
for convenience and then if you need to
publish also you're talking on flex you
need to provide this wrapper with you
like you need to create the wrapper so
you take the wrapper you put your code
of your contract inside this wrapper
and we will write some readme okay
okay thank you thank you yeah welcome
welcome zachary
any other questions guys please
okay
uh in this case just uh
as the
last point so a minute of shameless
self-promotion so we finally managed to
release
our first mobile versions of crystal
wallet so uh the main uh challenge was
to
to fight with uh
apple and google uh
stores
support because it was a nightmare
so but finally we managed to do this and
says
well it's uh in store so and we really
appreciate if you provide us with your
feedback so uh
just in the ton crystal wallet uh
telegram group so we are eager to hear
that because we already know about some
some issues but they hopefully they're
not critical that just mostly of the
linked with interface
and
at the next step we plan to implement
the multi-signature support and external
account subscription like in the
chrome extension
so if you have any ideas or demands so
don't hesitate to drop them in the group
so we are carefully listening to all the
feedback and just putting this in our
roadmap
and hopefully when they will implement
it
yeah so thank you
uh okay so uh that's pretty for today's
agenda so if you have any other open
questions so please raise your hand
okay seems nothing uh in this case thank
you everyone for attending so well it
was a really pleasant interesting
discussion for today so i wish you a
nice weekend and see you all next week
at the same time
see ya
okay see you
thank you bye
