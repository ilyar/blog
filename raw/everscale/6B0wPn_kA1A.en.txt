And so Greetings today to all of our
ama session Today the
Bali team is visiting us
guys prepared a great post about
how they plan We integrate a
very interesting project for the system as a
whole I
wanted to give the floor to the team immediately the
team will answer will show meditation then
answer the community question so
Ivan let's  I’ll start then Hello
everyone hello everyone the
guys asked you to start the day, but
unfortunately I didn’t have time to come up with it I hope
no one was upset I also hope that
everyone stocked up on delicious tea in a good
mood Today we will raise the curtain
and immerse you in the Secrets of our Universe,
but first I will draw your attention  for the fact
that we are having a small Contest in
which you can collect a unique
collectible pain card. To
do this, you just need to
subscribe to our social networks and at the
end of our drink ask interesting ones
with the hashtag
ballet ama
now I want to introduce
you to our team members this is woogie our
creative director
Ivan architectural Lead of the project and of
course Danila Solovyov,
our inspirer of the project, you have the floor
Hello everyone My name is Danilov I sat down with the
project  years
ago, IKEA
created the largest
city in the world, the city of Toronto
We created a quarter of this city and
converted it into a game
engine  stops I know what kind of
apartments I visited there
none of them
is a very cool project but the government
because we have a back office located in
here in Indonesia we got out by the local
government and offered us to
switch to Indonesia with its
unique laws and the opportunity
so on April 14 we  joined the
city
toronto history to the island of Bali as a
pearl of
Indonesia
Why tell you
well Guys all hello once again I
have already been introduced but actually in
the bolitwin project I am
creating worlds trying to saturate our Meta
universe not only with some
cool game mechanics but also
meaning in the form of an interesting narrative, in
general, if possible, I will also demonstrate the
screen a little and entertain you with stories
So
share the screen for a start, probably
someone from those present is interested
In general, what is it that hurts Well, that is,
not everyone got acquainted with our
presentation materials,
this is a large-scale gaming platform
built on modern  technologies and
inspired by rich cultures We are
fully technology i.e. We want
to give players the opportunity to explore the
vast, truly vast video game
world equal to the whole island and at the same time
enjoy photorealistic graphics
that are
not rendered on their computers A on a
remote server A and  m, a picture is already sent.
Therefore, you don’t need to have
some super powerful video card,
a smartphone is enough,
so
if you disassemble its components,
you can first show a few pictures,
here’s the actual place of graphics examples, we
have already digitized real locations brought
them into the game And at the moment
we are switching to a digital island, that is, we are switching  from one territory
to another and we are
implementing the whole thing with the help of our technologies,
that's what it is in general if you take it apart into its
components, this is a story MMORPG That is,
it's straight Open World where players can,
that is, receive quests,
interact with each other
socially and, most importantly, we go through a
fascinating story  all players with
great experience and love
story-oriented games and therefore
decided to bring it to our world, since
now most of you know that the Meta
universe is essentially empty worlds in which
there is no any history, we want
to bring this story
also with us  there will be a large digital NFC
marketplace cat  which will allow you to buy and
sell real estate in
Bali with the help of tokens, as well as
monetize the art that
local artisans create here,
digitize, have
fun with all these things that
options are used to.
In addition, we have a very important such a
large Plast
business that we create, we
develop cadastral services, this is
such  A digital catalog of all the real estate
that is here in the coolest format
in which it will be possible to run live
inside the location to look at those places
that you are going to buy
live, just like you
are there Well, of course, we have a
very important social mission - this is an
educational platform That  there is
this very, very rich culture that, in
some miraculous, unimaginable
way, managed to survive inside
Indonesia, a giant Muslim
country that
actually doesn’t
even know the
history of Bali herself, because Bali defended
its culture, it’s like  a country within a
country and what we're doing is digitally
real assets real
existing cultures bring it into the game
right now you remove the mask in front of you
one of these masks let me
stop for a second to show this is the
very mask here in Bali is
very different from the rest of the world  visual
culture their own artists their
own artisans who have
developed a well-defined
identity that is fundamentally different
from what we are used to as
Europeans Americans other
residents of the country
and we are actually preserving the
cultural heritage of Bali right now I mean
we are literally preserving it
because here  for example, the ancient Mask is also
known by a local artist who
created works for the palaces of kings
who are a member of a
centuries-old dynasty that gives its
craft from generation to generation and here are the
objects that they produce, they
decay this mask for 150 years and
other similar masks  which we are
already preparing children's collections and
some of them are made of such
materials leather Or bone or wood and
all this will simply be
completely erased in another 100 years, our idea
is to allow people to
get to know these cultural heritage in a playful way,
not only with  masks but also with
other things literally We are
photorealism in absolutely realistic
graphics very high detailing we
scan a real island we take away its
statues ancient temples
have already mentioned that we have governments
and having this support we got the
green light to go to those
places where usually white people  they don’t let me in at all,
that is, there are some tombs,
temples and so on where tourists simply don’t
get in. We don’t just get in, we
want to make a
living opportunity to give people to visit
these places where they would never be in Bali anyway
some examples of our  graphics Yes, this is the
primary garden that we scan
for example an ancient altar
immediately includes many
deities and
Well, I'll show you a few more
examples, I won't leave any details
actually We want to give people the
opportunity to have fun playing, learn
history, recognize culture and at the same time
also earn money And
finally, then you have a word further
Because  we're talking about interesting things like
money because here a lot of people
are interested in Moscow I
'll just show the rights just for a second This is a sword
Check out this ancient Chris sword these swords are
not found in other parts of the world
Here almost every thing
matters very different and amazing  for
example, the number of bends on this ball
can mean the person who
is currently standing
in front of you if there are three of these bends in front of you This
means that I am a warrior if there are 7 of them, then this is the
guardian of the temple And if there are more than 10-12 and
so on, then this is a person  royal
blood In general, all this is very unique And
this ENT is the whole rich thief of the universe, he
does not require for  in order for us to somehow
come up with it strongly, we are essentially engaged
in the fact that, as archaeologists, we explore and want to
bring it in,
let the players get acquainted with it,
since it is
strikingly different from everything that
everyone is used to seeing, which means that it is
interesting only the gods if they
let out their eyes  and the demons that
exist here,
in general, okay, money
is very interesting, we make
presentations on the island and sometimes I ask the
question
if someone knows what Chris sword is here
on the island and Stas of the listeners raises
his hand 2-3 people and these are people who already
live here
[music]
cultural values are cultu
al values are the most important component o
real estate
pricing because you can buy exactly uni
habited people come here precisely f
r cultures for the community I will descri
e the process in brief  Bali
lands to  the cultural values of trading on the crypt
currency exchange we appreciate and love the islan
this is our home and we want to keep deduc
ions from all these operations and sales
we give out to all parti
ipants in the process including stakes and those
people who create this story so la
d sales go hand 
n hand  with a presentation of the local
environment of which we will tell our
architectural
so Hello everyone And me too oh
[music]
Can I take the screen ball away
[music] the
guys are calling someone they are calling
Let me turn off the extra sound for a second
because
[music]
we  we are in the office we are
still in process And my name is Ivan and
I am thinking about the future in the language of
building game architecture because the guys
mentioned that our
game is in the foreseeable
future of Bali and for me the Meta
Universe is an occasion AND an opportunity
to create a theoretical development model
living environment itself in the very
foreseeable future and this model is based
on a real sample of this  very interesting,
we can digitize the environment, we can
create rules and codes and then
simulate the execution of these rules and
codes of the universe, and in this way we
can turn it into a real
recommendation for improving the environment
today, so we kind of create
one of many social benefits for the island
the paradigm in which
We think about the future
We called post-urbanism a term not
fully defined, in principle, we can
develop it beforehand, and thus
our research even in some way
has academic value what
is post-urbanism this state of the world
when the disadvantages of large cities
outweigh  their magnetism, let's say this is
very coolly demonstrated
pandemic suddenly our cities became super
comfortable places to live what we
did We escaped from them all who could and
learned to work remotely learn
to be treated remotely everything we want can
be either remote or can be
delivered to us I mean we  left the cities but
did not lose their Comfort  And
despite the fact that it was such an external
shock, the urbanization trend
is still very stable and
Bali is a very good case
for extrapolating this trend.
Therefore, in our study, we looked
at the urban concepts of the past
in order to create a digital
archipelago of the future  We study
traditional Balinese architecture and
break it down into elements from which we
make libraries
and also look at what form the
architecture of the future will take and what values
ill this form we study the m
bility structure of the island in order to th
nk about what publi
transport could be in the future  and
how it will actually
change the environment on its own We are studying the
irrigation system and patterned settlement to
look at To understand what the role of water will be
in organizing the settlement beautifully on
island A and In general we have studied the island of the
share across us we have done a huge
cartographic study we have
looked at the social  iohemographic own
to physical own We study the structure of
the ownership structure on the basis of
which we make the aforementioned
cadastral portal That is, an
information product that contains
detailed information about any plot on the
island that can serve as an
analytical tool for
research can be a public
good for transparent management of the
land structure for the local
governments and also for us this is the basis of
ours which the guys will talk about later Thank you
We are going to make money on the sale of
licensing Meta objects are allowed
For various streaming services
such as netflixbc our model
is being built more streaming service
staking system service payments
purchase sale
rent real estate this is what we
are going to
make money with us our team
consists of 40 45 people at the
moment mainly developers
from various areas
We are going to launch
in the market soon Three products  The first one is
Place brand NFC which is preparing to launch
mid to mid or end of July
Perhaps even earlier where we will
show all these objects already in 3D with the
ability to kill to see the smallest
details
to delay what it shows
but you will be able to familiarize yourself with the materials
on our social networks second  the product
is a cadastral plan
We produce all these products based on
the same data, which does not harm the development, the
cadastral plan will show all the lands.
Thus, we have lined up the
opportunity for people from all areas to
invest painlessly and without fear to
buy land for their homes now the
situation is different the third product is a game
that is the first  series that will be released
only next year production of the game
This is a very complex and time consuming process
For sure you know that it takes
years but we will be releasing interactive
shows that will allow you to reveal the ENT through
a script that will take place
on local sites that we will
detail three products in
preparation  the first month already next month, more precisely
this time in our time.
Yes, you know, I was just drawing a line
to possibly pre-empt
people's questions, maybe I'll just now
quickly answer a whole series of questions.
I will
quickly go over them firstly,
these are realistic graphics, that is, it is the
new version of the Unreal 5 engine and
modern streaming technologies
that allow us to make really cool
graphics. Examples can already be seen right now,
in principle, we rummaged around the
screen a little, but I think that we will soon be
launching a trailer for  a trailer to make it
clear exactly how it is All beauty will
look like here we have set ourselves a
global goal our second advantage is
that we create a real copy of a
real island these are unprecedented
cases of such a scale Well,
only online
games about space that procedurally
generated giant territories aspired to such a scale
constellation constellations, we, in turn, have
developed our own
procedural generation technologies that allow you to
quickly
digitize And bring
gigantic landscapes to the engine, our team even
has a geologist who
uses satellite images
to generate height maps for us,
which then brings In general, we have
developed a lot of our own  plug-ins that
allow architectural projects to quickly
convert and transfer the engine and we
really plan to digitize the entire
island, but it's clear that this
will not happen immediately and therefore now we have
started the districts step by step from the kingdom of badung and
this is one of the
nine kingdoms that is located in
Bali and so far  we are transferring various
separate objects such as temples and so
on, now on the screen you see
just a rough auto-dometric scan of
one of the territories that will already be
sold in our marketplace just
think this is a real location that
can be bought for real money and
it  but we already have it digitized.
In addition to this scan, we already have a
full-fledged gameplay piece where
you can run in this location where it is
already in the engine. Here are
also the
advantages include the unique
ENT Bali, that is, anyone can
immerse themselves in culture from anywhere in the
world without simply leaving  at home, here are the
opportunities to buy sell
rent real estate land
art objects is a lot of fun and
also in our project there will be an open
platform for urban architects
that allows you to transfer the complex
architectural design of the engine and
test these ideas of the Meta Universe, that
is, it can really build
some kind of thing inside the engine quickly  I
converted it and show how it will
look like two stages of construction and all
this is repeated graphics By the way, in the
picture, just one of the concepts as it
was going to do not apply to what I am
talking about and it is very important to understand that
we in the project are really worried about the
balance between  modern plate arn
mechanics and traditional game
mechanics typical for large-scale
multiplayer games, we are really
hovering over those situations that are now making noise In the
gaming industry like Diablo, when
game developers make
games that force users
to pay more and more money just
to play at least a little bit  game
We are looking for some balance where it will be possible
to enjoy a cool story
company and at the same time for those who want to
earn money
to do it with the help of various mini-games,
for example, we are now developing a
cool game based on the
traditional bally fun of cockfights,
that is, we will have
cockfights  inside the game, a and e,
since we have a
prosperous bloodless society of the
future, where they didn’t attribute it, we
fight Not the roosters themselves, but their digital
projections that put on VR glasses and
appear in the form of holograms that
can be customized on which you can
put on armor that can beat
with each other And, in general, it’s quite
fun and And it all fits well with Well, the
classic game mechanics, while
this does not affect the main
storyline company, which can be
completed without all this, that is, we
are looking for a balance for classic players and
those players  who came for the money and of
course this is a META Universe with great
social opportunities for players and
brands brands can be
integrated in many ways for us from
the fact that for example a live store can
actually be presented inside the
game being real in stores
located in the same place where  it
is located and we can really
transfer elements of clothing there because
we will have character customization we
will have the opportunity to change clothes change to
put on all sorts of masks and get all sorts of
perks but in general everything that is
familiar to all users of
multiplayer online RPG Well,
something like this if we talk about our
the advantages, probably, and if we talk
about what we  in fact,
we already have such a task that for the
next 5
6 10 it may well develop and
evolve because area by
area mechanic by mechanic we
will introduce new
features for players into the game And what is the
coolest thing players will be able to do all these
features  soak it up without
having to connect to some
online stores where But they need to
download a lot of gigabytes of pas Every
time the developers create new
updates, all these updates will just
immediately appear in
the game.  the mechanics when the player can
beat and implemented it bang It appeared in the
game We released a new series of
interactive series we inserted it
inside the game and the players discovered it
right the next day without
having to download anything
and I think that
in the future We can switch to
others  islands because even right
now we have not finished Bali yet And we
already have a lot of ban  wasps from the
government of the adjacent islands
who offer us to
digitize their real estate for money we already have a
large number of incoming requests from
different hotels that offer us to
bring to implement the universe In general, there
will be something to do for a
long time and the project This
project is not just one day  year
this is a long-term project this is a project
that will develop
and evolve by the end of this year
We want to release mvp That is, just a
basic
version of an already working game that will be
essentially a miniature prototype that
you can already run like a sandbox
enjoy some basic
mechanics and
watch a few episodes of
history  which will talk about the
local Laura and then we will just
gradually introduce more and more new
features stitching the map like a mosaic and the
result of this mosaic will be a complete exact
digital copy of the island of Bali with everything with
all the real estate and
landscape and nature animals all
about  with steel gizmos, I
can say that the presentation is generally
simple. I’m shocked, so to speak, Second Life
at maximum speeds, a good schedule, they also
write comments that Wow,
it’s true
, we still have us here to
eat very tightly, in principle, if we can
tell a little more ground if  there is
time
[music]
companies with which it is possible to build
we already have
established
partnerships that allow
[music
] to stream the game now
for free
it will be mainly partners and bloggers
who will cover
what is happening we will be broadcasting
this year 51 users this is it  well,
thousands of users just at the same time
Maybe there are 50 on the server
and now we will tell you about the economy
economy if anything, you can return to
the presentation  graphics is just
sy  I’m digging the digitized Earth on which we
have previously placed objects and the
basic character is running, here the graphics
will be different. Just as soon as we
finished digitizing the first area, here are
four hectares that we are going to
actually sell.
These are our graphics. The
sense that Putin wanted to say about
tokenbali  throughout the project, tokenbals
have utilitarian functions, some of which
Danila Solovyov previously described. I
want to focus on
some other aspects, such as
the if system with the first one. I think that
everything is clear to everyone.
will be new
it especially lies in the fact that the
user needs to collect a
certain way of property such
as land building of course the temple But the
most important thing is that for successful
operation it is important to
perform daily in relation to the spirits in the form of a
special new
just like the locals have been doing for a
hundred, maybe even thousands of years, but oh
well, let's not get into the details,
let's not take away the details, but let's move on to the
important point of the
Sailor Sky partnership, if we put
aside the uniqueness, scalability of the
speed, the security of the blockchain, of
course, its wonderful  community
we are like
creating a family family in our project And
we are together on the same island and
if I can say so during this time or
make friends with some members of the team
and
at the end I will not dissemble we
are interested in the financial support of the country
to launch a mass scanning of
lands we are growing very quickly for  in order
to develop the vast territory of the
island, which
of
570,080 square kilometers,
in order to develop it, we need to
increase the team and increase
capacity and I believe that together we can
build the future
on this we will all be very happy to
answer all questions
yes guys
What is the best
what we give  Ever Scale Yeah yeah
we dae  we bring our technologies to the
community that will be interested in our
project, we will be able to go this
way together as previously mentioned We are working
with the support of the Indonesian government, in
turn, we will be able to share the
platform of blockchain technology
located inside the ever greater
mass of people on planet Earth Crypto
community How I played  I used to think we
believe that together we can build the
future
Yes, for a second, the population of this Indonesia is
Bigger than The population of many countries in the
world as many as 273 million people live and
now we are actively planning to
promote our project, including through
all possible local
mechanisms, with the support of the
government again  because here everyone is super
interested in learning about the
ballets of a gigantic muslim country
that knows practically nothing else.
That is, they don’t teach it in schools
and, accordingly, everyone also goes here
as tourists and therefore the
government is interested in
sharing this because  in fact, a more
gigantic island is a museum and
in general I think that together we will be able
to learn very cool even more
no one knows,
I found out myself recently talking with our
local producers and people who
help us comprehend the culture of this
island, it turned out that the first thing that children are taught
in schools is to smile  children
sit and smile
for a month, teachers at the end of the day put
sad or happy emoticons on and
then analyze each of their students
and already build a training plan. Therefore,
if you have already been to Bali, remember that
everyone hurts always smiles sincerely
for real.
Thank you for your attention,
you can have more facts if  the question
answers questions, otherwise we can
endlessly tell interesting facts about
Bali
Next question guys tell us a
little about your experiment
before how in general
Well, in principle, they told at the very beginning
about the history of the company, that is, everything. Here are the
technologies that are being introduced now, it
hurts, you can see this. The legacy
of Danilov's six-year work  companies  and Karium, which
was engaged in the digitization of
giant cities and the
creation of Digital cities, that is, the
companies inherited a huge
amount of developments and technologies
that we now actively use and, in
principle, everyone has been working as an engine for more than a
year, and it started with real estate
creating video presentations on a game
engine for
all sorts of giant architectural companies and  companies of
our team we have a star team
told about me and will tell about him
excellent
boogie creators cameramen main
creator of 3D helmet and producer of the film
hardcore first film First person
there is a lot of information about this
Internet
to work for me I personally as a
creative director have enough keys here
great experience in advertising
I understand how it all works inside
as a director I have shot a huge number
of commercials for music videos in
different countries and have written many
different scripts but I also had a chance to
work here is the pride of my
feature films hard  core together as a
card sharper because the film grew out of our
music videos filmed on a mask I can
show which actually I invented
a film was shot that was released in more than
70 countries of the
world, in fact, the topic of masks does not
let me go until now I have digital
masks in Bali
and you can also  to say about most
of the team members
Big projects all came to the project as
baggage in such a way that now Nobody
is studying now embodying a
long Star career
Yes, for a second We have a bathhouse
that is a
professional urbanist architects
who work on many projects in
Moscow studied in different countries and in
general  - he knows firsthand about
urbanism, not from the videos
of some Varlamov, but really
understanding and
realizing how these mechanisms work
and you can continue like this
[music]
will soon fly here By the way, we are
quietly taking everyone to the island here, on the 5th,
two creators will fly to us  graphics
one of them is the one who worked on
Call of Duty
fifth number of
people because we understand the potential of the
project We are very interested
in not just doing something to do
something that will really have an
Impact because the work on which
we cut for the next few years
at least and do not want these few
years  to spend for nothing That is why we
try to hire people
who are stronger than even those who already exist. We are
direct careful selection now, in addition to the
Russian-speaking parts of the team, we are actively
trying to get people
from other countries, since game design and
such things are, in principle, very global
history there are not many great
developers so we are
extremely interested in such personnel and
if you know such personnel, please
share
So let's move on Next question by the
way very pressing questions
first question from Sergey He asks I
bought land real estate in the game
We have several several types
that are being implemented now
when you own not only Wirth rights
real object use real property now we have the
first lands that we sell Through the
cryptocurrency
our token is bigger
that’s why our project
can be well fixed when
the world drinks market
and I guess I’ll add just Denmark We
have different types that is because our
methods are like  if in the future, that
is, we have the very action of the game taking place
in the future, not absolutely all the objects
that are now present in the real
world will be transferred, I mean
this does not apply to some ancient temples,
these will all exactly move, but
some
building that is somewhere  then it
can be located a little different inside the game and,
accordingly, all these digital
lands are somehow coordinated
together with the real owners of these
lands and we will give deductions to the
people who live here who
provide actually for this we
entered into a partnership with the government
very cool very  cool
next next question  with
Max How are you going to add the
universe to the first million people
Well I can even continue the sound wants and
principle Quite a simple question
just a million people is not the limit so
in general we have how we are now explained about
40 minutes a very extensive story that
hits completely different audiences there is an
audience of classic gamers  people
like me who love story-
driven games
this is one audience of 30 years old there are mobile
players who play
telephones they are interested in sandboxes this
audience is much younger there are those people
who live
and there are people who are essentially applied
dead and so interested in buying and
selling real estate to look at a
convenient catalog  digital real estate
This audience of the
story will be attracted through
absolutely different marketing moves and I can
say that in order to promote the
project we will do collabs with various
profile bloggers we will release
pieces of an interactive film in order
to tell the ENT you know  most of the
Meta universes, even including this
Zuckerberg universe, they are not an
interesting audience. Why Because these
are Empty worlds with nothing to do,
these are worlds that do not contain
some interesting grain of history inside themselves and
in order to understand why
some games attract a wide
audience and captivate  for many, many
years, it’s enough to turn to the experience on
custom RPGs like Skyrim; there,
every stone, every twig, every
character has a great run of history;
Kimchiki we
plan to release during the
development of the game, that is, we always
want to give out content and we want to make the
community and we are already doing it
simply by giving
absolute transparency in development, that
is, we will directly show the
development process, tell it to unload
people in stories from the world and in this way
nas  to keep the information field with us
long before we even release
at least a minimally working product,
we have something to tell thanks to
many generations of hospitals that have already
worked hard for us, everything that we need
to take and tell and add
because the history of
the island has already been written by time and
written by people  and we don’t need to invent anything,
we just need to dig
deeper with this, and
people from the Indonesian government are helping us also
Answering the previous question about
recruiting a million people, I will
reveal a little secret that the
company Partner with which the company with
which we have partnered, it
helps us get into  all
indonesian media both internet and
physically printed buildings and television broadcasting
i think you can imagine the number
here who dream of their
own game about their culture and their
country
russia familiar farther out in the world we will definitely
visit all the video game exhibitions
we will definitely do all sorts of
cool roles  iki on the Internet, since
our team has experience working on such products,
we
will continue further with questions.
Roman seems to
see questions. This is that next
week we are launching a channel on which we will
create a
reality show for our project where
we will cover the life of the team,
the development process and, of course, Sacrament
the beauty of this island we are a very
interesting producer But you know this is
cool actually there is already one video by
hand There we reveal in great detail
just how we are going to make it
sore wine interesting for the players Step by
step watch be sure to spend 22
minutes of your time
Next question When  you can play
How much it costs to play and whether the
mass will be available
for the test no it will be possible to get in
in a month and a half for this you need
to become a private investor for this
you can contact
and get access the
game will be launched in December of this year
it will be defective but there will already be
locations there already  will be a lord
maybe somewhere along  run, but of course
I want to note this, you guys understand
that a full-fledged big game has
been in development for a couple of months, so we will
transparently openly release interesting
things that you can study
right now and reveal them step by step
But this will be available
only to our community and those who are with us
whether to invest in one way or another,
this also
answers the question of how we will
attract an audience. This is how we will
, including
giving the opportunity to play even
before everyone can do it
.
make the
game accessible even to those who do not have a
hill of money Where to find
tokens that need to be paid to us in
order to see and learn
something we want to make a low entry threshold
so that it would be interesting to play both for
classic players and those who came to
earn or spend money,
but  there is still a question
Will it be possible to add avatars of
other  the projects
will be from a universe friendly to us, of
course, our
most interesting examples are integrated,
it is also interesting because they work,
you can also enter any computer tablet
using a browser remote
server power to create an ultra-realistic
We work on the same technology that
will
work, including the creation of avatars to
integrate
Well, yes  we will have our own
avatar generator we will do some
cool character styling and
not all content will be compatible with
our game That is, if you bought
some kind of Avatar that looks like a
crumble hedgehog because of Smeshariki This is of course
very fine, but in our game it
will be  it doesn’t look very good, so
we will only include for me what
suits us in style and for
friendly numbers with which we have a
collaboration,
here is another question about the
volume of digitization, that is, how much volume have you
already digitized, because Judging by the
presentation,
quite a huge work,
we are going to the area
our  whether the Baiklan digitizes the vast
Bali lands, we have managed to mention
that
the island of Bali will be the largest
painted location in the world; the
nearest locations to it are 10 times smaller;
very
soon this month we will be hiring
contractors who
will upload history and
local authorities through our service and we will model the
content before releasing it in this
way We need Yes, we
need to understand that we also
use procedural
generation  we
have made our own technologies that allow us
to understand from satellite images Where
are the trees Where are the stones and
we are creating a giant library of assets
that are present on the island That is,
everything from the last stone of the last
Plants and the
base will be generated procedurally And
all the rest of the loca  the divisions are made manually With
love and step by step and Answering directly
the question of how many sets we have already digitized
is actually quite difficult
because there are already a lot of
all kinds of ball masks and other things And now we
have already digitized a gigantic territory of
several hectares and
right now we have already carried out a rough scanner
of a huge but very ancient temple
that we are building, we are just transferring
about the numbers in our plans for digitalization
450 hectares of land now goes along with the
transfer of digital property rights to us
and all documents for these
lands already costs 450 hectares By the way, a
recently scanned temple in which
foreigners are not allowed
you can scan it on our
social networks it was very interesting we were
illuminated the drone was illuminated with holy water
before it could fly over the temple the
process is very jeweler, despite
this we are planning
450 hectares in
the next two months and then come
already switch to large-scale
scanning as a platform
Yes, while we are preparing the technical  ology That
is, for example, our designers,
architects, are engaged in
deconstructing All local architecture
into a parametric constructor, that is,
we take All the typical buildings that
are on the island, temples, gazebos, and
so on. We disassemble them into spare parts and
make generators that will allow us
to assemble others from these spare parts  buildings are
quite exciting, this is a very
time-consuming process that takes
time and after some
development period we will be able to generate very quickly
All local buildings, you know,
in fact, if you take games like GTA,
then running through this open world you
meet
repeating sets and it seems that there are no
real  in real life we have an infin
te amount of variety, but this 
s not so. Having lived in Bali for several months now, I reali
ed that there are a limited numbe
of types of scooters that drive on the roads
there are a limited numbe
of statues of their types, they 
iffer only in their distribution and when 
e collect a large libra
y  We can build more and more
locations many times faster than we do This is
now a
very impressive
method sent another question
about
everdale
what What do you want from Ever gave a
direct question like this guys turn off for a while
that we were all visible to everyone
Here your camera is stuck Always visible
I’m stuck with your
support for understanding participation
If I understand the question correctly,
we are building, including a cadastral portal,
accounting for everything that is in Bali,
which implies decentralized
management, and we need this experience and
integration in order to create an
independent system in Indonesia
, bureaucracy is flourishing, and
people with whom  we are in contact want to
avoid the same same
real estate transactions until you remember
all the paperwork will pass A huge huge
time we can cut it
Here comes and of course the experience
that individual
Excellent Excellent
will help us make it
come true this life
can be better
clarified this question
we can answer
Yes  yes i d  I think that the person
received an answer
more likely We
have an ama session running out I just wanted to
say that the guys are a very cool project
I would really like to see a deeper
integration
since we have a project Our blockchain is very
fast We have multisharding If you
go On air
with a large  number
of people we create for children's blockchain and
please at least duplicate at least
multiply a
large number of users can
withstand
research for more than a month and confirmed
that if we really want to introduce
the
decentralization of the game economy, then
This is an excellent choice
[ __ ] I see
against I see a few more issues
related to construction and NFT straight
in a nutshell, I’ll tell you
in the game it will be divided into several
types, one of them was a constructor, we
dismantled typical
buildings for spare parts and inside the metalwork
it will be possible, as a constructor, like Sims, to
create your own houses, buildings,
huge villas, entire villages, organize
events de  making of them branding
advertising platforms will really be
available huge construction how
many
good examples if you look at
when you can build enjoy here
about the
owners of the
land we answered it
It will also be
possible to upload If you are an architect you
know how to
model  paying commissions Bali tokens
your creation can get
what we build in
recent years,
according to which architects from all over the world
can continue to make architectural
projects in their programs and automatically
integrate
one of the most important components of the fact that
we convert
engineering architectural data
if the hotel has a project
thanks to our converters practically
the universe can automatically load
into place on a
scale with exactly the same dimensions of
these projects metadata
a-a, that is, there is a quantity everything What is
indicated in the project area of the volume of mater
als all t
e data that  in
the most modern project
we can include huge calculations with which we can operate already in the game, deriving
them into different forms and
structures, they still ask me
whether or not it
will be in July now we have a private
round we are preparing
along with all the projects that now
want to be launched
[music  ]
nevertheless, we continue to fully
develop the project, we
continue to
collect investments, nothing prevents us,
everyone can take part in
private
Come to us to bring your money,
they will benefit
looks very suitable suitable project
Thank you
and one more The last question is whether
the government will be against the placement of such
objects  of their objects,
if someone places some kind of
concert or some kind of party or
some kind of building
here, it’s interesting we have such a thing
as karma, the
possibilities are very extensive But if
something happens not According to local
laws or  not
according to the standards that are being designed
now, you will just have a sn  the
level of karma will decrease
in the opposite direction also If everything
goes according to the lore and culture and the
laws that we establish for
architecture, the level of Russia will grow
now a huge plan, therefore to create a
master class we are creating a master class and
standards of what can be placed in
order to find a place  in a
virtual ball,
this will be obvious, we will present it through
training materials through examples
through support,
we called it a master plan and the
design code will not be included and we will have to
follow in order to create an environment such
as we are laying it down, so we will
share this
I personally want a resident I want to build a
resort on Batura Because if we
do this it will be possible
Because if we build a ski resort there
will be a place where absolutely everything is
here The only thing that is missing is a ski resort,
you can build a spaceport It’s not a
problem, just buy yourself some
virtual Earth
Yes, of course you need  understand what we
will still have with moderation  too, but the
system of karma is all these things. That is,
anything can’t be built just like that,
it will be necessary to use
our guides. And then everything is realizable.
Yes, guys.
another
blockchain, like I don’t know how in the game in
the Marvel movie Yes,
everything on other blockchains destroyed us with a click,
unfortunately, guys On this, we will probably
come to an end something to finally
add,
thank you very much for being with us and
Please don’t forget  What is the most
interesting question You can win
collectible nails for this you need to
be subscribed to our social networks and
duplicate the question to the admin in order to
synchronize
Please do not forget to fly into our
social networks to get acquainted with the project
to study our videos more closely And
in general to follow the project, we really
appreciate it, appreciate your  attention and we want
you to be also interested
in addition, we will have a huge
number of  It’s interesting that we
’re going to shoot, we are now like
caterpillars that, before going
forward, stretched up as much as possible in
order to go forward the same distance
and this is coming to our social
networks Thank you for your attention
super thanks guys for such a
presentation
cool project
one of the best
Thank you very much yes
