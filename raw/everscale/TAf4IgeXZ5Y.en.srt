it's a decentralized way
 

271
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,189
it's a decentralized way
to predict

00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
to predict
 

273
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,510

certain events

277
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,150

such event can be for example

278
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
such event can be for example
 

279
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,749
such event can be for example
that we all want

280
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:51,759
that we all want

some building to be built

some building to be built
and we're doing something

and we're doing something
 

285
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,990
and we're doing something
in the prediction market when we say

286
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
in the prediction market when we say
 

287
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,830
in the prediction market when we say
what date this building will be built on

288
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
what date this building will be built on
 

289
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,070
what date this building will be built on
another way to use it for example if we

290
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
another way to use it for example if we
 

291
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,950
another way to use it for example if we
have some politician we don't like

292

have some politician we don't like
 

293
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,029
have some politician we don't like
we can predict the date he's going out

294
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
we can predict the date he's going out
 

295
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,710
we can predict the date he's going out
of office

296
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
of office
 

297
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,150
of office
and we can place a large bet on the date

298
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
and we can place a large bet on the date
 

299
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,309
and we can place a large bet on the date
that it will happen

300
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
that it will happen
 

301
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,070
that it will happen
and if someone predicted correctly the

302
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
and if someone predicted correctly the
 

303
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,110
and if someone predicted correctly the
date

304
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
date
 

305
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,430
date
which this politician for example

306
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
which this politician for example
 

307
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,150
which this politician for example
has ended his beauty duties

308
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
has ended his beauty duties
 

309
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,909
has ended his beauty duties
then this person who predicted it

310
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
then this person who predicted it
 

311
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,029
then this person who predicted it
correctly

312
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,039
correctly
 

313
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,469
correctly
is rewarded handsomely

is rewarded handsomely
 

315
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,830
is rewarded handsomely
for example if we know when

316
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:32,840
for example if we know when
 

317
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,510

in a particular date
and he bet on this date

324

and he bet on this date
 

325
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,350
and he bet on this date
then in return he can get for example

326
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
then in return he can get for example
 

327
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,550
then in return he can get for example
100 million dollars

00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:42,320
would happen i mean so yeah they
 

2025
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,349
would happen i mean so yeah they
colluded

2026
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:43,359
colluded
 

2027
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,349
colluded
collusion yeah yeah it was a collusion

2028
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:45,359
collusion yeah yeah it was a collusion
 

2029
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,430
collusion yeah yeah it was a collusion
um you can call it an attack or you can

2030
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:47,440
um you can call it an attack or you can
 

2031
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,270
um you can call it an attack or you can
call it just just just just

2032
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:49,280
call it just just just just
 

2033
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,670
call it just just just just
you know uh being

2034
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:51,680
you know uh being
 

2035
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,150
you know uh being
um but which whichever you call it they

2036
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:54,160
um but which whichever you call it they
 

2037
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,589
um but which whichever you call it they
basically uh owned a bunch of uh

2038
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:57,599
basically uh owned a bunch of uh
 

2039
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,430
basically uh owned a bunch of uh
validators uh

2040
00:38:59,430 --> 00:38:59,440
validators uh
 

2041
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,150
validators uh
ability to validate and they

2042
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:02,160
ability to validate and they
 

2043
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,550
ability to validate and they
used it against the network because

2044
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:04,560
used it against the network because
 

2045
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,310
used it against the network because
they're

2046
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:06,320
they're
 

2047
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,990
they're
that's what do

2048
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,000
that's what do
 

2049
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,190
that's what do
so uh what this does is it creates a

2050
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:11,200
so uh what this does is it creates a
 

2051
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,829
so uh what this does is it creates a
reward system uh in state a staking

2052
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:13,839
reward system uh in state a staking
 

2053
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,270
reward system uh in state a staking
reward system

2054
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:15,280
reward system
 

2055
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,510
reward system
for those who are not them

2056
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:17,520
for those who are not them
 

2057
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,550
for those who are not them
and in doing so it will essentially keep

2058
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:20,560
and in doing so it will essentially keep
 

2059
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,630
and in doing so it will essentially keep
those particular validators who are not

2060
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:22,640
those particular validators who are not
 

2061
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,470
those particular validators who are not
going to get any part of that reward

2062
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:24,480
going to get any part of that reward
 

2063
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,630
going to get any part of that reward
from being able to validate

2064
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:26,640
from being able to validate
 

2065
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,190
from being able to validate
simple solution and of course over time

2066
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:29,200
simple solution and of course over time
 

2067
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,950
simple solution and of course over time
all of those sticking words they come

2068
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:30,960
all of those sticking words they come
 

2069
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,349
all of those sticking words they come
back into the system um they're returned

2070
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:33,359
back into the system um they're returned
 

2071
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,430
back into the system um they're returned
over a period of time

2072
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:35,440
over a period of time
 

2073
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,230
over a period of time
and problem solved hopefully so that's

2074
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:38,240
and problem solved hopefully so that's
 

2075
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,190
and problem solved hopefully so that's
the idea behind it um i don't know if uh

2076
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:41,200
the idea behind it um i don't know if uh
 

2077
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,670
the idea behind it um i don't know if uh

called ddc if i'm not mistaken

2152
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:02,560
called ddc if i'm not mistaken
 

2153
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,589
called ddc if i'm not mistaken
um

2154
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:03,599
um
 

2155
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,190
um
so they're basically going ahead and

2156
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,200
so they're basically going ahead and
 

2157
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,990
so they're basically going ahead and
doing this so very soon besides uh

2158
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,000
doing this so very soon besides uh
 

2159
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,750
doing this so very soon besides uh
integration at the blockchain level will

2160
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:09,760
integration at the blockchain level will
 

2161
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,030
integration at the blockchain level will
also integrate

2162
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,040
also integrate
 

2163
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,870
also integrate
with the nft standard which i think

2164
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:12,880
with the nft standard which i think
 

2165
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,510
with the nft standard which i think
opens up a lot of opportunities

2166
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:15,520
opens up a lot of opportunities
 

2167
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,510
opens up a lot of opportunities
uh in the you know obviously large
