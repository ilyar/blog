what is dao itself
 

315
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,550
what is dao itself
let's try to describe for them uh the

316
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
let's try to describe for them uh the
 

317
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,830
let's try to describe for them uh the
concept yeah

318
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
concept yeah
 

319
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,150
concept yeah
cool so yeah okay so i think if you look

320
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
cool so yeah okay so i think if you look
 

321
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,870
cool so yeah okay so i think if you look
at it literally decentralized

322
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
at it literally decentralized
 

323
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,550
at it literally decentralized
autonomous organization so there

324
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
autonomous organization so there
 

325
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,189
autonomous organization so there
shouldn't be any centralized control

326
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
shouldn't be any centralized control
 

327
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,550
shouldn't be any centralized control
by right there shouldn't be any

328

by right there shouldn't be any
 

329
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,469
by right there shouldn't be any
centralized control but organization it

330
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
centralized control but organization it
 

331
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,670
centralized control but organization it
should be all

332
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
should be all
 

333
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,469
should be all
um

334

like to add that for me dao is an

420
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
like to add that for me dao is an
 

421
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,790
like to add that for me dao is an
incarnation of

422

back in
 

757
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,870
back in
2016 when this new concept was

758
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
2016 when this new concept was
 

759
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,189
2016 when this new concept was
introduced i was very thrilled at first

760
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199
introduced i was very thrilled at first
 

761
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,350
introduced i was very thrilled at first
and i was a huge fan of what was

762
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
and i was a huge fan of what was
 

763
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,430
and i was a huge fan of what was
happening in the market but

764
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,440
happening in the market but
 

765
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,230
happening in the market but
then

766
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
then
 

767
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,150
then
what happened and shocked a lot of

768
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,160
what happened and shocked a lot of
 

769
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,629
what happened and shocked a lot of
people was the infamous dao hack which

770
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
people was the infamous dao hack which
 

771
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,590
people was the infamous dao hack which
led to

772
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
led to
 

773
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,030
led to
a fork of ethereum network as we know it

774
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
a fork of ethereum network as we know it
 

775
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,230
a fork of ethereum network as we know it
and this put me away

776
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,240
and this put me away
 

777
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,870
and this put me away
at daoist like for years i thought it's

778
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
at daoist like for years i thought it's
 

779
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,269
at daoist like for years i thought it's
a terrible idea it's a terrible idea to

00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
a terrible idea it's a terrible idea to

785
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,069
organizations to manage liquidity and it
really for a long time pulled back the

786
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
really for a long time pulled back the
 

787
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,629
really for a long time pulled back the

do you think that
 

795
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,790
do you think that
dao's as a platform for liquidity

796
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
dao's as a platform for liquidity
 

797

or should it
 

805
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,829
or should it
be purely used for uh managing

806
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:51,839
be purely used for uh managing
 

807
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,189

well i think there is no perfect

824
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,240
well i think there is no perfect
 

825
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,710
well i think there is no perfect
solution first of all clearly there are

826
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
solution first of all clearly there are
 

827
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,629
solution first of all clearly there are
risks

828
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
risks
 

829
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,670
risks
and

830
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680

uh and
 

847
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,150
uh and
there are a lot of projects

848
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,160
there are a lot of projects
 

849
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,629
there are a lot of projects
already happening which are solving this

850
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
already happening which are solving this
 

851
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,509
already happening which are solving this
um

852
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
um
 

853
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,590
um
but we need to also think about kind of

854
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,600
but we need to also think about kind of
 

855
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,590
but we need to also think about kind of
the other way around uh remember the

which was a huge step for us
but um

1026
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,520
but um
 

1027
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,990

this voting is efficient
because we also experience these

1034
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,120

1035
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,909
because we also experience these
problems of overflooding of proposals

1042
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,480
and bad examples as well when you think
 

1043
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,630
and bad examples as well when you think
it doesn't work it doesn't make sense

1044
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
it doesn't work it doesn't make sense
 

1045
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,990
it doesn't work it doesn't make sense
and dao just complicates the things

1046
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,000
and dao just complicates the things
 

1047
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,750
and dao just complicates the things
so let's maybe start from straight

1048
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:31,760
so let's maybe start from straight

we cannot expect dao to solve all our

1206
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,280
we cannot expect dao to solve all our
 

1207
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,630
we cannot expect dao to solve all our
problems right

1208
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:20,640
problems right
 

1209
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,310
problems right

nft is just an ft you cannot solve

1214
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:26,159
nft is just an ft you cannot solve
 

1215
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,750
nft is just an ft you cannot solve
everything right so i think dow the same

1216
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:27,760
everything right so i think dow the same
 

1217
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,950
everything right so i think dow the same
thing right you cannot expect dao to

1218
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:28,960
thing right you cannot expect dao to
 

1219
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,070
thing right you cannot expect dao to
come and solve all the government

1220
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,080
come and solve all the government
 

1221
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,669

problems and regulatory problems and

1222
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:31,679
problems and regulatory problems and
 

1223
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,350
problems and regulatory problems and
governance problems i think it's just

1224
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360
governance problems i think it's just
 

1225
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,710
governance problems i think it's just
more about movement and people get

1226
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:34,720
more about movement and people get
 

1227
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,549
more about movement and people get
together i think that that is the core

1228
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:36,559
together i think that that is the core
 

1229
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,870
together i think that that is the core
of it right uh i i think it's what many

1230
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:38,880
of it right uh i i think it's what many
 

1231
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,190
of it right uh i i think it's what many
changes now i mean all this movement has

1232
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,200
changes now i mean all this movement has
 

1233
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,029
changes now i mean all this movement has
been here for a long time but it's just

1234
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:43,039
been here for a long time but it's just
 

1235
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,950
been here for a long time but it's just
that because there's money in here then

1236
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:44,960
that because there's money in here then
 

1237
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,710
that because there's money in here then
suddenly you become a dow right

1238
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:46,720
suddenly you become a dow right
 

1239
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,070
suddenly you become a dow right
that's where the term dow comes from

1240
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,080
that's where the term dow comes from
 

1241
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,230
that's where the term dow comes from
then but i think dao exists on the

1242
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240
then but i think dao exists on the
 

1243
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,710
then but i think dao exists on the
blockchain maybe i know maybe homework

1244
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:52,720
blockchain maybe i know maybe homework
 

1245
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,230
blockchain maybe i know maybe homework
there you know our government will exist

1246
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
there you know our government will exist
 

1247
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,510
there you know our government will exist
on a dao i don't know whether it could

1248
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:55,520
on a dao i don't know whether it could
 

1249
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,430
on a dao i don't know whether it could
happen that would create a lot of

1250
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
happen that would create a lot of
 

1251
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,590
happen that would create a lot of
removal a lot of uh you know issues in

1252
00:22:59,590 --> 00:22:59,600
removal a lot of uh you know issues in
 

1253
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,110
removal a lot of uh you know issues in
our government yeah

1254
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,120
our government yeah
 

1255
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,430
our government yeah
yeah you know speaking of problems that

1256
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:03,440
yeah you know speaking of problems that
 

1257
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,710
yeah you know speaking of problems that
dao's tried to solve we discussed the

1258
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720
dao's tried to solve we discussed the
 

1259
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,110
dao's tried to solve we discussed the
management we discussed the voting

1260
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
management we discussed the voting
 

1261
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,190
management we discussed the voting
but another particular interesting use

1262
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:11,200
but another particular interesting use
 

1263
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,830
but another particular interesting use
case is when dao is used to

1264
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:13,840
case is when dao is used to
 

1265
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,669
case is when dao is used to
distribute dividends

1266
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:15,679
distribute dividends
 

1267
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,549
distribute dividends
um

1268
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:16,559
um
 

1269
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,430
um
and

1270
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:17,440
and
 

1271
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,909
and
eventually it drives the prices of money

1272
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:19,919
eventually it drives the prices of money
 

1273
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,750
eventually it drives the prices of money

what do you think is it like

1278
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,280
what do you think is it like
 

1279
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,149
what do you think is it like
a

1280
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159
a
 

1281
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,630
a
way of market manipulation or is it a

1282
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:32,640
way of market manipulation or is it a
 

1283
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,230
way of market manipulation or is it a
good way of promoting the whatever token

1284
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:36,240
good way of promoting the whatever token
 

1285
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,350
good way of promoting the whatever token
is promoting network project etc can you

1286
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,360
is promoting network project etc can you
 

1287
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,510
is promoting network project etc can you
also maybe give some examples of good

1288
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:41,520
also maybe give some examples of good
 

1289
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,590
also maybe give some examples of good
dividend distribution and

1290
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:43,600
dividend distribution and
 

1291
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,909
dividend distribution and
not so good

1292
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:45,919
not so good
 

1293
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,230
not so good
i mean i think currently there's no i

1294
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,240
i mean i think currently there's no i
 

1295
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,630
i mean i think currently there's no i
mean there are some good examples of dao

1296
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:50,640
mean there are some good examples of dao
 

1297
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,549
mean there are some good examples of dao
but i did the best i i think they are

1298
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:52,559
but i did the best i i think they are
 

1299
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,190
but i did the best i i think they are
much more way too improved i mean using

1300
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,200
much more way too improved i mean using
 

1301
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,710
much more way too improved i mean using
example right maker dao has been doing

1302
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:56,720
example right maker dao has been doing
 

1303
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,950
example right maker dao has been doing
this for a long time right for uh die

1304
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:58,960
this for a long time right for uh die
 

1305
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,350
this for a long time right for uh die
stable coin for do to do so but are they

1306
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,360
stable coin for do to do so but are they
 

1307
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,029
stable coin for do to do so but are they
the best they are not right they still

1308
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:03,039
the best they are not right they still
 

1309
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,390
the best they are not right they still
have hacks they still have like you know

1310
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,400
have hacks they still have like you know
 

1311
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,230
have hacks they still have like you know
issues with their governance and they're

1312
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:06,240
issues with their governance and they're
 

1313
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,470
issues with their governance and they're
still trying to improve um i mean

1314
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
still trying to improve um i mean
 

1315
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,390
still trying to improve um i mean
there's no black and white in this but

1316
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:10,400
there's no black and white in this but
 

1317
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,590
there's no black and white in this but
of course there are some bad doubts

1318
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:11,600
of course there are some bad doubts
 

1319
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,510
of course there are some bad doubts
right that hey i just would use the word

1320
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:13,520
right that hey i just would use the word
 

1321
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,870
right that hey i just would use the word
the dao and raise money and then they

1322
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,880
the dao and raise money and then they
 

1323
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,029
the dao and raise money and then they
run away so i mean those are the bad

1324
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:17,039
run away so i mean those are the bad
 

1325
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,390
run away so i mean those are the bad
examples the good one is the one that

1326
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,400
examples the good one is the one that
 

1327
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,310
examples the good one is the one that
runs really transparently and has been

1328
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,320
runs really transparently and has been
 

1329
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,590
runs really transparently and has been
here for a while

1330
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
here for a while
 

1331
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,269
here for a while
i'm using the maker as an example right

1332
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:23,279
i'm using the maker as an example right
 

1333
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,110
i'm using the maker as an example right
although i'm not afraid with them but

1334
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,120
although i'm not afraid with them but
 

1335
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,430
although i'm not afraid with them but
you know the enemies has been well that

1336
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:27,440
you know the enemies has been well that
 

1337
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,190
you know the enemies has been well that
their name of the company and the dao

1338
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
their name of the company and the dao
 

1339
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,029
their name of the company and the dao
has been in the industry for a while

1340
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:31,039
has been in the industry for a while
 

1341
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,630
has been in the industry for a while
that you know that at least you can

1342
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
that you know that at least you can
 

1343
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,390
that you know that at least you can
trust their brand name right or their

1344
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:34,400
trust their brand name right or their
 

1345
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,430
trust their brand name right or their
association with that so i mean i think

1346
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,440
association with that so i mean i think
 

1347
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,430
association with that so i mean i think
you continue to improve um those are two

1348
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,440
you continue to improve um those are two
 

1349
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,310
you continue to improve um those are two
examples i can think of

1350
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,320
examples i can think of
 

1351
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,909
examples i can think of
actually i'd like to

1352
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:43,919
actually i'd like to
 

1353
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,830

so i'd like to propose that actually the
dao can be used for more than just

1358
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,320
dao can be used for more than just
 

1359
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,029
dao can be used for more than just
commercial money making purposes right

1360
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:53,039
commercial money making purposes right
 

1361
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,149
commercial money making purposes right
because as a tool it's a neutral uh it

1362
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:56,159
because as a tool it's a neutral uh it
 

1363
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,909
because as a tool it's a neutral uh it
is neutral and can be used you can use

it for good you can use it for
 

1367
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,390
it for good you can use it for
not so good stuff

1368
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:02,400
not so good stuff
 

1369
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,630
not so good stuff
that's everything about using it for for

1370
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:04,640
that's everything about using it for for
 

1371
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,710

right it's a way where you can
 

1375
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,909
right it's a way where you can
incentivize and motivate

1376
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:11,919
incentivize and motivate
 

1377
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,350

so the the dial itself can be directed

1422
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:01,440
so the the dial itself can be directed
 

1423
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,990
so the the dial itself can be directed
towards uh different course depending on

for blockchain fund as well it takes a

1438
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:18,559
for blockchain fund as well it takes a
 

1439
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,390
for blockchain fund as well it takes a
long time to make a decision because you

1440
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:20,400
long time to make a decision because you
 

1441
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,990
long time to make a decision because you
have to go through all the paperwork and

1442
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,000
have to go through all the paperwork and
 

1443
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,789
have to go through all the paperwork and
all the discussions duty et cetera

uh but if the quantum if the company is

1446
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:26,720
uh but if the quantum if the company is
 

1447
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,230
uh but if the quantum if the company is
big then it makes sense if you are

1448
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,240
big then it makes sense if you are
 

1449
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,669
big then it makes sense if you are
investing in hundreds of millions

1450
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:29,679
investing in hundreds of millions
 

1451
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,750
investing in hundreds of millions
billions or not tens of millions it

1452
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:31,760
billions or not tens of millions it
 

1453
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,430
billions or not tens of millions it
makes sense to go through a due process

1454
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:33,440
makes sense to go through a due process
 

1455
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,190
makes sense to go through a due process
but if it's a small amount

1456
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:35,200
but if it's a small amount
 

1457
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,190
but if it's a small amount
then it's a waste of time right so you

1458
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,200
then it's a waste of time right so you
 

1459
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,789
then it's a waste of time right so you
may want to decentralize that and say

1460
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:38,799
may want to decentralize that and say
 

1461
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,789
may want to decentralize that and say
okay let the whoever that's interested

done quick quickly so that uh depending
 

1471
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,870
done quick quickly so that uh depending
on value we can decentralize it so so i

1472
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
on value we can decentralize it so so i
 

1473
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,029
on value we can decentralize it so so i
think this is a true application at c

uh
 

1917
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,629
uh
i would say that

1918
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:42,639
i would say that
 

1919
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,869
i would say that
i'll give you example uh not many people

1920
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:44,879
i'll give you example uh not many people
 

1921

people but to cross chain execute the

1926
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:52,320
people but to cross chain execute the
 

1927
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,030
people but to cross chain execute the
vote into different chains and this is a

1928
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,040
vote into different chains and this is a
 

1929
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,349
vote into different chains and this is a
really interesting topic for me as well

1930
00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:57,359
really interesting topic for me as well
 

1931

and
 

1933
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,270
and
do think that dao is a much bigger

1934
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:01,280
do think that dao is a much bigger
 

1935
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,470
do think that dao is a much bigger
concept than just you know voting and

2008
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,000
inspired by this solution right now we
 

2009
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,349
inspired by this solution right now we
create a multi-chain platform and we are

2010
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:27,359
create a multi-chain platform and we are
 

2011
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,710
create a multi-chain platform and we are
looking for opportunities to

2012
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:30,720

 

2013
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,950

to scale our solution from multichain to

2014
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:32,960
to scale our solution from multichain to
 

2015
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,430
to scale our solution from multichain to
cross chain to allow the house to create

2016
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:35,440

a single dow to manage all the funds of

2018
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:37,760
a single dow to manage all the funds of
 

2019
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,750
a single dow to manage all the funds of
course it's convenient because you don't

2020
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:39,760
course it's convenient because you don't
 

2021
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,109
course it's convenient because you don't
have to

2022
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:41,119
have to
 

2023
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,190
have to
duplicate your voting power tokens on

2024
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,200
duplicate your voting power tokens on
 

2025
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,550
duplicate your voting power tokens on
every blockchain you will have a single

2026
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:46,560
every blockchain you will have a single
 

2027
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,870

2028
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:48,880
centralized accounting in the central
 

2029
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,109
centralized accounting in the central
space and that's it i think this is the

2030
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:51,119
space and that's it i think this is the
 

2031
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,030
space and that's it i think this is the
future and of course we need more

2032
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,040
future and of course we need more
 

2033
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,550
future and of course we need more

bridges because
 

2035
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,870
bridges because
nowadays bridges are not so cool to

2036
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:56,880
nowadays bridges are not so cool to
 

2037

it's dow a killer app
maybe not yet maybe the potential is

2082
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:46,640
maybe not yet maybe the potential is
 

2083
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,750
maybe not yet maybe the potential is
there but maybe not yet and bridging i

2084
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:49,760
there but maybe not yet and bridging i
 

2085
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,670
there but maybe not yet and bridging i
see bridging not as a

2086
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:51,680
see bridging not as a

00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:54,640
standalone uh problem that the dial can
 

2089
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,470
standalone uh problem that the dial can
solve but it's more like a feature or an

2090
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:56,480
solve but it's more like a feature or an
 

2091
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,109
solve but it's more like a feature or an
attribute that it has to have in order

2092
00:37:59,109 --> 00:37:59,119
attribute that it has to have in order
 

2093
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,349

to facilitate transfer of
asset value between chains but it should

2096
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:04,560
asset value between chains but it should
 

2097
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,550
asset value between chains but it should
be built in ideal way should be built in

2098
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:06,560
be built in ideal way should be built in
 

2099
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,150
be built in ideal way should be built in
a way where it's a neutral it's not just

2100
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:08,160
a way where it's a neutral it's not just
 

2101
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,550
a way where it's a neutral it's not just
one way direction only for other chain

2102
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:10,560
one way direction only for other chain
 

2103
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,710
one way direction only for other chain
to transfer value inwards into one chain

2104
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:12,720
to transfer value inwards into one chain
 

2105
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,670
to transfer value inwards into one chain
and not

2106
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:13,680
and not
 

2107
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,349
and not
the other way around

2108
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:15,359
the other way around

so if it can be built in a neutral way i

2110
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,280
so if it can be built in a neutral way i
 

2111
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,630
so if it can be built in a neutral way i
think that will be very good for the

so if if uh if we can let's say in the

2116
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:22,800
so if if uh if we can let's say in the
 

2117
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,550
so if if uh if we can let's say in the
case of everscale right if we have a

2118
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:24,560
case of everscale right if we have a
 

2119
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,790
case of everscale right if we have a
dial that have all the widgets that we

2120
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:26,800
dial that have all the widgets that we
 

2121
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,910
dial that have all the widgets that we
can allow cross chain transfer of value

2122
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:29,920
