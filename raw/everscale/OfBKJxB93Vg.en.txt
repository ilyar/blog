the sm ft protocol and security
the soft majority fault tolerance
protocol is the core of the everscale
network it's a variant of the
proof-of-stake consensus model with
major tweaks everscale has both sharding
and multi-threading meaning all
validator nodes are divided into groups
the smaller the groups are the bigger
the risk of validators colluding and
sending false blocks but not with the
smft protocol
the smft protocol requires every block
sent to the network to be verified
first a thread collater i.e the
validator proposing a new block
sends it to all nodes of the work chain
then some nodes of the work chain called
broadcast protectors
ensure that the block has been sent to
51 of validators and send this
information to the master chain the
validators then randomly choose a number
of verifiers which have to verify that
the block is correct and then also
submit the proof up to the master chain
the chance of slipping through this kind
of multi-level check is minimal all
validators trying to ship a false block
or those who don't report this behavior
will be heavily punished by having their
stake slashed
the probability of an attack being
successfully performed requires the
majority of nodes to be malicious
because it's impossible to calculate
which node is going to become a verifier
the best strategy for all validators who
want to keep their stake intact is
therefore to be honest the smft protocol
thus makes everscale comparable only to
bitcoin
in terms of security
