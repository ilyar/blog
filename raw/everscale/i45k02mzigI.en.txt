don't quote me though
guys
hey alex from sigma
hi having fun
hey
no
no spend this time unfortunately
but it's kind of fun
maybe later tonight
have fun
no on a serious note it's about two
times bigger than last year i see my
dubai
so um
maybe
i know
roughly two times bigger so it's
interesting i probably should have
sponsored them
that's good that's excellent
cool
all right look um
we've got uh let me make sure we have
everybody that we need
got darkwing we have john
yeah i think we're good okay all right
let's uh let's start
um yes
clear my throat
uh hi everybody welcome to everscale
community call number 96 thank you for
joining us and we have yet another uh
stellar lineup today so we're gonna hear
about uh nft
standardization i think uh everybody saw
that in the uh the uh announcement
um we have quite
a few uh
africa ever scale projects and use cases
that are going to come up which i'm very
very excited about and we're going to
hear an update from everscale academy as
well uh so yeah uh it's going to be good
before we get started i'm going to do my
usual repetitive
blah blah blah but you know for anybody
that's joining us maybe for the first
time maybe on youtube and doesn't know
uh want to make sure everybody's clear
so unless you're um
unless you're churning butter or milking
a bull uh and this is by
a reference uh to a movie called kingpin
if you haven't seen it you should see it
it's really really funny anyway um
please turn your cameras on we'd love to
see you
uh please save any questions you have
until each presenter is finished
uh please use the razer hand feature in
zoom to do so if you're on youtube
please leave your questions in the
comments section we'll get to them at
the end
and of course yeah we always do this in
english so um just before we get started
though i do have a small little uh
comment i want to make
there was some uh discrepancy uh about
the dune swap
uh so
i posted a comment in the main chat
saying that basically it's on hold which
technically that was
was past tense correct
uh but immediately after it was
rectified uh a road map was created so
everybody
from the dune community
panic not
uh everything is going to be just fine
the swap is going to happen
and the road map itself i believe is
going to be published and announced
very soon i mean i've already seen a
draft so so not to worry we're moving
forward the problem is solved at least
as far as i understand so yeah my little
um my little two cents okay uh let's
begin uh the way we always do with
technical updates from mita peter if
you're ready
yeah i am ready do you hear me well
i do because i'm in the middle of uh
anyway um i'm in belgrade now actually
meeting some team members here for uh
that so we have been relocating to
um to more quieter to quieter places so
anyway as you all know
we had rolled well no not all but the
validators now we have rolled out the
update
which did two things
first of all it fixed the the shard
that has stopped
uh on sunday
and um
but uh apart from that we also like it
was actually a big update that we
prepared for a long time that i spoke
about
and
this update contains a huge amount of
actually stuff like the
penny cast
fixes and uh
several instructions to tv and new tbm
instructions like my code and uh init
code hash instructions and
zero trif instruction and um
zero three oops sorry
did i did you lose me no
no no no we can hear that okay yeah so z
zero zero three f and zero three two and
zero three four naught and zero three if
not two and zero
swap if and zero swap if two and zero
swap if not and zero swap if not two
um
so yeah
then
um we will release a
special documentation about all of these
instructions and
then
we also changed an account format
and
there has been a compression um that
everybody was asked about uh introduced
in this release
and the
set lip code and changelip code was
disabled which uh
library stuff and
some fixes for validator are not
validating and some fixes security fixes
on the adl
uh and so on so
these um has been delivered the shards
have been fixed because that was also
part of the security updates anyway so
it fixed this as well for unica for any
cost
and uh like by the way
um now
all of this
so some of these are activated already
like zero
uh instructions that i have uh mentioned
and uh some insecurity fixes and uh
disabled of lib codes and stuff that was
have been activated and some of them has
not been activated yet
like uh like my code and they need code
hash instruction and the account format
change and traffic compression has not
been activated yet we will wait until we
we need to wait until the network is
passed to release like block version 20.
so block version 21 block version 22
that's what we want to see
um like more than 90
something percent activated once it's
done we will activate these features
because these features are incompatible
with everything including of course cpus
plus node but also
including
up to version 20
of the current snows there are some
percentage of validators still running
version 15 and 16s and whatnot
so i don't know how to make it very
clear that they actually you cannot do
that guys like you need to update
the network
so um
yeah so
bottom line waiting for
network to upgrade to propagate
and
then we will activate all these
excellent features extensions and some
and more stuff so yeah
that's all from me i think
thanks a lot
thank you mita uh we have a question or
a comment from
uh ben
hey guys uh yeah just a quick one nature
um a couple of people have uh noted in
the telegram chats recently that the
number of validators has seen a little
bit of a drop off uh is this due to in
layman's terms i'm kind of asking for um
is this due to like you say people not
updating would you say
no
no and
it has nothing to do with me
um
this is a governance
change that has been done
to exclude some malicious validators
again
i have nothing to do with that
i didn't vote for this
so you need to ask
the global governance for
explanations about this stuff not me
okay and it's not related to technical
stuff at all
i also know that a couple of uh the
nodes went down uh in the uh uh from the
uh uh france folks the dune folks
but we're working on actually fixing
that now
so
yeah
excellent excellent thank you
okay um next uh we have uh john canery
uh from everscale africa and uh
and darkweed and lexi from
uh everscale academy uh
and i think i mentioned earlier there's
a bunch of projects that they're doing
uh there's uh
something called the logic link exchange
which i guess is still beta but uh it's
going to
bring on uh things like m-pesa to
onboard new users table banking
uh they have their own native token
called the uh is it the shuja shuja
um i
understand it's an arabic word for hero
yeah arabic word for it means brave or
hero or something like that and they
have their own nft marketplace starting
called imara so um uh john and i chatted
a little bit i think john is gonna start
first and darkwing you're gonna follow
up right that's that's how we're going
to do this so yeah yeah
thank you ron
uh thank you for giving me this
opportunity
uh the basket community
to present to you our projects for
africa
in this presentation i will demonstrate
our intentions that are in progress some
complete and others in developmental
stage
the main motivation
being to engage
in specific endeavors
based on research on requirements of the
african community
the activities
and
we wish to also upgrade those activities
and offer a trustless platform
to be used by the intended audiences
it is our hope also that uh whatever we
are working on
will be of our great or immense benefit
to
[Music]
the eva scale global community
so i will
briefly share my screen
and be able to
present to you guys and show you what
you are doing
please
yes
uh
it's still blank i think
maybe some problem with connection john
yeah
are you able to see my screen
we see that yours you were wanting to
share but it's still just
uh black with it
just has uh it says has started sharing
the screen but we don't actually see it
if you wanna you can maybe try to send
me
your part of presentation maybe i can
try to share
just an option
yeah
maybe it will work
okay
i'll just try to log in with another
machine uh
just
[Music]
um
do we want to maybe uh just shuffle uh
the presentations maybe we start with uh
what the next presentation would be in
the top never mind there we go i think
we're seeing something
that says not respond uh we can uh
can maybe
okay
yeah um
maybe alex you can go first uh okay
uh
okay uh i can start with the second
presentation and then you
uh
will share no problem okay
okay
just just a second i will share the
screen uh please can can you please uh
turn off your sharing and i will share
uh can you please oh yes thank you
okay
um
just a second just
okay
uh
okay
uh yes let's start with uh presenting at
the african ft marketplace in mara
so uh it's a
marketplace which actually just a second
[Music]
some technical
problems today
um
okay do you see my screen yes
yes
yes great
uh
so it's a nft marketplace which is
created for african artists and painters
and everybody who want to create
something great for africa and place it
as nft
i will briefly show
some pages from
this marketplace its
main page
its
explore page by the way part of this
page i think all this page uh are now in
development and by the way
uh
we have already published it uh on uh
domain uh email.space uh but after we
will
test it after we will test all mechanics
we will officially publish it uh in
every scale groups and invite everybody
to test it finally
uh
so
yep just some pages uh to show you user
profile
design uh the design was prepared
special uh was prepared to
show
some specifics of everyone art and so on
so what is domain uh it's uh that will
use a native suggested token
on
marketplace on any marketplace too and
by the way one of the
idea which we
which we are currently discussed that uh
you know that is the problem that is the
usual problem when for example you need
to decide uh somebody
place some bad picture in on your
marketplace and you need to decide
delete it or not
to solve this problem
we discuss it and propose to create uh
something like dao
actually dao
uh
with this uh token
and
um token holders
will decide what to do for example like
in process and i'll we will create
proposal for example delete this item
because of these this and this
and uh with dao we will decide to delete
it
or not
uh current roadmap that end of march we
will uh
fully uh finish the developing uh
developing stage
uh enable in april for usability test
and beta test
may officially for production release
and also in the on the may we will start
promotion
and user attraction it means marketing
and all our stuff to attract more and
more users create something on this
smart place
uh and just some little sentence to add
from the from me uh
that
we are looking and waiting for
uh
nft officially uh
nft standard from everscale community to
use it uh on this uh marketplace
too so i can say
welcome to amara african nft marketplace
and
soon we'll we will
publish
this marketplace for testing for
feedback and other stuff
and i think it will be
really great project especially we can
attract
more
uh
more people from african countries and i
think there are a lot of artists there
thank you
that's fantastic very good very very
good so you're actually going to have a
consensus uh based on uh people who hold
your tokens to decide whether or not a
uh
an nft is is worth going
up for sale or not
yeah i think that dao is the best way to
solve this problem when we need to
decide is it proper or is it proper or
not and i think that should you talk and
that our suggested token can endow can
solve this problem and it will be more
more technical and more interesting
okay um john uh are you ready
yeah yeah i'm ready sorry about that
that's okay that happens
uh just a second i will
stop my sharing
[Music]
interesting
oh i know
okay
okay thank you
thank you john
yes
yeah
okay there we are we can see it
yes so
uh once again i apologize for
the technical mishap it's okay
technology is never perfect
yeah
so um
ever scale african projects are as
follows we have three
categories as at the moment
one is a local exchange
that is uh m-pesa power
second is a table banking it's a digital
type of banking platform
that is meant to on board the unbound
and the branch of course
then we have the nft marketplace which
was to come the third presentation but
had to be
done before this one
so those are the three projects that we
are we undertaking
as uh evascal africa
so the
details and features of the local
exchange are uh m-pesa integration
uh which is a new feature and it's rare
i think i've only seen it on binance but
not to the extent that you are doing it
because in binance they are doing
registration of merchants who are and
better traders
so as the exchange itself is uh
is an m-versa registered
uh trading platform
from the service providers called
safaricom we have a bulk steel number
and
when we make our videos we'll explain
this uh further
through youtube
the exchange also will have uh the
normal asset conversion and trading
an escrow service to link the users and
the merchants
and custodial wallets
we also have
some
population in africa without smartphones
so we have the ssd message code that is
given by the
sim card and the
phone and then there's a transaction
providers
the application that we have
developed is
i can i've gotten some screenshots from
it so that it will be easier and faster
for me to
uh
present today
so this is how the login page looks like
it's not fully developed graphic-wise
but uh from the technicians and the
developers they they've been able to
produce this
for demonstration purposes
uh we have the
normal login
uh
and
we shall begin the testing phase later
next week
and hopefully launch
visa product by april
our dashboard
looks like that
it has
these particular tokens that are here
to start with
we have the on the left side we have the
dashboard which shows you your wallet
balances your deposits total withdrawals
and normally what an exchange does
the second item will be the table
banking
which
will be a major part of this i'll
explain it in another slide
later on but generally this is how
the assets are displayed
the prices are in real time and updated
uh on the second on this uh screen we
have
the invesa
integration part
now we can deposit
crypto assets normally how we do from
external or from within
but now we can be able to buy
crypto assets you can buy e-box you can
buy
usdt you can buy bitcoin directly from
your phone
so for the mps are registered users
they can be able to
uh just put a figure
and send from the system which will send
a message to their phone
and they will be able to deposit money
to the
bulk steel number for logic click
exchange
and the tokens will be automatically
credited into their wallet
uh withdrawal will still be the opposite
of
deposit you can be able to sell your
assets
and receive money
through the investor and this initially
it's uh the phone and sim card
together so you'll be able to get
your
uh your funds your fiat currency
on the phone
once you you create a
withdrawal
another feature that we have for the
exchange is something called merchants
it's a merchant uh platform
so you can register the much and
sell your assets
at a premium
a premium price
will be registering you on this platform
so that
you can be able to sell
uh your assets
to willing buyers who come to this
platform and mainly
uh through an escrow service
that addresses the
transability between
the seller and the buyer
we also have sorry we also have now we
have the buyers
registration merchants and we have the
sellers so the people who are buying can
register as buyers in their system
advice assets at a discounted price of
cost and they can be able to set
themselves up
and sell at the same time
uh we also have the normal assets
conversion
from one currency to another
the platform is able to do that
we can be able to transfer
the assets
directly from an external wallet to our
wallet from
our wallet to an external vice versa
now a little bit of a table banking
which is uh the second product
in production
uh
i'll explain a little bit of what it is
and how it works
now uh table banking is investment in
groups where a group of people bring
their funds together and
save to do some some some kind of
project
they can decide to bring money monthly
and give it to one person
these are practices that are very common
in africa
so we decided to create a
platform a trustless
platform
which members can actually transact
without actually meeting and
we are laying down the group membership
platform
how an administrator can create those
his members
how he can
be able to create rules for that group
uh how uh
a group a specific uh investment group
can get funding
and how we can
deal with the escrow service
holding securities for investors who are
investing in this group
we also have a section whereby we will
be collecting
data from our regular users
and give them a credit score
which
other financial
investments
groups would like to know
about creditworthiness of some
individuals will be able to go for that
we also look at
the point of
investments from these groups because
they will be saving a lot of funds
uh how they can be earning through
staking and other auxiliary products
that will be unleashing and uh table
banking
on the final part on my presentation uh
all these platforms uh will be
inaugurating a
native token to
be used within the ecosystem
so shija will be on board and this will
be a utility
ecosystem currency
of course we'll have uh evas in it we
tend to create a
pool for it and uh
currently we are in discussion on the
economics
and we hope that it will be an
additional investment avenue
for inverse scalar network users
uh
i was to introduce image but of course
mother has been presented so
my
presentation comes to an end uh thank
you and i apologize for the technical
digits
no worries at all john no worries at all
it happens all the time believe me
if everything isn't
just
i it was fantastic uh let's see um
does anybody have questions i don't see
any hands raised uh
i don't see anything on youtube but i
think people will likely
write wrong
can i ask one
you can of course of course
john first of all thank you very much
it's amazing alex of course uh what kind
of help do you guys need from the
community from
are you 4k
or foreign
well um i know maybe you would refer to
the funding part
um
at the moment we're able to get
local investors
at the expense of getting uh
the projects being centralized so that's
something that i'm trying to avoid
uh people funding and
owning their projects
it's something i have to god but uh we
have agreed with the sub governance that
uh despite
people funding us
to run the campaigns
uh we will once once we launch we'll be
able to go to d5 alliance and try to see
whether we can get funding
for the marketing part and roll out of
the project itself
[Music]
yes i'm done
make sense you can take a look at the
grounds
that the defy lines is doing as well
uh so that's one of the
yes
alex is going out a little bit so yeah
yeah yeah absolutely i think uh an
application to the grants program here
would be absolutely fantastic and uh i
would
personally
say good
i will do it we'll do it we'll be there
yeah yeah
that that's your that's your access to
funding
yes
john thank you so very much thank you
excellent presentation very interesting
stuff
very very
just just fantastic things all right
okay um let's move to our next presenter
and speaking of nfts uh everscale uh has
been working on nft
uh
something will be out very very soon we
brought marina back with us from it gold
and i guess uh marina you have a little
bit to share right
that's right hi everyone nice to meet
you again well perhaps uh you know that
the community did not accept the nfc
alliance proposal but
life
goes on we continue to work on our
primary goals and as ron already said
for almost two months
nft alliance uh was working on
implementation of the nft standard in
everscale
why is it uh because everscale is as an
asynchronous blockchain
uh never
adopted any standards for the nft and
uh the ones we have in other networks
are not effective in this case
so the task was to discuss the existing
established practices and develop a
solution that considers features on our
network
representative
uh representatives of itigold grand
bazaar scale punks broxas tonium and
other active community members attended
the discussion in the working chat in
telegram and a document containing the
nft standard and three substandards
became the result of this
friendly cooperation
around may i ask you please to post two
links
to alliance github and general
documentation from
our
chat and zoom here for our youtube
audience
i'd be glad to right
well guys let me briefly
go through the main points
of the standard
um
the tip 4.1
non-fungible token in general
the standard which describes working
with nft creating managing and
eliminating it
the implementation of this standard is
the minimum sufficient condition for
creating
your own
new and ethical actions
the
substandard tip 4.2
which describes
the
storage of json metadata in nft
everscale did not standardized
the storage of the content component
before
and each team made its own decisions and
schemes and we've considered the minimum
necessary data set that will allow to
refuse reuse nft and display it
similarly in different browsers
uh that's what
uh tip 4.2 standard is about
um tip 4.3 about on-chain indexes it
describes indexing of nft by indexes in
the blockchain for a quick search
of nft in collections and among owners
following this standard simplifies the
search of new collections and nft for
existing and new explorers of the
network
and at last tip 4.4
on chain storage this substandard
describes data storage inside work
chains
following this standard will allow
storing data inside the blockchain
making it resistant to value of services
and at the moment the technical
limitation of the network
allows storing not more than four
megabytes but i hope this will be
um
larger soon
well
um
the next
goals the process on the standardization
are to further development of the
standard and transferring
all nft alliance members products to
this standard there will be also a
possibility for users to upgrade
previous nfts to the new standard
and of course grand bazaar io
will be among the first to support the
standard
then we are going to create
uh some tools for convenient landing of
new developers in nft and game five
sectors
and of course to support these users
and
have to say that we also plan to
standardize connecting wallets to
off-chain solutions
that is why the next go for the alliance
development team will be
what we call ever connect
a technology that will allow all the
products and websites markets on the
network to support a single standard of
operation regardless on which wallet the
user uses
it will be challenging and uplift
because it is necessary that all wallets
support the technology but first
negotiations have already begun so i
believe it will be fine although it will
take some time and
that's all from me for today guys thank
you for listening
maybe any questions
thank you marina thank you very much um
yeah um and you know i have to admit um
sort of know what's going on over there
so uh
yeah we have a couple of folks that are
friends of ours that are that are also
helping so yeah fantastic um i'd
actually i actually expected a lot of
questions to come up and
surprisingly i'm not seeing anybody oh
okay um we do have one from youtube and
since we don't have too many from
youtube i can ask it now
um
uh a gentleman asks can you please show
the code
or interface
of
nft
and then he says oh i didn't notice
thanks okay
we definitely can show the code in
github so please welcome i uh i believe
that um yeah i i put it in there
so yeah
answer this question
uh enter the chat
um
if you need it really we have several
groups and telegram where you can find
some information on the standard and get
some news and maybe ask
admins privately about
any information you need we will try to
guide you
welcome
thank you very much marina thank you
bravo
very good
okay
uh
all right let's uh let's move on uh
we're gonna go back to darkwing uh who
started us off uh
about the goings-on at the everscale
academy and i have to apologize to him
personally because uh he's been trying
to get a slot for everscale academy on
the call for several weeks and and by
the way this is
a really small thing for everybody else
if you have anything that you'd like to
present on the weekly call you can just
dm me uh at ronmelo and telegram that's
at r-o-n-m-i
if you want to present something we'd
love to have you we'd love to schedule
you ahead but right now we're like
backed up like a couple weeks ahead of
time i mean i can tell you that by
tomorrow we'll probably have everything
locked up for next week so um so please
yeah we if you have something you want
to say don't just sit in the background
come and you know come and tell your
story say what you want to say bring
your project bring use case bring
whatever um this way everybody knows and
uh and so forth so anyway um
darkwing
everscale academy
yep just one second
i will share my screen
again okay do you see the presentation
yes you see the presentation
yes
uh so yes i will start uh this
presentation with um
use case and especially use case how we
plan to organize the work with courses
[Music]
so
we plan and actually have now three user
types it's a student teacher and then
[Music]
and each
has their own user flow
and how it's so how it's happened uh
happens so teacher plays a course for
evers we take about uh 15
for placing the course by the way we
will discuss it this percent with uh
other academy members one more time
tomorrow
and uh we take uh two hours uh for
every of for
every enroll for every enroll to meet uh
nft certificate for their
students
uh because we decide in in the academy
we decide to make a little partnership
with grand bazaar and now uh with them
we will try to make a nappy uh and by
the way it will be it will be useful for
both of us because they can use this
this fee for other partners and we can
use it to
demonstrate
you mean api right api yeah api api and
we can use to demonstrate the
certificates on our website because now
it's i free
uh by the way
uh some days ago we start to meet
certificates and transfer uh them to the
students
and i think it's good case because
from this little step finally we can
test the
concept that only entity address
can be approved
for
for somebody that
uh students really take uh this uh
course
so uh from sorry uh so uh for the
student it will be easier find the
course buy it forevers complete the
course and get nft uh certificate
and about the admin uh
path
uh
i like i like the idea of dao
and by it uh by and i think that in the
academy we will discuss it it's
currently on discussion on the on
discussion but uh also creating some
doubt and one of the point why i like to
create the dao it's to
decide um
just to decide is sample core is some
course good or not
okay
uh here i described the
the total use case
create course we check it
all the steps
uh
energy certificates available only in
paid courses it means the teacher must
create
just a course for one ever to
share
certificates
uh also uh
about academy that
academy and especially our advisors like
kenny murros of uh try to use every
opportunity with help for proxies and
debriefs and uh
as you can see here
we especially evgeny participate in
number of
conference
for gba in u.s
and conference which organized by gba
by the way some presentation of this
conference you can find on the website
in the
presentation page
so
i will try to make it
more shortly so uh academic token yes uh
we create academy token which is called
academy and yes the economics uh now uh
discussion but uh we plan to use it uh
to use this coin for dao for payments
and for locating budget and academy
maybe two
[Music]
there are some ideas that guinea
proposed that terror scale foundation
creates the academy endowment as follows
you can see some points of this
endowment
and finally
[Music]
the now ecosystem
includes and will include such resources
like error scale academy ever scale
codes it will be
redeveloped
and updated after full testing overscale
academy and the board monsters also need
more time because a lot of the updates
in
academia
and by the way we have started some very
useful courses with african community
and i think we will continue to do that
so now the road map is that ah end of
march we will test paid courses and nft
certificates by the way i invite
everybody to for
additional call i guess on monday i will
do
official announcement in the groups and
i really want to invite everybody to
test
in real time to test to ask and
and so on because
one day and
all work i think
is done that's why i will make
announcement for monday to test it
finally and so on
also april will be for engaged community
in making courses by the way i started
to make courses with my own
i start with some
very
uh
very easy
courses like how to
start first simple web app in every
scale
uh but really want to make more courses
which are more related to development
and i and
i hope all developer all developers will
help us in this too and i will try to
create courses and other our members
uh also from
uh from april uh
we i personally wanna change our main
engine because
previously we use already
developed
lms system and from april after testing
current engine i will start i will start
to
remake it
for getting more
good parameters of scalability in react
or
angular
uh
so
yeah uh separate roadmap for every score
every scale codes to moderate and
harmonize the existing documentation and
every scale course
and about the boatman starts monsters a
little bit later
will be announced uh additional roadmap
uh so
uh
i learned with this uh because really
too many directions in academy which we
wanted to implement skates make courses
and so on that's why a lot of work to do
but finally i think it will be
good for our scale
community need more need a lot of time
but
bring a lot of value uh i will get i i
will so now
you've given me more
if you want to add something
it's yeah i see i see he's here and he's
got his hand raised so uh eugene
yes uh thanks ron can you hear me
absolutely yeah first of all yeah alex
thank you for good work uh uh uh alex as
you all guys know has been an active
contributor to the academy continues to
be one
so thank you very much i also wanted to
extend the word of thanks to a number of
our initial members
including andre fidos of gerard dashea
and many others
who voiced support
for the academy and essentially
suggested also broxas obviously and
suggested some ways we should improve
which we listen to very carefully one of
the suggestions that we received is to
commercialize
academy activities so what alex was
describing today is just an example
uh where we would be collecting fees uh
for providing services to teachers
students
and uh that would be one source of
revenue the other one would be uh
developing courses needed by the
community like which ones are the
priority we expect to be told
uh for example by defy alliance that
there is a demand for such and such
course and then we implement it with a
corresponding
budget or funding whatever
available specifically to achieve that
goal by the community
uh another example of monetization
strategies that we are pursuing right
now is to
place uh it's already in the works
actively um to place uh government will
train association certification
uh courses online and uh also provide uh
successful students with nft
certificates
uh gba has approved this provided
already material and so we just need to
implement that would be a third way to
monetize and of course another one that
alex mentioned
uh economics and corresponding uh
potential revenue for the academy for
the endowment which we would love to
create um
all of that uh will be reflected in the
updated proposal which i expect to be
published this week and i'm respectful
asking everyone to support it thank you
ron
thank you thank you eugene so i raised
my hand
can you just talk a little bit more
about how you see the endowment working
i i want to i want to understand so um
traditionally for for those people who
don't understand what an endowment is
it's basically a fund that doesn't get
touched right there's a certain amount
of of tokens in this case usually money
that gets put into uh a
fund
it never leaves it just collects a
certain amount of interest right uh
staking if you will uh percentages and
that's the the cream that rises on top
that is what is used to fund different
types of of projects
so
my question is one how much uh of an
endowment are you looking for and um
do you have any more details
yes ron you described it exactly right
what we tried to achieve is a situation
where
no sales
of evers
that were dedicated to um a foundation
are needed
right and they are kept exactly where
they are at the moment
instead
they are used for various approved
investment activities approved by the
management of the foundation right
and those activities like you mentioned
once taking there may be some others uh
that
money is used and any success any
increase in value of that investment
minus whatever minimal costs
uh is indeed spent on a particular goal
in our case uh on ever scale academy
needs
so this is what we would like like to do
this will be reflected in the proposal
exactly wrong literally as you described
and
we believe that this is a good way not
to
create any selling pressure on ever but
instead
create
the funding create the funding with that
original money that is used for
educational purposes that's the idea
right
yeah i can see a lot of applications for
something like that like um
is is the technology that are are you
able to do that now are we are we
capable of doing that i i have i've i i
think it's i as you know you and i
talked about this i always was a was a
fan of this my question is do we have
the ability to do it now
yes if we assume that a multi-sig
for foundation
you know decision makers
is available uh that's really what is
needed um
because in any case all of this
is directly control should be directly
controlled by the foundation right
and they are able to make decisions
collectively or whatever the mechanism
is
as to what type of investment
they would like to see right basics
taking for example maybe the safest one
or whatever else they might come up with
there's a lot of finance guys on board
there i believe they can advise
and so
they control that investment and
whatever is received on a monthly basis
is sent to another wallet
which is dedicated uh to um
let's say fixed expenses so so to say by
the academy one of the things we would
love to do
is to actually bring in a couple of
professionals
uh maybe and those people will need a
salary so if we are able from from the
cream from the cream
of course of course so to answer your
question about the amount i think we
should go
in in the reverse
we should first estimate what the
reasonable expenses for like really
really useful uh team would be
and then simply say okay if we invested
five percent per annum
uh what should be the principal amount
very simple so uh i'm sure a foundation
can certainly do that but the concept
is not that we're asking for a
particular amount
uh the concept is that we are asking for
the principle to be introduced that some
amount is invested and the cream as
you're saying
is used to pay for education and help us
the academy achieve what we really want
to do uh onboarding new users through
education
you're just asking you're just asking
for the soil that goes nowhere but the
trees that grow and
the foliage
in the fruit yeah
which
which emerges is is just
for the picking i i love this idea i am
not enough uh technologically uh astute
to say whether it will work or not but
we know it works in the off chain world
i can absolutely see this working in the
on-chain world at least i hope to see it
working so yeah that's um i support this
idea very very highly support this idea
thank you
thank you that's all from me today
okay um i don't does anybody have
questions i mean
no uh let me check youtube
uh
nope uh so
okay hang on let me pull up my
cheat sheet for our final segment i was
trying to come up with something clever
i didn't really come up with anything
that clever today but
our final segment uh last but most
certainly not least our dearest beloved
curly top huggable hipster
how do you like that but never mind the
 coins podcast man himself ben
coins podcast man himself ben
ben's bits
a couple of minutes before two o'clock
this week excellent excellent yeah
we got it well some excellent
presentations this week so uh really
hang on hang on hang on can we um i
don't see
uh you um
is it just me
oh there we are yep now i see
i i see you you see me excellent
excellent right my bits for the week
let's get these over with uh flat cube
have announced a bounty program for
english uh written educational content
so if if you're good with a pen if you
can write a few words and you want to
earn yourself a little bit of a bounty
um all the details are on the everscale
news channel
everlend is quite an interesting little
startup uh which have recently had their
token sale which is uh very cool it's
the first which is going on on the
particular platform so again do check
that out
uh something i've not looked into myself
too deeply yet i know there are maybe a
few geographical restrictions for some
uh but easy pay can't i assume it's
pronounced easy pay i've only ever seen
it wrote down but i i zi um is a credit
debit card which you can directly use
with ever as i understand it which is i
mean to say that's cool is uh that's
very understanding understatement that's
friggin fantastic exactly
i do like an understatement
right so uh
dot io they've updated the ticker at
last ah that isn't that nice sake and i
mean i i don't do trading talk but i
think there was a little bit of a bump
which kind of you know may have come
from a million things but hopefully that
was an
in the visibility factor at the very
least
as ron kind of mentioned at the start
but if you weren't here for the very
start of the meeting uh june yay
there is progress there is there's much
progress i don't want to
you know say more than i know however i
believe
believe a batch has been moved or is
been moving and
the wheels are turning again at last and
they're they're more than turning
actually the
the proposal put forward by damien and
fabricenko is actually quite interesting
so uh
i don't know ron hopefully they'll be
coming up to uh say a few words on one
of the weeks coming
uh i do miss fabrice's face
and the final bit i've got for you this
week uh about votes on everdao
so i i mean
far be it from me to get all preaching
uh you know that kind of thing but just
just a little bit of kind of common
sense advice guys
a dow indicates kind of community
participation um
if this is gonna work you know i'm sure
we've all heard kind of very silly
stories about downs on other projects
which have almost been lambasted with
preproster preposterous try saying that
word three times preposterous proposals
um you know for for this really to work
properly you know everyone has to take
an interest now i'm a little bit guilty
i'm only just sort of looking over
evidel and all that but you know the the
more people out of us who are on there
you may think you're a small fish but
you know small fish kind of fill the
pond at the end of the day don't we
so
if we don't all get on there and vote
then you know
something you really don't like might
pass on a vote one day and then there's
sweet all you can do about it so
dowels are a beautiful thing they are a
technological innovation
but they do come with their own inherent
kind of factor so yeah that that's my
kind of two cents on the dow situation
i think it's a brilliant initiative but
we you know we do need as many people as
possible keeping eyes on it
and that's my bits thank you very much
and thank you very much um and actually
i have um
um a couple of things right um uh mita
had to to uh and i see there's a
question uh or comment from elena i
apologize is it okay if i skip in line
i'm
i'm violating my own rules but uh
there was a question regarding governow
was whether it uses smv
uh and i don't know if anybody can
answer that and uh from the looks of it
i don't see that anybody here could
uh mita asked that question and i
second that question whether it uses the
smv gossip i'm
i hate the word assume because we all
know it spells an ass out of you and me
but nevertheless i assume
um that it does and if it doesn't we'd
like to hear that um
regarding uh everland everland everland
right would be the proper way to say it
um i'd love to have them on this call
next week
so if you can hook that up that would be
good easy pay as well or i see
eyesight
easy
easy pay so that that's for me um
alina yes please
yes uh yes hi everybody i'm sorry to

um and i had one more uh just comment
that i wanted to make there was a uh
article
that came out on a medium
well that came out on medium but it
obviously got retweeted
which is how to store and manage ever
and chuck this one is for you
uh the
uh mention of deebots
in the surf wallet was
very um passive
and i would like to ask whoever
wrote the article if they can just add a
little bit more about d-bots because for
me personally i think the d-bot aspect
of the eversurf wallet is probably it's
you know uh it's it's it's major uh
uh asset and uh the the the the way that
it was presented was very
in the article my personal feeling you
know you can yell at me if you like but
uh i felt like it just sort of grazed
over one of the most important factors
that the surf wallet has so
please if there's anybody who could
redact edit
uh i would encourage you to do so uh
it's a very important thing so sorry
my own um
let's call it uh
shameless plug
thank you
everybody for coming thank you very much
