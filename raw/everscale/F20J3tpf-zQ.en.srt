don't know but i will not present like

140
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
don't know but i will not present like
 

141
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,510

you see other sites who will present i
think

146
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
think
 

147
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,589
think
the solution i will just say just to

148
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
the solution i will just say just to
 

149
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,550
the solution i will just say just to
remind everyone what what is flex really

150

remind everyone what what is flex really
 

151
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,189
remind everyone what what is flex really
and what's the challenge in there

152
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199
and what's the challenge in there
 

153
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,309
and what's the challenge in there
so the flex is the

154
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319

the
 

167
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,230
the
um like

168
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,240

169
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,190
um like
the only decentralized order book which

170
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
the only decentralized order book which
 

171

also made in distributed computing and
 

173
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,670
also made in distributed computing and
distributed programming which means that

174
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
distributed programming which means that
 

175
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,949
distributed programming which means that
all its contracts are completely atomic

176
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
all its contracts are completely atomic
 

177
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,230
all its contracts are completely atomic
meaning there

178
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
meaning there
 

179
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,550
meaning there
there is no central

180
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
books and there is a reason for that
 

257
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,710

making pool like algorithms and all so

286
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
making pool like algorithms and all so
 

287
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,190
making pool like algorithms and all so
on and you can use different strategies

288
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
on and you can use different strategies
 

289

your pools you can have an investments

292
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
your pools you can have an investments
 

293
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,750
your pools you can have an investments
that that you know come to your pool

294

that that you know come to your pool
 

295
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,910
that that you know come to your pool
from different sources

296

and you can pay different you know
 

299
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,230
and you can pay different you know
whatever fees on top of that so it's

300
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
whatever fees on top of that so it's
 

301
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,230
whatever fees on top of that so it's
really flexible structure where

302
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
really flexible structure where
 

303
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,030

everything is separated like in in in
 

305
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,550
everything is separated like in in in
blockchains like in solutions like

306
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
blockchains like in solutions like
 

307
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,190
blockchains like in solutions like
ethereum you have uni swap which you

308
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
ethereum you have uni swap which you
 

309
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,790

where you cannot do all of these things

310
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:08,800
where you cannot do all of these things
 

311
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,949
where you cannot do all of these things
so you cannot have strategies you cannot

312
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,959
so you cannot have strategies you cannot
 

313
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,350
so you cannot have strategies you cannot
have all the order book like

314
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
have all the order book like
 

315
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,750
have all the order book like
what order books gives you and you also

316
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
what order books gives you and you also
 

317
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,269
what order books gives you and you also
cannot have liquidity pools on top of

318
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
cannot have liquidity pools on top of
 

319
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,110
cannot have liquidity pools on top of
liquidity pool because like this is the

320
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
liquidity pool because like this is the
 

321
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,030
liquidity pool because like this is the
liquidity pool

322
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040
liquidity pool
 

323
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,990

itself

324
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
itself
 

325
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,710
itself
so the flaxes is more traditional in

326
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
so the flaxes is more traditional in
 

327
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,829
so the flaxes is more traditional in
terms of

particular allows you to do such things
now you can use the whole free tone as a

340
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
now you can use the whole free tone as a
 

341
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,550
now you can use the whole free tone as a
database and that's what flex is doing

342
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
database and that's what flex is doing
 

343
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,590

so i think today presentation

344
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:43,600
so i think today presentation
 

345
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,829
so i think today presentation
again and this is one aspect of that

346
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
again and this is one aspect of that
 

347
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,590
again and this is one aspect of that
this is a back end right and well i

348
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600
this is a back end right and well i
 

349
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,350
this is a back end right and well i
already explained that once so just

350
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
already explained that once so just
 

351
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,230
already explained that once so just

just challenging all the dex teams to
 

427
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,509
just challenging all the dex teams to
also participate in the ideal contest

428
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:07,519
also participate in the ideal contest
 

429
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,030
also participate in the ideal contest
because uh actually it is something that

430
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
because uh actually it is something that
 

431
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,829
because uh actually it is something that
uh is complementary to the decks itself

432
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
uh is complementary to the decks itself
 

433
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,670
uh is complementary to the decks itself
and um

and um
 

435
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,629
and um
yeah it's the next logical step at least

436
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
yeah it's the next logical step at least
 

437
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,509
yeah it's the next logical step at least
yeah so anyway so so so for example i'm

438
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
yeah so anyway so so so for example i'm
 

439
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,590
yeah so anyway so so so for example i'm
going to start this the podcast which

as well
 

461
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,430
as well
um well it's at least that's very hard

462
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
um well it's at least that's very hard
 

463
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,710
um well it's at least that's very hard
to do

464
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720
to do
 

465

other aspect of that
 

475
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,829
other aspect of that
is the interface

just to discourage people to
spend real money on these tokens

694
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
spend real money on these tokens
 

695
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,029
spend real money on these tokens
at the moment

696
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,039

 

697
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,669

so for each trade pair we have

698
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:15,679
so for each trade pair we have
 

699
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,909
so for each trade pair we have
three

700
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:17,919
three
 

701
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,350
three
major areas the first area is the charts

702
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
major areas the first area is the charts
 

703
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,390
major areas the first area is the charts
area then we have

704
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,400
area then we have
 

705
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,390

708
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
and finally we have a buy and sell areas
 

709
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,630

943
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,830

okay we realized

944
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:48,840
okay we realized
 

945
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,710
okay we realized
that i have more

946
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:54,720

 

947
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,510

just maybe stop sharing to send well let

948
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,520
just maybe stop sharing to send well let
 

949
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,909
just maybe stop sharing to send well let
me stop sharing for the moment and i

950
00:23:59,909 --> 00:23:59,919
me stop sharing for the moment and i
 

951
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,789
me stop sharing for the moment and i
said some toys some tokens yeah

952
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:02,799
said some toys some tokens yeah
 

953
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:14,230
said some toys some tokens yeah
uh

954
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,240

 

955
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,590

in just a moment

956
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,600

 

957
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:36,149

them

958
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:36,159

 

959
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,510

i think

960
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:37,520
i think
 

961
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,190
i think
they will arrive soon

962
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200

 

963
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,750

probably i'll close this instance and

964
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:43,760
probably i'll close this instance and
 

965
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:50,710
probably i'll close this instance and
reshape the screen again

966
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:50,720

 

967
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,230

so let's try one more time

968
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,240
so let's try one more time
 

969
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,590
so let's try one more time
by testing

970
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:55,600
by testing
 

971
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,470
by testing
you see if you don't have a

972
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,480
you see if you don't have a
 

973
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,470
you see if you don't have a
flex client deployed

974
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
flex client deployed
 

975
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,750
flex client deployed
and

976
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:01,760
and
 

977
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,160
and
the bot will

978
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,170
the bot will
 

979
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,630
the bot will
[Music]

980
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:04,640
[Music]
 

981
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,549
[Music]
ask you to deploy the client first

982
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:10,559

 

983
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,269

but i am happy to have the client deploy

984
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:13,279
but i am happy to have the client deploy
 

985
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,590
but i am happy to have the client deploy
they hopefully enough balance

986
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:17,600

 

987
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,909

okay now it's okay
 

989
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,470
okay now it's okay
uh you see that uh

990
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:22,480
uh you see that uh
 

991
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,149
uh you see that uh
this bar will cost me 1.8 tons so the

992
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,159
this bar will cost me 1.8 tons so the
 

993
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:26,950
this bar will cost me 1.8 tons so the
bot

994
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:26,960
bot
 

995
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,950
bot
adds a

996
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:28,960
adds a
 

997
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,870
adds a
one and a half token

998
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:30,880
one and a half token
 

999
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,590
one and a half token
uh on top of the total sum

1000
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600
uh on top of the total sum
 

1001

00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:12,960
volume of trade for the interval as well
 

1221
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,870
volume of trade for the interval as well
a bit of interactivity uh on the

1222
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:16,880
a bit of interactivity uh on the
 

1223
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,990
a bit of interactivity uh on the
other book we don't have a

1224
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,000
other book we don't have a
 

1225
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,470
other book we don't have a
a large auto book here because the the

1226
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:22,480
a large auto book here because the the
 

1227
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,470
a large auto book here because the the
boat con

1228
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:24,480
boat con
 

1229
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,430
boat con
trades with itself all the time so

1230
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:27,440
trades with itself all the time so
 

1231
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,710
trades with itself all the time so
whenever the orders appear they

1232
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:30,720
whenever the orders appear they
 

1233
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,590
whenever the orders appear they
uh

1234
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:31,600
uh
 

1235
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,350
uh
they have been traded

1236
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:33,360
they have been traded
 

1237
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,230
they have been traded
almost momentarily there is some trade

1238
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,240
almost momentarily there is some trade
 

1239
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,870
almost momentarily there is some trade
history that's a lot we're not going to

1240
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:38,880
history that's a lot we're not going to
 

1241
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,590
history that's a lot we're not going to
trade with the board let's

1242
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:41,600
trade with the board let's
 

1243
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,470
trade with the board let's
let's it enjoy itself

1244
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,480
let's it enjoy itself
 

1245
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,830
let's it enjoy itself
i

1246
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:45,840
i
 

1247
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,950
i
i prefer uh to demonstrate you another

1248
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:48,960
i prefer uh to demonstrate you another
 

1249
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,470
i prefer uh to demonstrate you another
very important uh example is the

1250
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:52,480
very important uh example is the
 

1251
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,510
very important uh example is the
demonstration of trading with amen

1252
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:55,520
demonstration of trading with amen
 

1253
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,549
demonstration of trading with amen
so

1254
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:56,559
so
 

1255
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,470
so
media already

1256
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:00,480

 

1257
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,789

discussed it automatically

1258
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:02,799
discussed it automatically
 

1259
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,470
discussed it automatically
there

1260
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:04,480
there
 

1261
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,950
there
a question from the audience so uh uh

1262
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:06,960
a question from the audience so uh uh
 

1263
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,430
a question from the audience so uh uh
why when buying at the price of

1264
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:10,440
why when buying at the price of
 

1265
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,430
why when buying at the price of
0.10001 the cheaper books at 0.1 and

1266
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:14,440
0.10001 the cheaper books at 0.1 and
 

1267
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,830
0.10001 the cheaper books at 0.1 and
0.05 were not filled first so um

1268
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:19,840
0.05 were not filled first so um
 

1269
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,389
0.05 were not filled first so um
can you comment on this please as well

1270
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:22,399
can you comment on this please as well
 

1271
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,909
can you comment on this please as well
because there was no debot or any um

1272
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:25,919
because there was no debot or any um
 

1273
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,070
because there was no debot or any um
like program that executed that strategy

1274
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,080
like program that executed that strategy
 

1275
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,830
like program that executed that strategy
on this order book

1276
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:29,840
on this order book
 

1277
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,070
on this order book
and if if you want to fill if you want

1278
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,080
and if if you want to fill if you want
 

1279
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,750
and if if you want to fill if you want
to create a strategy over order book you

1280
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:33,760
to create a strategy over order book you
 

1281
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,269
to create a strategy over order book you
need to have an algorithm which executes

1282
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:35,279
need to have an algorithm which executes
 

1283
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,110
need to have an algorithm which executes
the strategy so you can for example make

1284
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,120
the strategy so you can for example make
 

1285
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,870
the strategy so you can for example make
a like a like a just a server program

1286
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:40,880
a like a like a just a server program
 

1287
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,110
a like a like a just a server program
for example you can make also a

1288
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,120
for example you can make also a
 

1289
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,110
for example you can make also a
automatic program that you will see now

1290
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,120
automatic program that you will see now
 

1291
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,830
automatic program that you will see now
but you can have a like a solar program

1292
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:47,840
but you can have a like a solar program
 

1293
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,389
but you can have a like a solar program
which would monitor the prices of the of

1294
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:50,399
which would monitor the prices of the of
 

1295
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,269
which would monitor the prices of the of

and execute whatever strategy you want
 

1303
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,190
and execute whatever strategy you want
and you can

1304
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:57,200
and you can
 

1305
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,590
and you can
fill order you can you know whatever

1306
00:31:59,590 --> 00:31:59,600
fill order you can you know whatever
 

1307
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,430

like execute whatever strategy you want

1308
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:01,440
like execute whatever strategy you want
 

1309
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,509
like execute whatever strategy you want
over the over the order book

1310
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:03,519
over the over the order book
 

1311
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,310
over the over the order book
just because it's totally atomic the

1312
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:06,320
just because it's totally atomic the
 

1313
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,549
just because it's totally atomic the
order book itself doesn't have logic you

1314
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:08,559
order book itself doesn't have logic you
 

1315
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,149
order book itself doesn't have logic you
need to create a logic on top of the

1316
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:10,159
need to create a logic on top of the
 

1317
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,590
need to create a logic on top of the
order book if you want to do anything

1318
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:11,600
order book if you want to do anything
 

1319
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,110
order book if you want to do anything
but you can do anything you want

1320
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,120
but you can do anything you want
 

1321
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,990
but you can do anything you want
basically yeah sure

1322
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,000
basically yeah sure
 

1323
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,870
basically yeah sure
okay thank you yeah the price is atomic

1324
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:18,880
okay thank you yeah the price is atomic
 

1325
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,750
okay thank you yeah the price is atomic
object

1326
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:19,760
object
 

1327
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,669
object
on flex and uh but the flex debot has

1328
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:23,679
on flex and uh but the flex debot has
 

1329
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,470
on flex and uh but the flex debot has
the entire autobook

1330
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:26,480
the entire autobook
 

1331
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,350
the entire autobook
known

1332
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360
known
 

1333
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,750
known
so basically we can

1334
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:29,760
so basically we can
 

1335
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,110
so basically we can
trade with specific prices or

1336
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:33,120
trade with specific prices or
 

1337
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,870
trade with specific prices or
basically the

1338
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:34,880
basically the
 

1339
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,389
basically the
uh

1340
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:36,399
uh
 

1341
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,350
uh
flex debate level we can create

1342
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,360
flex debate level we can create
 

1343
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,950
flex debate level we can create
more complex

1344
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:40,960
more complex
 

1345
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,070
more complex
orders not just buy and sell but for

1346
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,080
orders not just buy and sell but for
 

1347
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,789
orders not just buy and sell but for
example at a specific price specific

1348
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:46,799
example at a specific price specific
 

1349
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,549
example at a specific price specific
volume but

1350
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:48,559
volume but
 

1351
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,070
volume but
like

1352
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,080
like
 

1353
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,710
like
market orders when i want to buy a

1354
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:52,720
market orders when i want to buy a
 

1355

00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,080
price and the price is in the autobook
 

1359
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,230
price and the price is in the autobook
available and they both just

1360
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,240
available and they both just
 

1361
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,710
available and they both just
buy start

1362
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:02,720
buy start
 

1363

buying at the best price and go up to

1364
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:04,880
buying at the best price and go up to
 

1365
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,269
buying at the best price and go up to
them

1366
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:07,279

 

1367
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,149

on the other book so we're planning to

1368
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:10,159
on the other book so we're planning to
 

1369
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,269
on the other book so we're planning to
realize

1370
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:11,279
realize
 

1371
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,509
realize
market orders

1372
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:13,519
market orders
 

1373
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,029
market orders
and

1374
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:15,039
and
 

1375
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,430
and
you see

1376
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:17,440

 

1377
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,990

it's possible to make

1378
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,000
it's possible to make
 

1379
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,310
it's possible to make
the bots smart and smarter smart i

1380
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:22,320
the bots smart and smarter smart i
 

1381
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,470
the bots smart and smarter smart i
realize different strategies so

1382
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:24,480
realize different strategies so
 

1383
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,909
realize different strategies so
basically whenever you have the

1384
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:27,919
basically whenever you have the
 

1385
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,230
basically whenever you have the

and then you can implement any logic you
 

1431
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,349
and then you can implement any logic you
want and you also can do it off chain so

1721
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,990
working on that
right now

1722
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:26,000
right now
 

1723
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,230
right now
and there but there will be also like a

1724
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:28,240
and there but there will be also like a
 

1725
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,230
and there but there will be also like a
old template model for

1726
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:30,240
old template model for
 

1727
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,069
old template model for
governance tokens that you can launch

1728
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:32,079
governance tokens that you can launch
 

1729
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,710
governance tokens that you can launch
with your token because there is a logic

1730
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:34,720
with your token because there is a logic
 

1731
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,069
with your token because there is a logic
which already

1732
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:36,079
which already
 

1733
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,390
which already
includes in flex which are wrapper

1734
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:38,400
includes in flex which are wrapper
 

1735
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,109
includes in flex which are wrapper
logic so you can basically wrap any

1736
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:41,119
logic so you can basically wrap any
 

1737
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,430
logic so you can basically wrap any

the wallet
 

1809

the exchange
so like the tippery token wallet that

1814
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:05,119
so like the tippery token wallet that
 

1815
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,870
so like the tippery token wallet that
you have on the exchange is controlled

2077
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,710

definitely

2078
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:20,720
definitely
 

2079
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,349
definitely
but this is exactly the amm that we just

2080
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:23,359
but this is exactly the amm that we just
 

2081
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,069
but this is exactly the amm that we just
that you just see on your screen is the

2082
00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:26,079
that you just see on your screen is the
 

2083
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,990
that you just see on your screen is the
the order book that you just saw how

2084
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:28,000
the order book that you just saw how
 

2085
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,109
the order book that you just saw how
it's uh

2086
00:47:30,109 --> 00:47:30,119
it's uh
 

2087
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:32,630
it's uh
re-rearranged itself it's this is the

2088
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:32,640
re-rearranged itself it's this is the
 

2089
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,109
re-rearranged itself it's this is the
liquidity providing mechanism

2090
00:47:35,109 --> 00:47:35,119
liquidity providing mechanism
 

2091
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,589
liquidity providing mechanism
okay and what about maintaining users

2092
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:37,599
okay and what about maintaining users
 

2093
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,510
okay and what about maintaining users
like because as i remember it was the

2094
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:41,520
like because as i remember it was the
 

2095
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,390
like because as i remember it was the
part of the idea of having this third

2096
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:44,400
part of the idea of having this third
 

2097
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,829
part of the idea of having this third
stage like

2098
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:45,839
stage like
 

2099
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,430
stage like
maintaining users

2100
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:47,440
maintaining users
 

2101
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,829
maintaining users
like staking like farming like these

2102
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:50,839
like staking like farming like these
 

2103
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:53,510
like staking like farming like these
mechanisms there are no staking or

2104
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:53,520
mechanisms there are no staking or
 

2105
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,750
mechanisms there are no staking or
farming mechanisms in in in that

2106
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:55,760
farming mechanisms in in in that
 

2107
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,309
farming mechanisms in in in that
solution right now so that was that that

2108
00:47:58,309 --> 00:47:58,319
solution right now so that was that that
 

2109
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,069
solution right now so that was that that
isn't the part of the

2110
00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:00,079
isn't the part of the
 

2111
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,470
isn't the part of the
of this uh solution currently as i said

2112
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:02,480
of this uh solution currently as i said
 

2113
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,990
of this uh solution currently as i said
there will be like

2114
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,000
there will be like
 

2115
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,470
there will be like
we will work on that but the next stage

2116
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:06,480
we will work on that but the next stage
 

2117
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,549
we will work on that but the next stage
right now there are no governance tokens

2118
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:08,559
right now there are no governance tokens
 

2119
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,190
right now there are no governance tokens
or like liquidity things but you can you

in future and we have also several other
teams who have already

2258
00:50:44,069 --> 00:50:44,079
teams who have already
 

2259
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,390
teams who have already
uh

2260
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:46,400

 

2261

this contest so uh
this is something new so nobody has seen

2266
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:52,400
this is something new so nobody has seen
 

2267
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,430
this is something new so nobody has seen
this already so for four guys from 40

00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:55,440
this already so for four guys from 40
 

2269
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,710
this already so for four guys from 40
foot so it's also a novelty so actually

2270
00:50:58,710 --> 00:50:58,720
foot so it's also a novelty so actually
 

2271
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,430
foot so it's also a novelty so actually
uh what this contest uh

2272
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:01,440
uh what this contest uh
 

2273
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,270
uh what this contest uh
is about and how it will be structured

2274
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:03,280
is about and how it will be structured
 

2275
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,270
is about and how it will be structured
so traditionally we will start with the

2276
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:05,280
so traditionally we will start with the
 

2277
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,390
so traditionally we will start with the
architecture and design uh stage

2278
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:08,400
architecture and design uh stage
 

2279
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,270
architecture and design uh stage
and

2280
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:09,280
and
 

2281
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,030
and
one of the

2282
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:11,040
one of the
 

2283
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,430
one of the
new points here that were not

2284
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:13,440
new points here that were not
 

2285
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,190
new points here that were not
previously in our contest is a

2286
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:15,200
previously in our contest is a
 

2287
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,270
previously in our contest is a
requirement to

2288
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:17,280
requirement to
 

2289
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,190
requirement to
maximize the reusage of the already

2290
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:19,200
maximize the reusage of the already
 

2291
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,109
maximize the reusage of the already
existing solutions

2292
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:21,119
existing solutions
 

2293
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,829
existing solutions
so i even put this in the hot criteria

2294
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:23,839
so i even put this in the hot criteria
 

2295
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:27,589
so i even put this in the hot criteria
so uh because uh actually

2296
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:27,599
so uh because uh actually
 

2297
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,990
so uh because uh actually
this is something that we need to really

2298
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:30,000
this is something that we need to really
 

2299
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,390
this is something that we need to really
motivate because we have already created

2300
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:32,400
motivate because we have already created
 

2301
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,390
motivate because we have already created
a really really

2302
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:34,400
a really really
 

2303
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,030
a really really
well developed ecosystem and we want uh

2304
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:37,040
well developed ecosystem and we want uh
 

2305
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,230
well developed ecosystem and we want uh
each new contest to be relying on those

2306
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:40,240
each new contest to be relying on those
 

2307
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,750
each new contest to be relying on those
solutions that have previously been

2308
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:41,760
solutions that have previously been
 

2309
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,870
solutions that have previously been
developed

2310
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:42,880
developed
 

2311
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,790
developed
uh motivating

2312
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:44,800
uh motivating
 

2313
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,910
uh motivating
on its own so uh the developers of those

2314
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:47,920
on its own so uh the developers of those
 

2315
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,790
on its own so uh the developers of those
solutions to maintain them and

2316
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:50,800
solutions to maintain them and
 

2317
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,589
solutions to maintain them and
get

2318
00:51:51,589 --> 00:51:51,599
get
 

2319
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,589
get
some demand for these services and

2320
00:51:53,589 --> 00:51:53,599
some demand for these services and
 

2321
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:54,790
some demand for these services and
whatever

2322
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:54,800
whatever
 

2323
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,230
whatever
uh yeah so actually what the launch pad

2324
00:51:58,230 --> 00:51:58,240
uh yeah so actually what the launch pad
 

2325
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,069
uh yeah so actually what the launch pad
is about if you don't know so actually

2326
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:00,079
is about if you don't know so actually
 

2327
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,630
is about if you don't know so actually
this is a decentralized way of launching

2328
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:02,640
this is a decentralized way of launching
 

2329
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,230
this is a decentralized way of launching
a new projects with crowdfunding

2330
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:06,240
a new projects with crowdfunding
 

2331
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,270
a new projects with crowdfunding
uh however as you may know so when at

2332
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:09,280
uh however as you may know so when at
 

2333
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,470
uh however as you may know so when at
the

2334
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:10,480
the
 

2335
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,069
the
era of icos there were quite a lot of uh

2336
00:52:14,069 --> 00:52:14,079
era of icos there were quite a lot of uh
 

2337
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,710
era of icos there were quite a lot of uh
scammy projects that

2338
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:16,720
scammy projects that
 

2339
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,390
scammy projects that
actually didn't

2340
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:18,400
actually didn't
 

2341
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,829
actually didn't
uh

2342
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:19,839
uh
 

2343
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,230
uh
really deliver and they just took the

2344
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:22,240
really deliver and they just took the
 

2345
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,870
really deliver and they just took the
money of investors and went away so this

2346
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:24,880
money of investors and went away so this
 

2347
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,510
money of investors and went away so this
is not the case that we will tolerate

2348
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:27,520
is not the case that we will tolerate
 

2349
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,150
is not the case that we will tolerate
here actually and this is why

2350
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:30,160
here actually and this is why
 

2351
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,510
here actually and this is why
we uh

2352
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:31,520
we uh
 

2353
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,870
we uh
put here some requirements for

2354
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:34,880
put here some requirements for
 

2355
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,230
put here some requirements for
the control of the liquidity uh

2356
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:38,240
the control of the liquidity uh
 

2357
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,470
the control of the liquidity uh
through the vesting and through the

2358
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:40,480
through the vesting and through the
 

2359
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,109
through the vesting and through the
consensus of investors uh for

2360
00:52:45,109 --> 00:52:45,119
consensus of investors uh for
 

2361
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,430
consensus of investors uh for
uh releasing the next trench of the

2362
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:47,440
uh releasing the next trench of the
 

2363
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,589
uh releasing the next trench of the
vesting to to the project and the

2364
00:52:49,589 --> 00:52:49,599
vesting to to the project and the
 

2365
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,710
vesting to to the project and the
ability also to uh withdraw the funds if

2366
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:52,720
ability also to uh withdraw the funds if
 

2367
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,549
ability also to uh withdraw the funds if
the project didn't uh

2368
00:52:54,549 --> 00:52:54,559
the project didn't uh
 

2369
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,309
the project didn't uh
achieve uh the kp the next milestone kpi

2370
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:58,319
achieve uh the kp the next milestone kpi
 

2371
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,710
achieve uh the kp the next milestone kpi
and the investors uh at least will get a

2372
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:00,720
and the investors uh at least will get a
 

2373
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,549
and the investors uh at least will get a
part of the money back

2374
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:02,559
part of the money back
 

2375
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,510
part of the money back
uh

2376
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:03,520
uh
 

2377
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,390
uh
also what is in this uh contest is

2378
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:06,400
also what is in this uh contest is
 

2379
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,630
also what is in this uh contest is
actually about uh

2380
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:08,640
actually about uh
 

2381
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,190
actually about uh
mainly the architecture of how the

2382
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:11,200
mainly the architecture of how the
 

2383
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,990
mainly the architecture of how the
system will will be built and we also

2384
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:14,000
system will will be built and we also
 

2385
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,069
system will will be built and we also
insist that the system should be purely

2386
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:16,079
insist that the system should be purely
 

2387
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,190
insist that the system should be purely
on chain

2388
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:17,200
on chain
 

2389
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,510
on chain
so meaning that uh all the interfaces

2390
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:19,520
so meaning that uh all the interfaces
 

2391
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,190
so meaning that uh all the interfaces
and off-chain parts should be

2392
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:21,200
and off-chain parts should be
 

2393
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,589
and off-chain parts should be
supplementary and do not affect the

2394
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:23,599
supplementary and do not affect the
 

2395
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,230
supplementary and do not affect the
core functionality of the launch pad um

2396
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:26,240
core functionality of the launch pad um
 

2397
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,069
core functionality of the launch pad um
and

2398
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:28,079
and
 

2399
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,829
and
they can help they can add some

2400
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:29,839
they can help they can add some
 

2401
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,549
they can help they can add some
convenience but if we take out all the

2402
00:53:32,549 --> 00:53:32,559
convenience but if we take out all the
 

2403
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,790
convenience but if we take out all the
off-chain parts and all the interfaces

2404
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:34,800
off-chain parts and all the interfaces
 

2405
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,750
off-chain parts and all the interfaces
uh you should be able to uh

2406
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:37,760
uh you should be able to uh
 

2407
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,910
uh you should be able to uh
really do everything you need with this

2408
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:39,920
really do everything you need with this
 

2409
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,390
really do everything you need with this
launchpad only through

2410
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:42,400
launchpad only through
 

2411
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,309
launchpad only through
i don't know a ton of cli calls

2412

01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:10,480
liquidity on initial stage and
 

2827
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,750
liquidity on initial stage and
sell it after the

2828
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:13,760

 

2829
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,670

on the stage where

2830
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:15,680
on the stage where
 

2831
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,069

the token sale stage
 

2833
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:20,470
the token sale stage
so the same with us uh in this way we

2834
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:20,480
so the same with us uh in this way we
 

2835
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,630
so the same with us uh in this way we
are going to uh

2836
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:22,640
are going to uh
 

2837
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,710
are going to uh
make money on it and

01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:24,720
make money on it and
 

2839
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,470
make money on it and
but the uh main idea is to

2840
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:28,480
but the uh main idea is to
 

2841
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,630
but the uh main idea is to
recognize existing uh in-game currencies

2842
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:32,640
recognize existing uh in-game currencies
 

2843
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,750
recognize existing uh in-game currencies
and

2844
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:33,760
and
 

2845
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,029
and
this idea is much uh

2846
01:02:37,029 --> 01:02:37,039
this idea is much uh
 

2847
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:39,349
this idea is much uh
interesting for us because in this case

2848
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:39,359
interesting for us because in this case
 

2849
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,549
interesting for us because in this case
we will get

2850
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:40,559
we will get
 

2851
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,230
we will get
pure uh

2852
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:42,240
pure uh
 

2853
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,789
pure uh
utility token nobody will say that this

2854
01:02:44,789 --> 01:02:44,799
utility token nobody will say that this
 

2855
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:47,190
utility token nobody will say that this
is security so this is pure utility

2856
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:47,200
is security so this is pure utility
 

2857
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,510
is security so this is pure utility
token which

2858
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:49,520
token which
 

2859
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,589
token which
can be distributed free of charge

2860
01:02:53,589 --> 01:02:53,599
can be distributed free of charge
 

2861
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:56,630
can be distributed free of charge
inside the game like uh

2862
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:56,640
inside the game like uh
 

2863

to
crypto infrastructure but

3584
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:30,400
crypto infrastructure but
 

3585
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:34,149
crypto infrastructure but
who would buy it and for what reason

3586
01:18:34,149 --> 01:18:34,159
who would buy it and for what reason
 

3587

i mean it doesn't have any use case
 

3597
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,870
i mean it doesn't have any use case
outside of the game

3598

3612
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:11,120

 

3613
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:15,270

we already seen a lot of use cases where

3614
01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:15,280
we already seen a lot of use cases where
 

3615
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,830
we already seen a lot of use cases where
in-game assets try to

3616
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:17,840
in-game assets try to
 

3617
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,229
in-game assets try to
solve in the real world for real money

3618
01:19:20,229 --> 01:19:20,239
solve in the real world for real money
 

3619
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:22,790
solve in the real world for real money
without any tokens

3620
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:22,800
without any tokens
 

3621
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,390
without any tokens
and

3622
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:24,400
and
 

3623
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,070
and
i think

3624
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:26,080
i think
 

3625
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,630
i think
it's a question of amount of liquidity

3626
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:28,640
it's a question of amount of liquidity
 

3627
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,790
it's a question of amount of liquidity
in this game so

3628
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:30,800
in this game so
 

3629
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,070
in this game so
think about

3630
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:32,080
think about
 

3631
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,310
think about
like airplane

3632
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:34,320
like airplane
 

3633
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,270
like airplane

3727
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,270
uh
the the question you ask it's the basic

3728
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:35,280
the the question you ask it's the basic
 

3729
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,950
the the question you ask it's the basic
demand question

3730
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:36,960
demand question
 

3731
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,950
demand question
so if the gamers

3732
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:38,960
so if the gamers
 

3733
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,629
so if the gamers
will be able to earn on crypto they will

3734
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:42,639
will be able to earn on crypto they will
 

3735
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:46,470
will be able to earn on crypto they will
they definitely want to buy more of it

3736
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:46,480
they definitely want to buy more of it
 

3737
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:47,590
they definitely want to buy more of it
and

3738
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:47,600
and
 

3739
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:51,110
and
uh one more import important notice is

3740
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:51,120
uh one more import important notice is
 

3741
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,470
uh one more import important notice is
that

3742
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:52,480
that
 

3743
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,430

to the token they will launch with us
 

3755
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:15,189
to the token they will launch with us
so it should not be one-to-one ratio and

3756
01:22:15,189 --> 01:22:15,199
so it should not be one-to-one ratio and
 

3757

so it should not be one-to-one ratio and
it doesn't mean that

it doesn't mean that
 

3759
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,910
it doesn't mean that
the demand will be zero

3760
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:19,920
the demand will be zero
 

3761
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,590
the demand will be zero
and the demand

3817
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,990
and they will have to develop in-game
mechanics so we won't develop in game

3818
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:36,000
mechanics so we won't develop in game
 

3819
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,470
