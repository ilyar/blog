823
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,270
i don't think it will be a bad thing i
think it's inevitable and we'll just

824
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,280
think it's inevitable and we'll just
 

825
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,950
think it's inevitable and we'll just
have to work around it

826
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:22,960
have to work around it
 

827
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,029
have to work around it
okay thank you and um another question i

828
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:25,039
okay thank you and um another question i
 

829
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,830
okay thank you and um another question i
really have in my mind is about

830
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:27,840
really have in my mind is about
 

831
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,470
really have in my mind is about
what a typical

832
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,480
what a typical
 

833
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,909
what a typical
vectors of attack by government agencies

834
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:33,919
vectors of attack by government agencies
 

835
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,390
vectors of attack by government agencies
will be on the default operators so

836
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:36,400
will be on the default operators so
 

837
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,470
will be on the default operators so
because as you say

838
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480
because as you say
 

839
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,230
because as you say
they are just a combination of smart

840
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240
they are just a combination of smart
 

841
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,270
they are just a combination of smart
contracts and at maximum they provide

842
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280

some front ends to those smart contracts
 

845
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,110
some front ends to those smart contracts
and even if a company that stays behind

846
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,120
and even if a company that stays behind
 

847
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,590
and even if a company that stays behind
the front end will disappear or be

848
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:51,600
the front end will disappear or be
 

849
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,310
the front end will disappear or be
blocked in certain uh regulations

850
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,320
blocked in certain uh regulations

aml rules yeah
 

883
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,590
aml rules yeah
that's

884
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:29,600
that's
 

885
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,750
that's
that's a good question um i don't know

886
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
that's a good question um i don't know
 

887
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,350
that's a good question um i don't know
if i have uh

888
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
if i have uh
 

889
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,789
if i have uh
you know

890
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:34,799
you know
 

891
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,710
you know
the correct answer

892
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720
the correct answer
 

893
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,750
the correct answer
uh but my thinking is that you know we

894
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:39,760
uh but my thinking is that you know we
 

895
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,350
uh but my thinking is that you know we
already see

896
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:41,360
already see
 

897
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,549
already see
how

898
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:42,559
how
 

899
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,750
how
uh

900
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:43,760
uh
 

901
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,710
uh
certain agencies from us

902
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
certain agencies from us
 

903
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,950
certain agencies from us
started to block

904
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:48,960
started to block
 

905
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,830
started to block
certain wallets of certain d5 projects

906
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840
certain wallets of certain d5 projects
 

907
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,430
certain wallets of certain d5 projects
i honestly

908
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440
i honestly
 

909
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,029
i honestly
not sure

910
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:57,039
not sure
 

911
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,590
not sure
how that would

912
00:21:59,590 --> 00:21:59,600
how that would
 

913
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,270
how that would
you know stop

914
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,280
you know stop
 

915
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,230
you know stop
uh

916
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,240
uh
 

917
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,310
uh
you know the same companies or doing you

918
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:04,320
you know the same companies or doing you
 

919
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,270
you know the same companies or doing you
know similar similar activities

920
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:07,280
know similar similar activities
 

921
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,270
know similar similar activities
because essentially i mean they

922
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:09,280
because essentially i mean they
 

923
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,190
because essentially i mean they
they take the ownership of the private

924
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:11,200
they take the ownership of the private
 

925
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,549
they take the ownership of the private
keys or where they they block the work

926
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:14,559
keys or where they they block the work
 

927
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,510
keys or where they they block the work
they sorry they block operation of

928
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
they sorry they block operation of
 

929
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,870
they sorry they block operation of
of those projects by confiscating the

930
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:20,880
of those projects by confiscating the
 

931
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,270
of those projects by confiscating the
private keys which is which sounds like

932
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:23,280
private keys which is which sounds like
 

933
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,630
private keys which is which sounds like
like i don't know

934
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:24,640
like i don't know
 

935
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,909
like i don't know
it's

936
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:27,919

 

937
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,029

actually

938
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:29,039
actually
 

939
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,510

and secondly like
 

943
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,070
and secondly like
well the anonymizing of wallets is

944
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080
well the anonymizing of wallets is
 

945
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,750
well the anonymizing of wallets is
already happening

946
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:37,760
already happening
 

947
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,710
already happening
i mean

948
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:38,720
i mean
 

949
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,590
i mean
take take take into account

950
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:41,600
take take take into account
 

951
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,470
take take take into account
you know that the that chain analysis

952
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:44,480
you know that the that chain analysis
 

953
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,549
you know that the that chain analysis
is only worth

954
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:46,559
is only worth
 

955
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,430
is only worth
a few billion of dollars uh because of

956
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:49,440
a few billion of dollars uh because of
 

957
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,590
a few billion of dollars uh because of
the governmental contracts

958
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:51,600
the governmental contracts
 

959
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,909
the governmental contracts
yeah absolutely and there and there's

960
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:53,919
yeah absolutely and there and there's
 

961
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,590
yeah absolutely and there and there's
and their system is actually very

962
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:55,600
and their system is actually very
 

963
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,430
and their system is actually very
sophisticated

964
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
sophisticated
 

965
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,950
sophisticated
we we tested till uh we tested uh i

966
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
we we tested till uh we tested uh i
 

967
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,830
we we tested till uh we tested uh i
cannot well i'm not gonna name again the

968
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:03,840
cannot well i'm not gonna name again the
 

969

cannot well i'm not gonna name again the
companies because i don't want to create

00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:05,440
companies because i don't want to create
 

971
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,230
companies because i don't want to create
any

972
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,240
any
 

973
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,390
any
issues for us in the future

974
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
issues for us in the future
 

975
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,590
issues for us in the future
we we basically work with aml service

976
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:11,600
we we basically work with aml service
 

977
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,270
we we basically work with aml service
providers and utilize their tech

978
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,280
providers and utilize their tech
 

979
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,789
providers and utilize their tech
and we can

980
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:16,799
and we can
 

981
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,950
and we can
in real time we screen the wallets and

982
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:18,960
in real time we screen the wallets and
 

983
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,390
in real time we screen the wallets and
transactions

984
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:20,400
transactions
 

985
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,270
transactions
and we compare different aml service

986
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,280
and we compare different aml service
 

987
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,470
and we compare different aml service
providers

988
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:24,480
providers
 

989
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,149
providers
and what the result is

990
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
and what the result is
 

991
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,430
and what the result is
we see that

992
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,440
we see that
 

993
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,110
we see that
um tier one or the major i would say

994
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,120
um tier one or the major i would say
 

995
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,149
um tier one or the major i would say
three four five ml service providers

996
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:34,159
three four five ml service providers
 

997
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,029
three four five ml service providers
um

998
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:35,039
um
 

999
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,070
um
again i don't want to publicly you know

1000
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,080
again i don't want to publicly you know
 

1001
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,990
again i don't want to publicly you know
say the names because that would create

1002
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000
say the names because that would create
 

1003
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,110
say the names because that would create
certain

1004
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120
certain
 

1005
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,909
certain
um

1006
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:41,919
um
 

1007
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,390
um
negativity potentially but anyway

1008
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,400
negativity potentially but anyway
 

1009
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,390
negativity potentially but anyway
um they look they don't like to be

1010
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:46,400
um they look they don't like to be
 

1011
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,710
um they look they don't like to be
compared none of them but we compare

1012
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:48,720
compared none of them but we compare
 

1013
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,710
compared none of them but we compare
them and we see that

1014
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:50,720
them and we see that
 

1015
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,789
them and we see that
one service provider

1016
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
one service provider
 

1017
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,269
one service provider
and their result is absolutely like

1018
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:55,279
and their result is absolutely like
 

1019
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,430
and their result is absolutely like
completely different from another so

1020
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:57,440
completely different from another so
 

1021
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,630
completely different from another so
there is no

1022
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:58,640
there is no
 

1023
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,110
there is no
um i would say there is no

1024
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,120
um i would say there is no
 

1025
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,549
um i would say there is no
um benchmark probably exactly yeah there

1026
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:04,559
um benchmark probably exactly yeah there
 

1027
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,110
um benchmark probably exactly yeah there
is no benchmark there is no

1028
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,120
is no benchmark there is no
 

1029
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,149
is no benchmark there is no
black or black or white yet there is no

we see that

1034
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,200
we see that
 

1035
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,750
we see that
uh an organization

uh incorrect just because the regulators

1124
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:09,039
uh incorrect just because the regulators
 

1125
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,190
uh incorrect just because the regulators

uh the axes are

1132
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,200
uh the axes are
 

1133
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,750
uh the axes are
time to time used as a big mixers

1134
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:21,760
time to time used as a big mixers
 

1135
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,830
time to time used as a big mixers
that's true and

1136
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:23,840
that's true and
 

1137
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,789
that's true and
that's a raising issue in the world and

1138
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:26,799
that's a raising issue in the world and
 

1139
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,870
that's a raising issue in the world and
i don't really think that anyone can

1140
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:28,880
i don't really think that anyone can
 

1141
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,350
i don't really think that anyone can
block them yeah because

1142
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:31,360
block them yeah because
 

1143
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,750
block them yeah because
the only way to block all this smart

1144
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:33,760
the only way to block all this smart
 

1145
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,390
the only way to block all this smart
contracts execution is uh just by

1146
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:36,400
contracts execution is uh just by
 

1147
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,390
contracts execution is uh just by
stopping the network so

1148
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
stopping the network so
 

1149
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,310
stopping the network so
this is the only reliable

1150
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,320
this is the only reliable
 

1151
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,750
this is the only reliable
way to do this but you cannot stall for

1152
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:43,760
way to do this but you cannot stall for
 

1153
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,750
way to do this but you cannot stall for
example ethereum

1154
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:45,760

because there are so many nodes that

1156
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:47,440
because there are so many nodes that
 

1157
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,669
because there are so many nodes that
support its work

1158
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679
support its work
 

1159
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,269
support its work
so

1160
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:51,279
so
 

1161
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,549
so
that means that uh aml services for for

1162
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:54,559
that means that uh aml services for for
 

1163
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,710
that means that uh aml services for for
d5 products um

1164
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:56,720
d5 products um
 

1165
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,909
d5 products um
are more like a reputational uh step

1166
00:26:59,909 --> 00:26:59,919
are more like a reputational uh step
 

1167
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,549
are more like a reputational uh step
that uh uh shows to

1168
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:02,559
that uh uh shows to
 

1169
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,310
that uh uh shows to
a big

you know like a high risk um

1222
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,000
you know like a high risk um
 

1223
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,750
you know like a high risk um
entity or or you know a person

1224
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:07,760
entity or or you know a person
 

1225
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,310
entity or or you know a person
but is essentially regulators are

1226
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,320
but is essentially regulators are
 

1227
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,789
but is essentially regulators are
counting on analytics data taken from

1228
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:12,799
counting on analytics data taken from
 

1229
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,669
counting on analytics data taken from
aml service providers and a ml service

aml service providers and a ml service
 

1231
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,149
aml service providers and a ml service
providers don't know about how to

1232
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:18,159
providers don't know about how to
 

1233
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,190
providers don't know about how to
regulate

1234
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
regulate
 

1235
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,990
regulate
uh how to analyze transactions

1236
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,000
uh how to analyze transactions
 

1237
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,269
uh how to analyze transactions
absolutely within within d5 i'm not

1238
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:25,279
absolutely within within d5 i'm not
 

1239
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,110
absolutely within within d5 i'm not
talking about like

1240
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,120
talking about like
 

1241
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,830
talking about like
analyzing the

1242
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:28,840
analyzing the
 

1243
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,110
analyzing the
transactions that

1244
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,120
transactions that
 

1245
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,190
transactions that
are happening inside the decks

1246
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:33,200
are happening inside the decks
 

1247
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,430
are happening inside the decks
which is doable but which is but but

1248
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:35,440
which is doable but which is but but
 

1249
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,870
which is doable but which is but but
very complicated

1250
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:36,880
very complicated
 

1251
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,750
very complicated
but also like

1252
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:39,760
but also like
 

1253
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,470
but also like
for them what is really rocket science

1254
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:42,480
for them what is really rocket science
 

1255
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,269
for them what is really rocket science
is is trying to

1264
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,240
system that will
 

1265
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,590
system that will
essentially

1266
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:55,600

 

1267
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,630

unfold what's really going on inside the

mixers
 

1271
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,389
mixers
there are ways how

1272
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:04,399
there are ways how
 

1273
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,269
there are ways how
you know you can kind of like

1274
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:07,279
you know you can kind of like
 

1275
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,510
you know you can kind of like
associate certain transaction

1276
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:09,520
associate certain transaction
 

1277
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,350
associate certain transaction
when it goes in and out

1278
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:11,360
when it goes in and out
 

1279
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,070
when it goes in and out
there is no hundred percent and for them

1280
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,080
there is no hundred percent and for them
 

1281
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,110
there is no hundred percent and for them
this is kind of like they have to go in

1282
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,120
this is kind of like they have to go in
 

1283
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,310
this is kind of like they have to go in
i don't know

1284
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:18,320
i don't know
 

1285
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,950
i don't know

00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:22,559
terms of technical development to
 

1289
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,230
terms of technical development to
understand that because right now a

1290
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:24,240
understand that because right now a
 

1291
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,269
understand that because right now a
single a simple transaction can be

1292
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:27,279
single a simple transaction can be
 

1293
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,310
single a simple transaction can be
um

1294
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:28,320
um
 

1295
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,190
um
you know

1296
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,200
you know
 

1297
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,590
you know
viewed or labeled as high risk for no

1298
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:31,600
viewed or labeled as high risk for no
 

1299
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,789
viewed or labeled as high risk for no
reason

1300
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:32,799
reason
 

1301
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,470
reason
so there is like

1302
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:34,480
so there is like
 

1303
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,789
so there is like
we realized that when we started working

1304
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:36,799
we realized that when we started working
 

1305
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,269
we realized that when we started working
with you know different ml service

1306
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:39,279
with you know different ml service
 

1307
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,909
with you know different ml service
providers different databases

1308
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:41,919
providers different databases
 

1309
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,630
providers different databases
and we realized like you know if we were

1310
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:44,640
and we realized like you know if we were
 

1311
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,990
and we realized like you know if we were
really to

1312
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,000
really to
 

1313
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,389
really to
build up a system that would

1314
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:48,399
build up a system that would
 

1315
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,310
build up a system that would
uh really help

1316
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:50,320
uh really help
 

1317
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,990
uh really help
um

1318
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,000
um
 

1319
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,430
um
individual investors or or organizations

1320
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:55,440
individual investors or or organizations
 

1321
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,230
individual investors or or organizations
to say hey actual our risk score is not

1322
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,240
to say hey actual our risk score is not
 

1323
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,269
to say hey actual our risk score is not
10 or is not like 80 percent

1324
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:01,279
10 or is not like 80 percent
 

1325
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,750
10 or is not like 80 percent
uh we're actually we have the mlk oscs

1326
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:03,760
uh we're actually we have the mlk oscs
 

1327
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,669
uh we're actually we have the mlk oscs
and stuff so we hope that

1328
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:05,679
and stuff so we hope that
 

1329
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,990
and stuff so we hope that
the system that we're that we that we're

1330
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,000
the system that we're that we that we're
 

1331
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,950
the system that we're that we that we're
building

1332
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:08,960
building
 

1333
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,789
building
will also enable

1334
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:10,799
will also enable
 

1335
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,070
will also enable
the reverse engineer uh that's risk

1336
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,080
the reverse engineer uh that's risk
 

1337
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,710
the reverse engineer uh that's risk
score for the entities who want to

1338
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:16,720
score for the entities who want to
 

1339
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,190
score for the entities who want to
implement that and go talk to a ml

1340
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:19,200
implement that and go talk to a ml
 

1341
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,950
implement that and go talk to a ml
service provider and say hey this is

1342
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:20,960
service provider and say hey this is
 

1343
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,950
service provider and say hey this is
actually not a risk like high risk

1344
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:22,960
actually not a risk like high risk
 

1345
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,230
actually not a risk like high risk
transaction

1346

transaction
 

1347
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,350
transaction
and for them again like aml is one thing

1348
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:27,360
and for them again like aml is one thing
 

1349
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,750
and for them again like aml is one thing
which is which is what which is what is

1350
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:29,760
which is which is what which is what is
 

1351
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,430
which is which is what which is what is
important at this

1352
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:31,440
important at this
 

1353
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,110
important at this
like

1354
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,120
like
 

1355
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,230
like
right now

1356
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,240
right now
 

1357
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,070
right now
but further down the road there also

1358
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,080
but further down the road there also
 

1359
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,510
but further down the road there also
have to be

1360
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:37,520
have to be
 

1361
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,669
have to be
i i expect uh

1362
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:39,679
i i expect uh
 

1363
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,830
i i expect uh
i don't like it but i expect that the

1364
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:41,840
i don't like it but i expect that the
 

1365
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,630
i don't like it but i expect that the
kyc will have to be in place as well

1366
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:44,640
kyc will have to be in place as well
 

1367
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,389
kyc will have to be in place as well
and that's a whole different ballpark

1368
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:46,399
and that's a whole different ballpark
 

1369
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,310
and that's a whole different ballpark
kyc and uh

1370
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:48,320
kyc and uh
 

1371
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,389
kyc and uh
i like it only because

1372
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:50,399
i like it only because
 

1373
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,990
i like it only because
we we will essentially come from web 2.3

1374
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,000
we we will essentially come from web 2.3
 

1375
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,710
we we will essentially come from web 2.3
to

systems
 

1383
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,870
systems
uh and kyc have to be in place and i

1384
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:04,880
uh and kyc have to be in place and i
 

1385

know stephan here is already kind of

1386
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:06,799
know stephan here is already kind of
 

1387
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,870
know stephan here is already kind of
like yeah yeah not only but also

1388

the problem is that even if we um

1856
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:16,640
the problem is that even if we um
 

1857
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,829
the problem is that even if we um
integrate on a layer one

1858

part of this

2682
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:46,559
part of this
 

2683
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,510
part of this
solution so there's been two two

2684
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:49,520
solution so there's been two two
 

2685
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,430
solution so there's been two two
submissions there

2686
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:51,440
submissions there
 

2687
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,829
submissions there
which are

2688
00:57:52,829 --> 00:57:52,839
which are
 

2689
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:56,630
which are
well let's say they're suboptimal

2690
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:56,640
well let's say they're suboptimal
 

2691
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,630
well let's say they're suboptimal
and

2692
00:57:58,630 --> 00:57:58,640
and
 

2693
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,150
and
yeah it's really

2694
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:00,160
yeah it's really
 

2695
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,270
yeah it's really
it's really hard to tell that from the

2696
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:03,280
it's really hard to tell that from the
 

2697
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,150
it's really hard to tell that from the
jurors

2698
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:06,160

 

2699
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,549

votes on those submissions but if you

2700
00:58:08,549 --> 00:58:08,559
votes on those submissions but if you
 

2701
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:09,829
votes on those submissions but if you
dive deeper

2702
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:09,839
dive deeper
 

2703
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,150
dive deeper
it will be quite obvious that

2704
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:12,160
it will be quite obvious that
 

2705
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,430
it will be quite obvious that
well

2706
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:13,440
well
 

2707
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,549
well
there is um

2708
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:16,559

 

2709
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,190

a ready product cannot be made from this

2710
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:19,200
a ready product cannot be made from this
 

2711
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,069
a ready product cannot be made from this
so

2712
00:58:20,069 --> 00:58:20,079
so
 

2713
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,589
so
you you can't proceed with this

2714
00:58:21,589 --> 00:58:21,599
you you can't proceed with this
 

2715
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,589
you you can't proceed with this
architecture and uh

2716
00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:23,599
architecture and uh
 

2717
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:25,670
architecture and uh
of course it's a it's a complex topic

2718
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:25,680
of course it's a it's a complex topic
 

2719
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,870
of course it's a it's a complex topic
it's a it's a technical uh

2720
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:28,880
it's a it's a technical uh
 

2721
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,390
it's a it's a technical uh
it's there's a lot of technical stuff

2722
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:30,400
it's there's a lot of technical stuff
 

2723
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,549
it's there's a lot of technical stuff
not rocket science but i mean not rocket

2724
00:58:32,549 --> 00:58:32,559
not rocket science but i mean not rocket
 

2725
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,150
not rocket science but i mean not rocket
science at least for

2726
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:34,160
science at least for
 

2727
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,670

01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:37,280
interfaces it still can be done just
 

2925
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,390
interfaces it still can be done just
through the

peculiarities that uh
 

2955
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,910
peculiarities that uh
you will not be able to do this

2956
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:11,920
you will not be able to do this
 

2957
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,990
you will not be able to do this
without having specific experts and

2958
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:14,000
without having specific experts and
 

2959
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,950
without having specific experts and

2961
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,349

because we have run uh

2962
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:19,359
because we have run uh
 

2963
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:21,670
because we have run uh
already three or four audits security

2964
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:21,680
already three or four audits security
 

2965
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,710
already three or four audits security
audits of our solution to get the uh

2966
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:24,720
audits of our solution to get the uh
 

2967
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,910

uh

2968
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:25,920
uh
 

2969
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:26,870
uh
well

2970
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:26,880
well
 

2971
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,750
well
the level of security that we consider

2972
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:29,760
the level of security that we consider
 

2973
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,750
the level of security that we consider
sufficient yeah still there are some

2974
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:31,760
sufficient yeah still there are some
 

2975
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,069
sufficient yeah still there are some
minor bugs of course that will be fixed

2976
01:03:34,069 --> 01:03:34,079
minor bugs of course that will be fixed
 

2977
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,029
minor bugs of course that will be fixed
in the coming releases but they cannot

2978
01:03:37,029 --> 01:03:37,039
in the coming releases but they cannot
 

2979
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,069
in the coming releases but they cannot
lead to the stealing of funds or assets

2980
01:03:40,069 --> 01:03:40,079
lead to the stealing of funds or assets
 

2981
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:41,430
lead to the stealing of funds or assets
or interrupting the

2982
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:41,440
or interrupting the
 

2983
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,589
or interrupting the
work of the bridge

2984
01:03:43,589 --> 01:03:43,599
work of the bridge
 

2985
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:46,710
work of the bridge
but to do this so we had to really

2986
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:46,720
but to do this so we had to really
 

2987
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:47,829
but to do this so we had to really
invest

2988
01:03:47,829 --> 01:03:47,839
invest
 

2989
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,430
invest
the efforts of

2990
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:49,440
the efforts of
 

2991
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,910
the efforts of
more than 10 people for over the course

2992
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:51,920
more than 10 people for over the course
 

2993
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,950
more than 10 people for over the course
of uh six months so you can imagine the

2994
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:54,960
of uh six months so you can imagine the
 

2995
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,029
of uh six months so you can imagine the
level of complexity of this stuff so

2996
01:03:57,029 --> 01:03:57,039
level of complexity of this stuff so
 

2997
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,470
level of complexity of this stuff so
that's why uh

2998
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:58,480
that's why uh
 

2999
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,230
that's why uh
i personally think that the easiest way

3000
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:00,240
i personally think that the easiest way
 

3001
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,910
i personally think that the easiest way
to build the nft bridge is to just make

3002
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:03,920
to build the nft bridge is to just make
 

3003
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,230
to build the nft bridge is to just make
the expansion for the existent on bridge

3004
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:06,240
the expansion for the existent on bridge
 

3005
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:10,069
the expansion for the existent on bridge
io that will let you to uh to transfer a

3006
01:04:10,069 --> 01:04:10,079
io that will let you to uh to transfer a
 

3007
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,349
io that will let you to uh to transfer a
certain type of content and then you can

3008
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:13,359
certain type of content and then you can
 

3009
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:16,069
certain type of content and then you can
easily land all these nfts wherever you

3010
01:04:16,069 --> 01:04:16,079
easily land all these nfts wherever you
 

3011
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:17,589
easily land all these nfts wherever you
like

3012
01:04:17,589 --> 01:04:17,599
like
 

3013
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,670
like
uh yeah we'll discuss this also in

3014
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:19,680
uh yeah we'll discuss this also in
 

3015
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,230
uh yeah we'll discuss this also in
person with alex next week uh just to

3016
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:22,240
person with alex next week uh just to
 

3017
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:27,270
person with alex next week uh just to
get to dig into the details and um

3018
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:27,280
get to dig into the details and um
 

3019
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,510
get to dig into the details and um
for better understand so how how this

3020
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:29,520
for better understand so how how this
 

3021
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,390
for better understand so how how this
can

3022
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:30,400
can
 

3023
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,109
can
this should work actually

3024
01:04:33,109 --> 01:04:33,119
this should work actually
 

3025
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,029
this should work actually
yeah and you had some uh some other

3026
01:04:35,029 --> 01:04:35,039
yeah and you had some uh some other
 

3027

3031
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:42,870
that uh that we we know about um we know
about security because because it's it's

3032
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:42,880
about security because because it's it's

can

3072
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:34,400
can
 

3073
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,910
can
leverage this to to get liquidity

3074
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:37,920
leverage this to to get liquidity
 

3075
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,309
leverage this to to get liquidity
even if their stake is locked for a

this is why we're so obsessed with the
 

3085
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:48,549
this is why we're so obsessed with the
nft bridge as well because

3086
01:05:48,549 --> 01:05:48,559
nft bridge as well because
