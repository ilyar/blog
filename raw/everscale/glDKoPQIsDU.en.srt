uh in the real world the crypto landing
 

295
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,829
uh in the real world the crypto landing
and actually uh there are uh two

296

and actually uh there are uh two
 

297
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,829
and actually uh there are uh two
absolutely different areas that

298
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
absolutely different areas that
 

299
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,310
absolutely different areas that
that we're going to discuss so the first

300
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
that we're going to discuss so the first
 

301
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,269
that we're going to discuss so the first
one uh

302
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
one uh
 

303
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,630
one uh
is called collateralized lending uh it's

304
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
is called collateralized lending uh it's
 

305
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,990
is called collateralized lending uh it's
actually secured landing

306
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,000
actually secured landing
 

307
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,190
actually secured landing
in other words that uh you use

308
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,200
in other words that uh you use
 

309
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,310
in other words that uh you use
your own assets as a collateral to get

310
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
your own assets as a collateral to get
 

311
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,190
your own assets as a collateral to get
some other

312
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
some other
 

313
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,389
some other
assets that's pretty easy as it sounds

314
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
assets that's pretty easy as it sounds
 

315
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,949
assets that's pretty easy as it sounds
and another more complex and more

316
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:04,959
and another more complex and more
 

317
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,069
and another more complex and more
interesting topic is

318
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,079
interesting topic is
 

319
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,269
interesting topic is
uh the unsecured lending uh which

320
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
uh the unsecured lending uh which
 

321
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,870
uh the unsecured lending uh which
requires significantly

322
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
requires significantly
 

323
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,230
requires significantly
bigger infrastructure and

324
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
bigger infrastructure and
 

325
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,430
bigger infrastructure and
it will come in the later stages

326
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
it will come in the later stages
 

327
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,269
it will come in the later stages
but we will touch this also as well

328
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
but we will touch this also as well
 

329
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,870
but we will touch this also as well
uh so i would like to start

330

uh so i would like to start
 

331
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,670
uh so i would like to start
from just giving some some insights on

332
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
from just giving some some insights on
 

333
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,630
from just giving some some insights on
the market so

334
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,640
the market so
 

335
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,230
the market so
uh on active players uh and

336
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,240
uh on active players uh and
 

337
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,910
uh on active players uh and
who are currently uh in this market so

who are currently uh in this market so
 

339
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,829
who are currently uh in this market so
i will start from centralized

340
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
i will start from centralized
 

341
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,750
i will start from centralized
organizations and we will come

342
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:39,760
organizations and we will come
 

343
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,910
organizations and we will come
to the defy ones of course and

344
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920

 

345
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,949

we'll just uh explain a bit about

346
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
we'll just uh explain a bit about
 

347
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,550
we'll just uh explain a bit about
the how landing in defy world works

348
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
the how landing in defy world works
 

349
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,990
the how landing in defy world works
uh if you don't i didn't dig into it so

350
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
uh if you don't i didn't dig into it so
 

351
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,389
uh if you don't i didn't dig into it so
i found a couple of good articles

352
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
i found a couple of good articles
 

353
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,470
i found a couple of good articles
to tell about this so first of all

354
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
to tell about this so first of all
 

355
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,829
to tell about this so first of all
starting from centralized

356
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839
starting from centralized
 

357
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,750
starting from centralized
lending there are currently not that

358
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
lending there are currently not that
 

359
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,069
lending there are currently not that
many uh big organizations and

360
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
many uh big organizations and
 

361
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,990
many uh big organizations and
one of the biggest and the oldest one is

362
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
one of the biggest and the oldest one is
 

363
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,430
one of the biggest and the oldest one is
of course nexon

364
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,440
of course nexon
 

365
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,870
of course nexon
uh so they are currently more like a

366
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:10,880
uh so they are currently more like a
 

367
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,350
uh so they are currently more like a
bank

368
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
bank
 

369
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,110
bank
already and they even issue the

370
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
already and they even issue the
 

371
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,750
already and they even issue the
credit cards uh and give some other

372
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
credit cards uh and give some other
 

373
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,629
credit cards uh and give some other
products

374
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
products
 

375
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,990
products
but still they are centralized

376
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
but still they are centralized
 

377
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,389
but still they are centralized
centralized platform that require you to

378
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
centralized platform that require you to
 

379
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,509
centralized platform that require you to
pass kyc

380
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:23,519
pass kyc
 

381
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,350
pass kyc
and story of funds in in the custody

382
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
and story of funds in in the custody
 

383
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,910
and story of funds in in the custody
so it's a custodial way but nexo

384
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
so it's a custodial way but nexo
 

385
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,230
so it's a custodial way but nexo
actually played a very very good

386
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
actually played a very very good
 

387
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,750
actually played a very very good
role in the market and showed how

388
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
role in the market and showed how
 

389
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,230
role in the market and showed how
it can be done differently from the

390
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
it can be done differently from the
 

391
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,310
it can be done differently from the
traditional banking

392
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
traditional banking
 

393
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,870
traditional banking
and it's a big big thanks to them uh

394
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
and it's a big big thanks to them uh
 

395
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,670
and it's a big big thanks to them uh
because they were

396
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:43,680
because they were
 

397
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,389
because they were
pioneers of this area uh the next one to

398
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:46,399
pioneers of this area uh the next one to
 

399
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,670
pioneers of this area uh the next one to
mention is a block fee

400
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
mention is a block fee
 

401
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,670
mention is a block fee
that was hacked recently and you may

402
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
that was hacked recently and you may
 

403

have seen some news about this
so the hackers stole

406
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
so the hackers stole
 

407
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,269
so the hackers stole
stole some some millions of dollars from

was one of the

414
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
was one of the
 

415
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,389
was one of the
challengers for the fonexo and they were

416
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
challengers for the fonexo and they were
 

417
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,949
challengers for the fonexo and they were
delivering very good and sophisticated

418
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
delivering very good and sophisticated
 

419
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,590
delivering very good and sophisticated
products

420
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
products
 

421
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,949
products
uh was a very good ui uh i hope that

422
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
uh was a very good ui uh i hope that
 

423
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,990
uh was a very good ui uh i hope that
they will recover

424
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,000
they will recover
 

425
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,110
they will recover
and they will manage to to over overcome

426
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
and they will manage to to over overcome
 

427
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,350
and they will manage to to over overcome
this this crisis

428
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
this this crisis
 

429
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,710
this this crisis
uh uh the one also worth to mention in

430
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
uh uh the one also worth to mention in
 

431
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,829
uh uh the one also worth to mention in
the celsius network

432
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:21,839
the celsius network
 

433
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,030
the celsius network
uh they uh started actually the first

434
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
uh they uh started actually the first
 

435
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,110
uh they uh started actually the first
the first celsius model uh i remember

436
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
the first celsius model uh i remember
 

437
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,790
the first celsius model uh i remember
when i was talking to them

438
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
when i was talking to them
 

439
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,470
when i was talking to them
a couple of years ago when they were

440
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
a couple of years ago when they were
 

441
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,389
a couple of years ago when they were
just starting uh

442
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:32,399
just starting uh
 

443
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,190
just starting uh
they were already approaching the defy

444
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
they were already approaching the defy
 

445
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,990
they were already approaching the defy
approach so

446
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,000
approach so
 

447
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,710
approach so
kind of uh decentralized uh landing when

448
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:38,720
kind of uh decentralized uh landing when
 

449
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,110
kind of uh decentralized uh landing when
they're

450
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
they're
 

451
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,629
they're
or p2p landing actually uh

452
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
or p2p landing actually uh
 

453
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,990
or p2p landing actually uh
it it was a bit different different

454
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
it it was a bit different different
 

455
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,310
it it was a bit different different
pros and was used by nexo where an exo

456
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,320
pros and was used by nexo where an exo
 

457
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,350
pros and was used by nexo where an exo
pro position themselves like a central

458
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,360
pro position themselves like a central
 

459
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,710
pro position themselves like a central
counterparty where you

460
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
counterparty where you
 

461
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,069
counterparty where you
you put your funds for deposit

462
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
you put your funds for deposit
 

463
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,189
you put your funds for deposit
or take for credit

464
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:01,199
or take for credit
 

465
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,389
or take for credit
uh and but now celsius actually

466
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
uh and but now celsius actually
 

467
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,590
uh and but now celsius actually
evolved into yet another centralized

468
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
evolved into yet another centralized
 

469
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,829
evolved into yet another centralized
institution that you can use to to

borrow some funds
 

473
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,710
borrow some funds
uh of course this could not uh last

474
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,720
uh of course this could not uh last
 

475
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,069
uh of course this could not uh last
too long when you

476
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:20,079
too long when you
 

477
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,430
too long when you
when the defy started to evolve

478
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:23,440
when the defy started to evolve
 

479
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,629
when the defy started to evolve
in the defy

480
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:26,639
in the defy
 

481
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,670
in the defy
notion actually started to

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
notion actually started to

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:32,800
show up in news headlines
 

485
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,949
show up in news headlines
in 2019 and then we started to

in 2019 and then we started to
 

487
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,550
in 2019 and then we started to

of course crypto traders so who really
 

561
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:19,509
of course crypto traders so who really
uh

562
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
uh
 

563
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,189
uh
were seeking for some leverage

564
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
were seeking for some leverage

when there is a high gross

568
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
when there is a high gross
 

569
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,269
when there is a high gross
opportunity and they

570
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:33,279
opportunity and they
 

571
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,389
opportunity and they
didn't want to sell the uh main assets

572
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:36,399
didn't want to sell the uh main assets
 

573
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:36,870
didn't want to sell the uh main assets
so they

574
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
so they
 

575
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,310
so they
could easily stake it on our and

00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:47,279
uh yeah actually
 

583
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,430
uh yeah actually
this was three key value propositions by

584
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,440
this was three key value propositions by
 

585
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,310
this was three key value propositions by
other and

586
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,320
other and
 

587
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,430
other and
uh speaking of use cases uh

588
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
uh speaking of use cases uh
 

589
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,949
uh speaking of use cases uh
these were uh a bit bigger number of

590
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:56,959
these were uh a bit bigger number of
 

591
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:57,269
these were uh a bit bigger number of
them

592
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:57,279
them
 

593
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,310
them
so first of all uh users

594
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,320
so first of all uh users
 

595
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,630
so first of all uh users
uh were seen of like a savings account

596
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:04,640
uh were seen of like a savings account
 

597
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,069
uh were seen of like a savings account
which uh

598
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,079

 

599
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,870

which was allowing you actually not to

600
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880
which was allowing you actually not to
 

601
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,909
which was allowing you actually not to

602
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:11,919
uh
 

603
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,309
uh
to make your funds work and get some

604
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:14,319
to make your funds work and get some
 

605
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,189
to make your funds work and get some
interest on top of

606
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
interest on top of
 

607
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,350
interest on top of
it and users were depositing funds

608
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,360
it and users were depositing funds
 

609
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,429
it and users were depositing funds
in in the smart contracts and the assets

610
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
in in the smart contracts and the assets
 

611
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,270
in in the smart contracts and the assets
were available to borrowers

612
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
were available to borrowers
 

613
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,350
were available to borrowers
and uh albert

614
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,360
and uh albert
 

615
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,990
and uh albert
designed the smart contract in such a

616
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
designed the smart contract in such a
 

617
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,870
designed the smart contract in such a
way that

618
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:30,880
way that
 

619
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,870
way that
deposits are always greater than the

620
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,880
deposits are always greater than the
 

621
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,070
deposits are always greater than the
total borrow so

622
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
total borrow so
 

623
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,430
total borrow so
actually uh there is

624
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:39,440

 

625
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,230

almost almost of course there is always

626
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
almost almost of course there is always
 

627
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,430
almost almost of course there is always
an opportunity but

628
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
an opportunity but
 

629
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,549
an opportunity but
in the real world users

630
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:46,559
in the real world users
 

631
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,789
in the real world users
will be able to withdraw their funds

632
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
will be able to withdraw their funds
 

633
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,390
will be able to withdraw their funds
normally except for the situation of

634
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400
normally except for the situation of
 

635
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,350
normally except for the situation of
bankrupt

636
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
bankrupt
 

637
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,270
bankrupt
so it's pretty much like traditional

638
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280
so it's pretty much like traditional
 

639
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,390
so it's pretty much like traditional
banks work as well

640
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:54,400
banks work as well
 

641
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,430
banks work as well
so they offer a bit higher rate on the

642
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
so they offer a bit higher rate on the
 

643
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,310
so they offer a bit higher rate on the
credits and

644
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,320
credits and
 

645
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,710
credits and
a bit lower rate on the deposits and

646
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:00,720
a bit lower rate on the deposits and
 

647
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,750
a bit lower rate on the deposits and
normally uh

648
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:01,760
normally uh
 

649
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,270
normally uh
they should keep the resource that will

00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
they should keep the resource that will
 

651
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,430
they should keep the resource that will
allow to sustain a normal withdrawals

652
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,440
allow to sustain a normal withdrawals
 

653
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,310
allow to sustain a normal withdrawals
operation

next this case it was a traditional loan

658
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,400
next this case it was a traditional loan

uh
so when crypto users who are in the need

662
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
so when crypto users who are in the need
 

663
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,190

currently uh if you have a look on
 

689
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,710
currently uh if you have a look on
what uh lending protocols offer so the

690
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:50,720
what uh lending protocols offer so the
 

691
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,430
what uh lending protocols offer so the
rates on loans are significantly better

rates on loans are significantly better
 

693
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,909
rates on loans are significantly better
than the centralized counterparts

694
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:55,919
than the centralized counterparts
 

695
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,870
than the centralized counterparts
just just for instance if you try to

696
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:58,880
just just for instance if you try to
 

697
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,549
just just for instance if you try to
take

698
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:00,559
take
 

699
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,830
take
a usdc loan from block fee

700
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
a usdc loan from block fee
 

701
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,630
a usdc loan from block fee
it will offer it to you with the apr of

00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
roughly 16 and uh if you take it from
 

707
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,630
roughly 16 and uh if you take it from
others so it will uh

708
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:12,640
others so it will uh
 

709
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,190
others so it will uh
be something like under five percent

710
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
be something like under five percent
 

711
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,029
be something like under five percent
which which is a significant difference

712
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:17,039
which which is a significant difference
 

713
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:17,990
which which is a significant difference
when you consider

714
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
when you consider
 

715
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,270
when you consider
uh even all the transactional costs that

716
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
uh even all the transactional costs that
 

717
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,990
uh even all the transactional costs that
may occur when you're interacting with

decentralized application
 

721
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,310
decentralized application
of course there is

722
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,320
of course there is
 

723
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,230
of course there is
a specific use case that is more

724
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,240
a specific use case that is more
 

725
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,750
a specific use case that is more
suitable for western countries

726
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:33,760
suitable for western countries
 

727
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,950
suitable for western countries
which is called tax advantages when

728
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:36,960
which is called tax advantages when
 

729
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,310
which is called tax advantages when
you need some liquidity and you don't

730
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
you need some liquidity and you don't
 

731
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,430
you need some liquidity and you don't
have to sell

732
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440
have to sell
 

733
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,789
have to sell
actually your your basic asset because

734
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:44,799
actually your your basic asset because
 

735
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,870
actually your your basic asset because
in case you sell it uh you have to

736
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:46,880
in case you sell it uh you have to
 

737
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,789
in case you sell it uh you have to
report to tax inspection

738
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799
report to tax inspection
 

739
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,990
report to tax inspection
on the income earned and pay

740
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
on the income earned and pay
 

741
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,390
on the income earned and pay
some taxes uh so in this case when you

742
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,400
some taxes uh so in this case when you
 

743
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,110
some taxes uh so in this case when you
just

744
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,120
just
 

745
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,830
just
uh stake it and take some additional

746
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
uh stake it and take some additional
 

747
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,390
uh stake it and take some additional
money

748
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,400
money
 

749
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,590
money
uh as as a loan so you don't have to

750
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,600
uh as as a loan so you don't have to
 

751
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,110
uh as as a loan so you don't have to
to pay this tax it it

752
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,120
to pay this tax it it
 

753
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,149
to pay this tax it it
makes may sound not really important

754
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:08,159
makes may sound not really important
 

755
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,149
makes may sound not really important
for for most of countries but if you

756
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:10,159
for for most of countries but if you
 

757
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,830
for for most of countries but if you
speak about

758
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:11,840
speak about
 

759
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,029
speak about
citizens of usa or some european

760
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:15,039
citizens of usa or some european
 

761
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,789
citizens of usa or some european
countries like germany or france

762
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
countries like germany or france
 

763
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,470
countries like germany or france
so it is a significant benefit for them

764
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,480

 

765
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,830

flash loans of course this is a unique

766
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:25,840
flash loans of course this is a unique
 

767
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,590
flash loans of course this is a unique
feature that was initially offered by

768
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,600
feature that was initially offered by
 

769
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,870
feature that was initially offered by
other that

770
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:30,880
other that
 

771
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,029
other that
allowed smart contracts to borrow from

772
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:33,039
allowed smart contracts to borrow from
 

773
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,710
allowed smart contracts to borrow from
the protocol

774

without collateral and the only
 

777
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,710
without collateral and the only
requirement was

778
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:38,720
requirement was
 

779
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,230
requirement was
that they should pay the loan back

780
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,240
that they should pay the loan back
 

781
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,909
that they should pay the loan back
within the same transaction block and

782
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:43,919
within the same transaction block and
 

783
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,310
within the same transaction block and
thanks to

784
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,320
thanks to
 

785
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,710
thanks to
the ethereum design which releases

786
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
the ethereum design which releases
 

787
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,750

blocks
 

789
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,909
blocks
uh well roughly roughly in 10 minutes

790
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:53,919
uh well roughly roughly in 10 minutes
 

791
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,270
uh well roughly roughly in 10 minutes
if i'm drunk so uh it's well enough time

792
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,280
if i'm drunk so uh it's well enough time
 

793
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,110
if i'm drunk so uh it's well enough time
to perform your operations

794

to perform your operations
 

795
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,149
to perform your operations
and actually the flash loans were

796
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:04,159
and actually the flash loans were
 

797
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,110
and actually the flash loans were
offered up to 25 000

798
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,120
offered up to 25 000
 

799

801
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,149

yeah maybe now they say even higher

802
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:16,159
yeah maybe now they say even higher
 

803
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,909
yeah maybe now they say even higher
there is a lot a lot of information

804
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:17,919
there is a lot a lot of information
 

805
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,350
there is a lot a lot of information
about flash loans and

806
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,360
about flash loans and
 

807
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,350
about flash loans and
i remember that some of you already were

808
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
i remember that some of you already were
 

809
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,270
i remember that some of you already were
asking about the the possibility to

810
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,280
asking about the the possibility to
 

811
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,830
asking about the the possibility to
implement flash loans

812
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:25,840
implement flash loans
 

813
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,830
implement flash loans
on free tone but unfortunately we cannot

814
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:27,840
on free tone but unfortunately we cannot
 

815
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,750
on free tone but unfortunately we cannot
enjoy this because

816
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:29,760
enjoy this because
 

817
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,590
enjoy this because
on friton blocks appear significantly

818
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:33,600
on friton blocks appear significantly
 

819
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,149
on friton blocks appear significantly
far faster than one ethereum

820
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:38,159

 

821
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,270

the next the next

822
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:41,280
the next the next
 

823
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,549
the next the next
proposal is for smart contract wallets

824
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:44,559
proposal is for smart contract wallets
 

825
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,870
proposal is for smart contract wallets
where the app developers who were

826
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:46,880
where the app developers who were
 

827
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,549
where the app developers who were
responsible for creating smart contract

828
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
responsible for creating smart contract
 

829
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,830
responsible for creating smart contract
wallets

830
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:49,840
wallets
 

831
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,990
wallets
could also offer some lending services

832
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,000
could also offer some lending services
 

833
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,110
could also offer some lending services
to the users

834
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,120
to the users
 

835
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,750
to the users
and such wallets were aggregating the

836
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:55,760
and such wallets were aggregating the
 

837
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,750
and such wallets were aggregating the
best rates from

838
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:57,760
best rates from
 

839
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,909
best rates from
all known and audited lending protocols

840
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:01,919
all known and audited lending protocols
 

841
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,430
all known and audited lending protocols
and users could easily select where they

842
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:05,440
and users could easily select where they
 

843
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,310
and users could easily select where they
better deposit the the funds or withdraw

844
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,320
better deposit the the funds or withdraw
 

845
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,710
better deposit the the funds or withdraw
the funds

846
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:10,720
the funds
 

847
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,950
the funds
margin trading of course uh i will not

848
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:12,960
margin trading of course uh i will not
 

849
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,750
margin trading of course uh i will not
just uh

850
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:13,760
just uh
 

851
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,029
just uh
just just name it so everyone

852
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:15,039
just just name it so everyone
 

853
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,950
just just name it so everyone
understands what this is and

854
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:16,960
understands what this is and
 

855
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,750
understands what this is and
uh there are some two specific cases

856
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:19,760
uh there are some two specific cases
 

857
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,310
uh there are some two specific cases
also

858
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:20,320
also
 

859
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,149
also
that appeared with uh some decentralized

860
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:24,159
that appeared with uh some decentralized
 

861
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,789
that appeared with uh some decentralized
learning protocols of the first one is

862
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:26,799
learning protocols of the first one is
 

863
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,470
learning protocols of the first one is
the concept of yield bots

864
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:28,480
the concept of yield bots
 

865
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,710
the concept of yield bots
um so this is a decentralized uh

866
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:32,720
um so this is a decentralized uh
 

867
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,470
um so this is a decentralized uh
way of finding the better better

868
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:36,480
way of finding the better better
 

869
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,190
way of finding the better better
place so it's an automated money

870
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,200
place so it's an automated money
 

871
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,149
place so it's an automated money
management tool

872
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
management tool
 

873
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,190
management tool
so it what it actually does it scans the

874
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
so it what it actually does it scans the
 

875
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,270
so it what it actually does it scans the
best offering from the market

876
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,280
best offering from the market
 

877
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,990
best offering from the market
compares and automatically moves your

878
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,000
compares and automatically moves your
 

879
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,630
compares and automatically moves your
liquidity from one protocol to another

880
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:50,640
liquidity from one protocol to another
 

881
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,870
liquidity from one protocol to another
so uh it's it's a very good idea and i

882
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:52,880
so uh it's it's a very good idea and i
 

883
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,390
so uh it's it's a very good idea and i
hope that such

884
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,400
hope that such
 

885
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,470
hope that such
thing will one day appear on the

886
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:56,480
thing will one day appear on the
 

887
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,230
thing will one day appear on the
fritonica system because

888
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,240
fritonica system because
 

889
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,270
fritonica system because
uh it actually shows that there is

890
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:01,280
uh it actually shows that there is
 

891
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,350
uh it actually shows that there is
tremendous amount of liquidity and a

892
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,360
tremendous amount of liquidity and a
 

893
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,789
tremendous amount of liquidity and a
very big

894
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:04,799
very big
 

895
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,149
very big
number of successful market players

896
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:08,159
number of successful market players
 

897
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,149
number of successful market players
that can compete with each other and

898
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:10,159
that can compete with each other and
 

899
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,070
that can compete with each other and
this competition is always good for

900
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,080
this competition is always good for
 

901
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,029
this competition is always good for
for the whole platform and another

902
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:15,039
for the whole platform and another
 

903
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:15,750
for the whole platform and another
concept is

904
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:15,760
concept is
 

905
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,470
concept is
liquidators so we also uh touch this

906
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:18,480
liquidators so we also uh touch this
 

907
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,789
liquidators so we also uh touch this
concept a few times if i

908
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:20,799
concept a few times if i
 

909
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,070
concept a few times if i
if i'm not wrong

910
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,080

 

911
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,350

this is the way how uh

912
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,360
this is the way how uh
 

913
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,549
this is the way how uh
leading protocols deal with

914
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:30,559
leading protocols deal with
 

915
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,830
leading protocols deal with
margin calls when someone

916
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:33,840
margin calls when someone
 

917
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,590
margin calls when someone
doesn't return the loan on time

918
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:37,600
doesn't return the loan on time
 

919
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,630
doesn't return the loan on time
so actually uh it's as simple as selling

920
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:40,640
so actually uh it's as simple as selling
 

921
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,430
so actually uh it's as simple as selling
as

922
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:41,440
as
 

923
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,990
as
a basic asset as a discount rate to the

924
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,000
a basic asset as a discount rate to the
 

925
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,789
a basic asset as a discount rate to the
market

926
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:44,799
market
 

927
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,190
market
and those

928
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200

 

929
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,190

players those users who are called

930
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,200
players those users who are called
 

931
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,230
players those users who are called
liquidators

932
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,240
liquidators
 

933
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,669
liquidators
so they uh compete with each other for

934
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:55,679
so they uh compete with each other for
 

935
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,830
so they uh compete with each other for
liquidating this position because if you

936
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:57,840
liquidating this position because if you
 

937
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,789
liquidating this position because if you
get uh

938
00:23:58,789 --> 00:23:58,799
get uh
 

939
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,789
get uh
an instant exposure five percent to the

940
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
an instant exposure five percent to the
 

941
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,230
an instant exposure five percent to the
market you can

942
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,240
market you can
 

943
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,350
market you can
later uh using your arbitrary

944
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,360
later uh using your arbitrary
 

945
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,230
later uh using your arbitrary
strategy so it's very good and this

946
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,240
strategy so it's very good and this
 

947
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,750
strategy so it's very good and this
liquidation

948
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760
liquidation
 

949
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,590
liquidation
institute so uh is very good

950
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:13,600
institute so uh is very good
 

951
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,830
institute so uh is very good
for all the lending and i think that it

952
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:15,840
for all the lending and i think that it
 

953
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,350
for all the lending and i think that it
will definitely appear

954
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,360
will definitely appear
 

955
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:23,590
will definitely appear
in native return protocols as well

956
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600

 

957
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,029

speaking about tokenomics

958
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:27,039
speaking about tokenomics
 

959
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,710
speaking about tokenomics
and yeah just to mention that i'm now

960
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:30,720
and yeah just to mention that i'm now
 

961
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,870
and yeah just to mention that i'm now
telling all this on the basis of other

962
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:32,880
telling all this on the basis of other
 

963
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,190
telling all this on the basis of other
because it's one of the most advanced uh

964
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,200
because it's one of the most advanced uh
 

965
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,190
because it's one of the most advanced uh
platforms that is dominating over the

966
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
platforms that is dominating over the
 

967
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,870
platforms that is dominating over the
market like bitcoin

968
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:38,880
market like bitcoin
 

969
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,909
market like bitcoin
on all the uh crypto markets but

970
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919
on all the uh crypto markets but
 

971
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,710
on all the uh crypto markets but
uh all other protocols work pretty much

972
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:44,720
uh all other protocols work pretty much
 

973
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,350
uh all other protocols work pretty much
the same

974
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:45,360
the same
 

975
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,149
the same
so they differ in some peculiar details

976
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:48,159
so they differ in some peculiar details
 

977
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:48,470
so they differ in some peculiar details
and

978
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:48,480
and
 

979
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,669
and
uh but uh generally speaking they are

980
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:51,679
uh but uh generally speaking they are
 

981
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,510
uh but uh generally speaking they are
all very similar so uh about economics

982
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:55,520
all very similar so uh about economics
 

983
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,549
all very similar so uh about economics
uh actually all other loans they

984
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:58,559
uh actually all other loans they
 

985
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,470
uh actually all other loans they
have some uh 0.01

986
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:02,480
have some uh 0.01
 

987
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,230
have some uh 0.01

push the price of this this government's
 

997
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,950

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,990
talking up
which which is quite a smart way uh and

1000
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,000
which which is quite a smart way uh and

of these uh this origination fee

1004
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,000
of these uh this origination fee
 

1005
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,950
of these uh this origination fee
uh goes to the referral program uh in

1006
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:30,960
uh goes to the referral program uh in
 

1007
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,510
uh goes to the referral program uh in
its own

1008

its own
 

1009
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,390
its own
uh referral fees uh so they're splitted

1010
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:34,400
uh referral fees uh so they're splitted
 

1011
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,029
uh referral fees uh so they're splitted
between

1012
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:35,039
between
 

1013
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,909
between
lenders and borrowers uh like 40 to 260

lenders and borrowers uh like 40 to 260
 

1015

lenders and borrowers uh like 40 to 260
and they are paid to the protocols

1016
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:43,679
and they are paid to the protocols
 

1017
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,230
and they are paid to the protocols
that have integrated uh

1018
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:48,240

 

1019
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,430

other for the users and
users of these protocols can

1022
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:54,960
users of these protocols can
 

1023
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,630
users of these protocols can
stake or borrow money and the protocol

00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
stake or borrow money and the protocol
 

1025
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,269
stake or borrow money and the protocol
itself

1026
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,279
itself
 

1027
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,590
itself
gets rewarded then we have

1028
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:03,600
gets rewarded then we have
 

1029
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,789
gets rewarded then we have
so-called a tokens it's after

1030
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:06,799
so-called a tokens it's after
 

1031
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,110
so-called a tokens it's after
other in compound for instance you have

1032
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,120
other in compound for instance you have
 

1033
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,310
other in compound for instance you have
c tokens soft

1034
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,320
c tokens soft
 

1035
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,669
c tokens soft
after compound uh so these are special

1036
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:13,679
after compound uh so these are special
 

1037
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,190
after compound uh so these are special
tokens that are issued against

00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:15,200
tokens that are issued against
 

1039
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,230
tokens that are issued against
your staked liquidity

1040
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240
your staked liquidity
 

1041
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,269
your staked liquidity
and this works pretty similar to

1042
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:21,279
and this works pretty similar to
 

1043
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,149
and this works pretty similar to
robton that we are using uh in our

uh because sometimes uh

1048
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:28,400
uh because sometimes uh
 

1049
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,909
uh because sometimes uh
it is easier for you to have a uniform

1050
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:31,919
it is easier for you to have a uniform
 

1051
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,750
it is easier for you to have a uniform
tokens that you can build

1052
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:35,760
tokens that you can build
 

1053
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,029
tokens that you can build
smart contract logic about

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,950
course uh ratio
and uh you get rewarded in these

1060
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:46,960
and uh you get rewarded in these
 

1061
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,190
and uh you get rewarded in these
tokens actually when you for example

1062
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:49,200
tokens actually when you for example
 

1063
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,149

also our plans now to introduce some

1068
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,200
also our plans now to introduce some
 

1069
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,310
also our plans now to introduce some
economics updates

1070
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320
economics updates
 

1071
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,230
economics updates
and uh so we uh we're all waiting for

1072
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,240
and uh so we uh we're all waiting for
 

1073
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,470
and uh so we uh we're all waiting for
what it will be because uh like we

1074
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:04,480
what it will be because uh like we
 

1075
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,789
what it will be because uh like we
learned from uni swap examples so

1076
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:06,799
learned from uni swap examples so
 

1077
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,470
learned from uni swap examples so
the third version uh differs

1078
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:08,480
the third version uh differs
 

1079
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,630
the third version uh differs
significantly from the second one

1080
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:10,640
significantly from the second one
 

1081
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,510
significantly from the second one
and maybe maybe other will propose

1082
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:13,520
and maybe maybe other will propose
 

1083
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,230
and maybe maybe other will propose
something

1084
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,240
something
 

1085
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,950
something
something really new to the market uh

1086
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:18,960
something really new to the market uh
 

1087
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,590
something really new to the market uh

1106
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:41,840
motor 3.8 so
 

1107
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,110
motor 3.8 so
but the quantity of course does not

1108
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,120
but the quantity of course does not
 

1109

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,750
reflect the quality here
and we need to understand that other uh

1112
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:49,760
and we need to understand that other uh
 

1113
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,230
and we need to understand that other uh
do this because it can actually

do this because it can actually
 

1115
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,510
do this because it can actually
uh yeah so and if we uh

1116
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:57,520
uh yeah so and if we uh
 

1117
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,909
uh yeah so and if we uh
have a sneak peek on the default pulse

1118
00:27:59,909 --> 00:27:59,919
have a sneak peek on the default pulse
 

1119
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,070
have a sneak peek on the default pulse
and select the lending section so we can

1120
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,080
and select the lending section so we can
 

1121
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,710
and select the lending section so we can
see that

1122
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:02,720
see that
 

1123
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,750
see that
currently the lending market uh

1124
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:05,760
currently the lending market uh
 

1125
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,470
currently the lending market uh
has a total value locked of 33 billion

1131
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,710
where other dominates with 27

1132
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:16,720

but uh alfajomora and instadep
 

1147
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,350
but uh alfajomora and instadep
they are not uh independent uh in terms

00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:35,360
they are not uh independent uh in terms
 

1149
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,470
they are not uh independent uh in terms
of liquidity so

1150
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:36,480
of liquidity so
 

1151
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,510
of liquidity so
because instadep for example uh relies

1152
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:39,520
because instadep for example uh relies
 

1153
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,510
because instadep for example uh relies
on

1154
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:41,520
on
 

1155
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,350
on
a makering compound whereas alfa hamora

1156
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:45,360
a makering compound whereas alfa hamora
 

1157
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,909
a makering compound whereas alfa hamora
relies on guinea swap and sushi swamp so

1158
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:47,919
relies on guinea swap and sushi swamp so
 

1159
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,230
relies on guinea swap and sushi swamp so
and the liquidity is kind of mixed

1160
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,240

 

1161
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,070

and the total number is also not that

1162
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,080
and the total number is also not that
 

1163
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,750
and the total number is also not that
big so it's 27 of them on the divi pulse

1164
00:28:59,750 --> 00:28:59,760
big so it's 27 of them on the divi pulse
 

1165
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,909
big so it's 27 of them on the divi pulse
and most of them is uh under 30 million

1166
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:03,919
and most of them is uh under 30 million
 

1167
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,029
and most of them is uh under 30 million
value locked so you see that they cannot

1168
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:07,039
value locked so you see that they cannot
 

1169
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,070
value locked so you see that they cannot
compete

1170
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,080
compete
 

1171
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,070
compete
in that sense to the market leaders

1172
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,080
in that sense to the market leaders
 

1173
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,149
in that sense to the market leaders
yeah that's that's pretty it's about the

1174
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:14,159
yeah that's that's pretty it's about the
 

1175
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,909
yeah that's that's pretty it's about the
market overview uh

1176
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:15,919
market overview uh
 

1177
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,230
market overview uh
and what i want to discuss

1178
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,240
and what i want to discuss
 

1179
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,750
and what i want to discuss
is uh how do we approach the lending

1180
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:23,760
is uh how do we approach the lending
 

1181
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,269
is uh how do we approach the lending
uh in freetown so what should we start

1182
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:27,279
uh in freetown so what should we start
 

1183
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:27,909
uh in freetown so what should we start
from

1184
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:27,919
from
 

1185
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,029
from
and

1186
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:31,039

 

1187
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,190

which contest should we host for uh for

1188
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,200
which contest should we host for uh for
 

1189
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,470
which contest should we host for uh for
for the first

1190
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:34,480
for the first
 

1191
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,909
for the first
uh iteration so who wants to to start

1192
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:37,919
uh iteration so who wants to to start
 

1193
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:45,029
uh iteration so who wants to to start
these guys raisins

1194
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:45,039

 

1195
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:51,269

nobody really

1196
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:51,279

 

1197
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,070

all right maybe landing is not the most

1198
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,080
all right maybe landing is not the most
 

1199
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,909
all right maybe landing is not the most
interesting part for the defying

1200
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:55,919
interesting part for the defying
 

1201
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,830
interesting part for the defying
system of return

1202
00:29:59,830 --> 00:29:59,840

 

1203
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,549

no maybe we need to think about this

1204
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:04,559

 

1205
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,029

yeah uh maybe i should start actually

1206

1261
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,389

yes anzar please um yeah i think

1262
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:38,399
yes anzar please um yeah i think
 

1263
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,789
yes anzar please um yeah i think
that as soon as we get to to the point

1264
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:40,799
that as soon as we get to to the point
 

1265
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,070
that as soon as we get to to the point
where um

1266
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,080
where um
 

1267
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,110
where um
where d5 is more developed in the free

1268
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,120
where d5 is more developed in the free
 

1269
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,630
where d5 is more developed in the free
tone as soon as we get to

working taxes and uh well

1272
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:50,880
working taxes and uh well
 

1273
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,990
working taxes and uh well
working for some time bridges for for

1274
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,000
working for some time bridges for for
 

1275
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,029
working for some time bridges for for
some more time and

1276
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:55,039
some more time and
 

1277
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,110
some more time and
uh attract some more liquidity i think

1278
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,120
uh attract some more liquidity i think
 

1279
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,710
uh attract some more liquidity i think
we can we can

1280
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
we can we can
 

1281
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,669
we can we can
definitely start with with option one

1282
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:01,679
definitely start with with option one
 

1283
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:02,389
definitely start with with option one
because

1284
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:02,399
because
 

1285
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,070
because
that's practically what is happening

1286
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,080
that's practically what is happening
 

1287
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,230
that's practically what is happening
with some of the taxes

1288
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:06,240
with some of the taxes
 

1289
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,669
with some of the taxes
right now uh with uh

1290
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:09,679
right now uh with uh
 

1291
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,710
right now uh with uh
where we just take something that works

1292
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:12,720
where we just take something that works
 

1293
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,590
where we just take something that works
really well already and just sport it to

1294
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:15,600
really well already and just sport it to
 

1295
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,389
really well already and just sport it to
free ton

1296
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:16,399
free ton
 

1297
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,789
free ton
and use all the good stuff that is in

1298
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:18,799
and use all the good stuff that is in
 

1299
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,149
and use all the good stuff that is in
freetown

1300
00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:20,159
freetown
 

1301
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,590
freetown
but i think that maybe

1302
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:23,600
but i think that maybe
 

1303
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,230
but i think that maybe
yeah just now i i'm thinking that option

1304
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:26,240
yeah just now i i'm thinking that option
 

1305
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,070
yeah just now i i'm thinking that option
one is is actually a lot slower

1306
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,080
one is is actually a lot slower
 

1307
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,350
one is is actually a lot slower
than the option two okay the second one

1308
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:31,360
than the option two okay the second one
 

1309
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,230
than the option two okay the second one
you told about uh just agreeing with

1310
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:34,240
you told about uh just agreeing with
 

1311
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,549
you told about uh just agreeing with
this yes network cell on the partnership

1312
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:36,559
this yes network cell on the partnership
 

1313
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,830
this yes network cell on the partnership
supports the solution i think

1314
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:39,840
supports the solution i think
 

1315
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,549
supports the solution i think
the second option might be a lot faster

1316
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:42,559
the second option might be a lot faster
 

1317
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,350
the second option might be a lot faster
but

1318
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:43,360
but
 

1319
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,190
but
well it requires uh well someone who

1320
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:47,200
well it requires uh well someone who
 

1321
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,950
well it requires uh well someone who
negotiates that to to sell free tone as

1322
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:50,960
negotiates that to to sell free tone as
 

1323
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,230
negotiates that to to sell free tone as
the good solution for uh

1324
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:54,240
the good solution for uh
 

1325
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,350
the good solution for uh
for landing yeah so

1326
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:57,360
for landing yeah so
 

1327
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,470
for landing yeah so
i i won't really tell any new things

1328
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:00,480
i i won't really tell any new things
 

1329
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,789
i i won't really tell any new things
uh now because i didn't really have time

1330
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:02,799
uh now because i didn't really have time
 

1331
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,830
uh now because i didn't really have time
to to think

1332
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:03,840
to to think
 

1333
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,149
to to think
a lot about that but i think the second

1334
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:06,159
a lot about that but i think the second
 

1335
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,789
a lot about that but i think the second
so the second option is probably the

1336
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:08,799
so the second option is probably the
 

1337
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,190
so the second option is probably the
uh the one that can be started like

1338
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,200
uh the one that can be started like
 

1339
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,070
uh the one that can be started like
right now

1340
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,080
right now
 

1341
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,669
right now
i mean it's it's it doesn't require

1342
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:15,679
i mean it's it's it doesn't require
 

1343
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,070
i mean it's it's it doesn't require
to develop anything it just requires a

1344
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,080
to develop anything it just requires a
 

1345
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,350
to develop anything it just requires a
good sort of

1346
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:19,360
good sort of
 

1347
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,389
good sort of
like well it does require to to think

1348
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:22,399
like well it does require to to think
 

1349
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,269
like well it does require to to think
through the

1350
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:23,279
through the
 

1351
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,389
through the
the the the

1352
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:26,399
the the the
 

1353
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,710
the the the
the good things that the the potential

1354
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:28,720
the good things that the the potential
 

1355
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,630
the good things that the the potential
partner would get from that

1356
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:30,640
partner would get from that
 

1357
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,750
partner would get from that
and how the free tonic system is about

1358
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:33,760
and how the free tonic system is about
 

1359
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,070
and how the free tonic system is about
to

1360
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,080
to
 

1361
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,269
to
to to benefit from that i think that's

1362
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:37,279
to to benefit from that i think that's
 

1363
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,430
to to benefit from that i think that's
that's one of the uh that's the the

1364
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:39,440
that's one of the uh that's the the
 

1365
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,310
that's one of the uh that's the the
option that

1366
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,320
option that
 

1367
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,590
option that
can be chosen like

1368
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:43,600
can be chosen like
 

1369
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,909
can be chosen like
today tomorrow or something like that

1370
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:45,919
today tomorrow or something like that
 

1371
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,430
today tomorrow or something like that
yeah

1372
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:47,440
yeah
 

1373
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,710
yeah

1379
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,070

uh we have a lot of plans for future but

1380
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,080
uh we have a lot of plans for future but
 

1381
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,789
uh we have a lot of plans for future but
yeah let's

1382
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:00,799
yeah let's
 

1383
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,070
yeah let's
uh yeah well i think in the in due time

1384
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,080
uh yeah well i think in the in due time
 

1385
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:12,149
uh yeah well i think in the in due time
we'll

1386
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:12,159

 

1387
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,909

yeah but actually it's it's it's an

1388
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:13,919
yeah but actually it's it's it's an
 

1389
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:16,470
yeah but actually it's it's it's an
obvious uh idea that

1390
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:16,480
obvious uh idea that
 

1391
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,669
obvious uh idea that
lays just just on the ground because

1392
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:19,679
lays just just on the ground because
 

1393
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,790
lays just just on the ground because

protocols are really
 

1427
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,710
protocols are really
tightly entangled so if you uh have a

tightly entangled so if you uh have a

uh rely on exchanges again to

and uh it appeared
 

1453
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,109
and uh it appeared
not not for without not without reason

actually and uh of course it's always
 

1457
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,190
actually and uh of course it's always
worth to rely on some

1458
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:39,200
worth to rely on some
 

1459
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,470
worth to rely on some
um some good solutions instead of

1460
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:42,480
um some good solutions instead of
 

1461
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,430
um some good solutions instead of
creating your own one once and you

1462
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:45,440
creating your own one once and you
 

1463
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:45,990

that will enhance your user experience
 

1473
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,630
that will enhance your user experience
uh and i think that this question

1474
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:58,640
uh and i think that this question
 

1475
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,270
uh and i think that this question
uh will soon later appear in fritonica

1476
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:01,280
uh will soon later appear in fritonica
 

1477
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,630
uh will soon later appear in fritonica
system as well

system as well
 

1479
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,670
system as well
uh because right now we see that we

1480
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:05,680
uh because right now we see that we
 

1481
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,870
uh because right now we see that we
are kind of uh like wild wild west

1482
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:08,880
are kind of uh like wild wild west

we see which one will emerge faster and
 

1489
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,069
we see which one will emerge faster and
dominate the market but later

yeah sure about the margin trading i
 

1521
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,230
yeah sure about the margin trading i
think

1522

think
 

1523
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,550
think
we we probably what i'm thinking of now

we we probably what i'm thinking of now
 

1525
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,150
we we probably what i'm thinking of now
is sort of like a roadmap roadmap for

is sort of like a roadmap roadmap for
 

1527
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,510
is sort of like a roadmap roadmap for
d5 that is more global that like

okay in in like two months we have uh
 

1533
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,990
okay in in like two months we have uh
we'll have a bridge and a few taxes and

there's definitely a few solutions out
 

1541
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,069
there's definitely a few solutions out
there

1542
00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:36,079
there
 

1543
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,230
there
i didn't test them all but i think

1544
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:38,240
i didn't test them all but i think
 

1545
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,109
i didn't test them all but i think
there's

1546
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:39,119
there's
 

1547
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,430
there's
definitely going to be something working

1548
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:41,440
definitely going to be something working
 

1549
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,630
definitely going to be something working
like this summer

1550
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:42,640
like this summer
 

1551
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,750
like this summer
and having new users

1552
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:45,760
and having new users
 

1553
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,870
and having new users
so like well

1554
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:48,880
so like well
 

1555
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,430
so like well
nft is a different branch but still it's

1556
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:51,440
nft is a different branch but still it's
 

1557
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,550
nft is a different branch but still it's
very

1558
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:52,560
very
 

1559
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,030
very
it might be closely related to the taxes

1560
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,040
it might be closely related to the taxes
 

1561
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,310
it might be closely related to the taxes
and to

1562
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:56,320
and to
 

1563
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,670
and to
well movement of liquidity so

1564
00:37:59,670 --> 00:37:59,680
well movement of liquidity so
 

1565
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,390
well movement of liquidity so
yeah back to the roadmap i think maybe

1566
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,400
yeah back to the roadmap i think maybe
 

1567
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,670
yeah back to the roadmap i think maybe
we should

1568
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:03,680
we should
 

1569
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,030
we should
like have have it in advance to sort of

1570
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,040
like have have it in advance to sort of
 

1571
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,030
like have have it in advance to sort of
plan and see uh when

1572
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,040
plan and see uh when
 

1573
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,550
plan and see uh when
when those contests should be designed

1574
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:14,560
when those contests should be designed
 

1575
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,069
when those contests should be designed
uh so that we when the when those little

1576
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:18,079
uh so that we when the when those little
 

1577
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:18,630
uh so that we when the when those little
bricks

1578
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:18,640
bricks
 

1579
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,069
bricks
or parts are ready we get right to that

1580
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:22,079
or parts are ready we get right to that
 

1581
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,589
or parts are ready we get right to that
and start start building uh new stuff

1582
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:25,599
and start start building uh new stuff
 

1583
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,390
and start start building uh new stuff
and start well advertising outside of

1584
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:28,400
and start well advertising outside of
 

1585
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:28,870
and start well advertising outside of
the

1586
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:28,880
the
 

1587
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,470
the
free tone because again i think that

1588
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:32,480
free tone because again i think that
 

1589
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,829
free tone because again i think that
we would have like two or three times

1590
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:35,839
we would have like two or three times
 

1591
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,109
we would have like two or three times
as many solutions and contestants for

1592
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:39,119
as many solutions and contestants for
 

1593
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:39,589
as many solutions and contestants for
the

1594
00:38:39,589 --> 00:38:39,599
the
 

1595
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,950
the
contests and more well

1596
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:42,960
contests and more well
 

1597
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,390
contests and more well
more and better products uh if we

1598
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:46,400
more and better products uh if we
 

1599
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,230
more and better products uh if we
if we made the world if we if we

1600
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:50,240
if we made the world if we if we
 

1601
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,630
if we made the world if we if we
told the world about how cool our

1602
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:52,640
told the world about how cool our
 

1603
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,589
told the world about how cool our
contests are

1604
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:53,599
contests are
 

1605
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,990
contests are
and how how easy it is to you to get

1606
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,000
and how how easy it is to you to get
 

1607
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,190
and how how easy it is to you to get
into them and to

1608
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,200
into them and to
 

1609
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,030
into them and to
to make some great products and to start

1610
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,040
to make some great products and to start
 

1611
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,510
to make some great products and to start
stuff and to to win prizes

1612
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:01,520
stuff and to to win prizes
 

1613
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,870
stuff and to to win prizes
so uh i'm i'm not sure maybe there is

1614
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:04,880
so uh i'm i'm not sure maybe there is
 

1615
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,390
so uh i'm i'm not sure maybe there is
such a road map

1616
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:06,400
such a road map
 

1617
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,430
such a road map
maybe i'm actually uh i

1618
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:09,440
maybe i'm actually uh i
 

1619
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,270
maybe i'm actually uh i
remember that we have only one roadmap

1620
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:11,280
remember that we have only one roadmap
 

1621
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,630
remember that we have only one roadmap
that was initially created

1622
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:12,640
that was initially created
 

1623
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,950
that was initially created
at the moment of setting the device up

1624
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:14,960
at the moment of setting the device up
 

1625
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,510
at the moment of setting the device up
garbage

1626
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:17,520

 

1627
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,790

and i agree that maybe it is

1628
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:20,800
and i agree that maybe it is
 

1629
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,710
and i agree that maybe it is
the right moment in time when we should

1630
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:22,720
the right moment in time when we should
 

1631
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,550
the right moment in time when we should
update it actually

1632
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:24,560
update it actually
 

1633
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,069
update it actually
and we could even run a small

1634
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:28,079
and we could even run a small
 

1635
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,430
and we could even run a small
contest with some some small prizes

1636
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:31,440
contest with some some small prizes
 

1637
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,390
contest with some some small prizes
for for those who could take the lead on

1638
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:34,400
for for those who could take the lead on
 

1639
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,870
for for those who could take the lead on
that

1640
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:34,880
that
 

1641
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,470
that
and create a well-done road map

1642
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:38,480
and create a well-done road map
 

1643
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,710
and create a well-done road map
taking into account current market

1644
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:40,720
taking into account current market
 

1645
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,710
taking into account current market
trends and the grounding

1646
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:42,720
trends and the grounding
 

1647
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,750
trends and the grounding
why this or that

1648
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:45,760
why this or that
 

1649
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,589
why this or that
movement should be done on this topic on

1650
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:49,599
movement should be done on this topic on
 

1651
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,510
movement should be done on this topic on
the next one

1652
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:51,520
the next one
 

1653
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,990
the next one
yeah why not

1654
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:56,000
yeah why not
 

1655
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,230
yeah why not
yeah i think if if we make a contest we

1656
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:58,240
yeah i think if if we make a contest we
 

1657
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,310
yeah i think if if we make a contest we
should maybe think of some way to

1658
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:00,320
should maybe think of some way to
 

1659
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,270
should maybe think of some way to
uh to make it uh to make the product of

1660
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:03,280
uh to make it uh to make the product of
 

1661
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,069
uh to make it uh to make the product of
that contest

1662
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:04,079
that contest
 

1663
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,430
that contest
last so that we don't have

1664
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:07,440
last so that we don't have
 

1665
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,069
last so that we don't have
a an outdated roadmap in a few months

1666
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:10,079
a an outdated roadmap in a few months
 

1667
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:10,550
a an outdated roadmap in a few months
again

1668
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:10,560
again
 

1669
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,550
again
yes i mean yes like to to make it

1670
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:14,560
yes i mean yes like to to make it
 

1671
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,910
yes i mean yes like to to make it
like maybe a vested reward that

1672
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:17,920
like maybe a vested reward that
 

1673
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,910
like maybe a vested reward that
uh for updating yeah yeah yeah so

1674
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:21,920
uh for updating yeah yeah yeah so
 

1675
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,950
uh for updating yeah yeah yeah so
so there's like i don't know a committee

1676
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:24,960
so there's like i don't know a committee
 

1677
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,390
so there's like i don't know a committee
for that roadmap or

1678
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:26,400
for that roadmap or
 

1679
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,670
for that roadmap or
or a few or like a team that is uh

1680
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:29,680
or a few or like a team that is uh
 

1681
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,790
or a few or like a team that is uh
responsible for updating it and uh

1682
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:32,800
responsible for updating it and uh
 

1683
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,670
responsible for updating it and uh
well maybe with an analytics of

1684
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:35,680
well maybe with an analytics of
 

1685
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,190
well maybe with an analytics of
governments uh or some other one

1686
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,200
governments uh or some other one
 

1687
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,870
governments uh or some other one
uh to sort of analyze the current trends

1688
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:42,880
uh to sort of analyze the current trends
 

1689
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,910
uh to sort of analyze the current trends
in the uh in a some in some

1690
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:45,920
in the uh in a some in some
 

1691
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,390
in the uh in a some in some
sophisticated fashion so that

1692
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:48,400
sophisticated fashion so that
 

1693
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,670
sophisticated fashion so that
for sure that this is the best that

1694
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:51,680
for sure that this is the best that
 

1695
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,829
for sure that this is the best that
well this is like the the

1696
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:55,839
well this is like the the
 

1697
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,829
well this is like the the
this is like the best data that we can

1698
00:40:57,829 --> 00:40:57,839
this is like the best data that we can
 

1699
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,589
this is like the best data that we can
present to the freedom community

1700
00:40:59,589 --> 00:40:59,599
present to the freedom community
 

1701
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,309
present to the freedom community
yes yes we understand where where we

1702
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:02,319
yes yes we understand where where we
 

1703
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,270
yes yes we understand where where we
should move

1704
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:03,280
should move
 

1705
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,390
should move
and to understand where uh

1706
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:06,400
and to understand where uh
 

1707
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,030
and to understand where uh

maybe move from ethereum or to people
 

1729
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,510
maybe move from ethereum or to people
from

1730
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:35,520
from
 

1731
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,550
from
who are looking for new d5 systems yeah

1732
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:38,560
who are looking for new d5 systems yeah
 

1733
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,870
who are looking for new d5 systems yeah
and

1734
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:40,880

 

1735
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,109

yeah i agree uh maybe it should be

1736
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:43,119
yeah i agree uh maybe it should be
 

1737
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,870
yeah i agree uh maybe it should be
divided into two parts actually the

1738
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:44,880
divided into two parts actually the
 

1739
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,030
divided into two parts actually the
first one is analysis of the current

1740
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:47,040
first one is analysis of the current
 

1741
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,150
first one is analysis of the current
defined trends

1742
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:48,160
defined trends
 

1743
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,510
defined trends
and some arising trends because uh

00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:51,520
and some arising trends because uh
 

1745
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,750
and some arising trends because uh
what i learned from from that conference

1746
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:53,760
what i learned from from that conference
 

1747
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,270
what i learned from from that conference
from definition is that

1748
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,280
from definition is that
 

1749
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,910
from definition is that
actually there are some protocols that

1750
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:57,920
actually there are some protocols that
 

1751
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,829
actually there are some protocols that
do not did not release yet

1752
00:41:59,829 --> 00:41:59,839
do not did not release yet
 

1753
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,150
do not did not release yet
actually and they may have some

1754
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:02,160
actually and they may have some
 

1755
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,069
actually and they may have some
interesting proposals for the market and

1756
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:04,079
interesting proposals for the market and
 

1757
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,710
interesting proposals for the market and
that are solving certain uh certain

1758
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:06,720
that are solving certain uh certain
 

1759
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,670
that are solving certain uh certain
pains

1760
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:07,680
pains
 

1761
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,109
pains
and uh another in uh based on this

1762
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:11,119
and uh another in uh based on this
 

1763
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:11,910
and uh another in uh based on this
analysis

1764
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:11,920
analysis
 

1765
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,430
analysis
so uh we can uh create

1766
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:15,440
so uh we can uh create
 

1767
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,470
so uh we can uh create
a bit longer roadmap for for the for the

1768
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:18,480
a bit longer roadmap for for the for the
 

1769
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,589
a bit longer roadmap for for the for the
freight on the ecosystem and

1770
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:21,599
freight on the ecosystem and
 

1771
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,910
freight on the ecosystem and
see a bit further than few months

1772
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:25,920
see a bit further than few months
 

1773
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,630
see a bit further than few months
so what will be going on

1774
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:30,640
so what will be going on
 

1775
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,710
so what will be going on
okay thank you uh any other ideas guys

1776
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:34,720
okay thank you uh any other ideas guys
 

1777
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,270
okay thank you uh any other ideas guys
please

1778
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:35,280
please
 

1779
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,150

well what one question what is the

1782
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:42,720
well what one question what is the
 

1783
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,589
well what one question what is the
status for

1784
00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:43,599
status for
 

1785
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,670
status for
or oracle contest uh oracle contest

1786
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:47,680
or oracle contest uh oracle contest
 

1787
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,950
or oracle contest uh oracle contest
is uh ongoing one

1788
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:50,960
is uh ongoing one
 

1789
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,950
is uh ongoing one
just let me check so so when when is

1790
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:52,960
just let me check so so when when is
 

1791
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,150
just let me check so so when when is
charging an implementation stage

1792
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,160
charging an implementation stage
 

1793
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,270
charging an implementation stage
uh currently it's already in the

1794
00:42:59,270 --> 00:42:59,280
uh currently it's already in the
 

1795
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,829
uh currently it's already in the
implementation stage it's uh 20 days

1796
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:01,839
implementation stage it's uh 20 days
 

1797
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:02,309
implementation stage it's uh 20 days
left

1798
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:02,319
left
 

1799
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,150
left
so it's it will end on july the 8th

1800
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:06,160
so it's it will end on july the 8th
 

1801
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,230
so it's it will end on july the 8th
and after that i think it will be a

1802
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:08,240
and after that i think it will be a
 

1803
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,190
and after that i think it will be a
couple of weeks

1804
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:09,200
couple of weeks
 

1805
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,230
couple of weeks
for for judging

1806
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:14,240

 

1807
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,150

okay well so so basically i would like

1808
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:16,160
okay well so so basically i would like
 

1809
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,510
okay well so so basically i would like
to

1810
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:17,520
to
 

1811
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,190
to
prioritize lending protocol so create

1812
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:21,200
prioritize lending protocol so create
 

1813
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,349
prioritize lending protocol so create
the contest and it should be very simple

1814
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:23,359
the contest and it should be very simple
 

1815
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,190
the contest and it should be very simple
so we basically need

1816
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:25,200
so we basically need
 

1817
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,790
so we basically need
to uh to put collateral in tone

1818
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:28,800
to uh to put collateral in tone
 

1819
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,030
to uh to put collateral in tone
and to get uh usd or usdc or

1820
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:33,040
and to get uh usd or usdc or
 

1821
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,069
and to get uh usd or usdc or
like or uh wrapped version of die

1822
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:36,079
like or uh wrapped version of die
 

1823
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,790
like or uh wrapped version of die
so like this is quite simple it's like

1824
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:38,800
so like this is quite simple it's like
 

1825
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,430
so like this is quite simple it's like
terra

1826
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:39,440
terra
 

1827
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,870
terra
anchor protocol works so they put luna

1828
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:42,880
anchor protocol works so they put luna
 

1829
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,870
anchor protocol works so they put luna
and get the usd so we can

1830
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:44,880
and get the usd so we can
 

1831
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,829
and get the usd so we can
choose like three stable coins that we

1832
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:47,839
choose like three stable coins that we
 

1833
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,550
choose like three stable coins that we
have dropped

1834
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:48,560
have dropped
 

1835
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,230
have dropped
in uh in friton and just so the only

1836
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:52,240
in uh in friton and just so the only
 

1837
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,069
in uh in friton and just so the only
prerequisite is uh

1838
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:54,079
prerequisite is uh
 

1839
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,430
prerequisite is uh
the oracle because we need to to

1840
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:57,440
the oracle because we need to to
 

1841
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,670
the oracle because we need to to
have the price of the tone to to get

1842
00:43:59,670 --> 00:43:59,680
have the price of the tone to to get
 

1843
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,790
have the price of the tone to to get
liquidated so

1844
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:00,800
liquidated so
 

1845
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,349
liquidated so
and to prioritize it because i think

1846
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:03,359
and to prioritize it because i think
 

1847
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,109
and to prioritize it because i think
that we need to

1848
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:05,119
that we need to
 

1849
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,829
that we need to
so focus now on on building primary

1850
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:07,839
so focus now on on building primary
 

1851
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,349
so focus now on on building primary
financial instruments

1852
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:09,359
financial instruments
 

1853
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,630
financial instruments
rather than planning uh like long-term

1854
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:12,640
rather than planning uh like long-term
 

1855
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,230
rather than planning uh like long-term
uh development because like so it's

1856
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:16,240
uh development because like so it's
 

1857
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,589
uh development because like so it's
it it can be a waste of time so i would

1858
00:44:19,589 --> 00:44:19,599
it it can be a waste of time so i would
 

1859
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,230
it it can be a waste of time so i would
suggest to create prayer financial

1860
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:22,240
suggest to create prayer financial
 

1861
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,589
suggest to create prayer financial
primitives

1862
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:23,599
primitives
 

1863
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,710
primitives
first then go with uh long-term planning

1864
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:26,720
first then go with uh long-term planning
 

1865
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,910
first then go with uh long-term planning
how we will

1866
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:27,920
how we will
 

1867
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,390
how we will
um how we'll create new products because

1868
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:30,400
um how we'll create new products because
 

1869
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,430
um how we'll create new products because
like i think that

1870
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:31,440
like i think that
 

1871
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,069
like i think that
there is a problem in coordination so

1872
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:34,079
there is a problem in coordination so
 

1873
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:34,550
there is a problem in coordination so
when the

1874
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:34,560
when the
 

1875
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,710
when the
the couple of teams or several teams

1876
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:36,720
the couple of teams or several teams
 

1877
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,150
the couple of teams or several teams
working on one

1878
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:38,160
working on one
 

1879
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,230
working on one
uh on one type of product which is not

1880
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:40,240
uh on one type of product which is not
 

1881
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,910
uh on one type of product which is not
like very

1882
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:41,920
like very
 

1883
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,390
like very
uh you know very very productive so it's

1884
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:44,400
uh you know very very productive so it's
 

1885
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,109
uh you know very very productive so it's
basically

1886
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:45,119
basically
 

1887
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,190
basically
the best for the market so the market

1888
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:47,200
the best for the market so the market
 

1889
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,030
the best for the market so the market
will choose

1890
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:49,040
will choose
 

1891
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,710
will choose
the most convenient solution but in

1892
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:50,720
the most convenient solution but in
 

1893
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,230
the most convenient solution but in
terms of the uh

1894
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:52,240
terms of the uh
 

1895
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,470
terms of the uh
competitive competition with other

1896
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:54,480
competitive competition with other
 

1897
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,870
competitive competition with other
chains it's like waste of time

1898
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:56,880
chains it's like waste of time
 

1899
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,470
chains it's like waste of time
so basically i think that we need to

1900
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:58,480
so basically i think that we need to
 

1901
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,390
so basically i think that we need to
create financial primitives

1902
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:00,400
create financial primitives
 

1903
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,030
create financial primitives
for the first and then like decide

1904
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,040
for the first and then like decide
 

1905
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,150
for the first and then like decide
probably we need

1906
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:04,160
probably we need
 

1907
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,430
probably we need
to allocate some capital to the

1908
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:07,440
to allocate some capital to the
 

1909
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,550
to allocate some capital to the
concrete team not like a contest

1910
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:10,560
concrete team not like a contest
 

1911
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,990
concrete team not like a contest
uh for some products um

1912
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:14,000
uh for some products um
 

1913
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,589
uh for some products um
very important for infrastructure and

1914
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:15,599
very important for infrastructure and
 

1915
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,309
very important for infrastructure and
then like make contests for

1916
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:18,319
then like make contests for
 

1917
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,430
then like make contests for
like um layer two uh products i mean

1918
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:21,440
like um layer two uh products i mean
 

1919
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,550
like um layer two uh products i mean
layer two like not

1920
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:22,560
layer two like not
 

1921
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,470
layer two like not
uh that utilized uh financial primitives

1922
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:26,480
uh that utilized uh financial primitives
 

1923
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,270
uh that utilized uh financial primitives
rather than

1924
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:27,280
rather than
 

1925
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,870
rather than
create the simple like swapping or loan

1926
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:30,880
create the simple like swapping or loan
 

1927
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,510
create the simple like swapping or loan
or like deposit so like something like

1928
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:33,520
or like deposit so like something like
 

1929
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,550
or like deposit so like something like
uh

1930
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:34,560
uh
 

1931
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:45,030
uh
automated

1932
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:45,040

 

1933
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,470

to be pestici done very soon

1934
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:48,480
to be pestici done very soon
 

1935
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,790
to be pestici done very soon
in order to acquire new because like

1936
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:50,800
in order to acquire new because like
 

1937
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,510
in order to acquire new because like
it's very

1938
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:51,520
it's very
 

1939
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,510
it's very
uh it's very so what is landing

1940
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:53,520
uh it's very so what is landing
 

1941
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,790
uh it's very so what is landing
basically

1942
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:54,800
basically
 

1943
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,390
basically
it's the uh it's a tool to

1944
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:58,400
it's the uh it's a tool to
 

1945
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,069
it's the uh it's a tool to
reduce the selling pressure on the tone

1946
00:46:02,069 --> 00:46:02,079
reduce the selling pressure on the tone
 

1947
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,390
reduce the selling pressure on the tone
so basically those who need liquidity

1948
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:04,400
so basically those who need liquidity
 

1949
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,670
so basically those who need liquidity
will not

1950
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:05,680
will not
 

1951
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,950
will not
sell token yeah will not send

1952
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:08,960
sell token yeah will not send
 

1953
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,550
sell token yeah will not send
the the s the coin they will just put it

1954
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:12,560
the the s the coin they will just put it
 

1955
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,230
the the s the coin they will just put it
as a collateral on take the short term

1956
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:14,240
as a collateral on take the short term
 

1957
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,910
as a collateral on take the short term
liquidity in the entire

1958
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:15,920
liquidity in the entire
 

1959
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,190
liquidity in the entire
usdc so this this is very

1960
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:19,200
usdc so this this is very
 

1961
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,910
usdc so this this is very
um like it will have a good

1962
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:23,920
um like it will have a good
 

1963
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,950
um like it will have a good
uh uh good effect on

1964
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:26,960
uh uh good effect on
 

1965
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,670
uh uh good effect on
on on the price of stone so so basically

1966
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:29,680
on on the price of stone so so basically
 

1967
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,790
on on the price of stone so so basically
the market cap

1968
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:30,800
the market cap
 

1969
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,630
the market cap
of the whole ecosystem uh will will be

1970
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:34,640
of the whole ecosystem uh will will be
 

1971
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,630
of the whole ecosystem uh will will be
um beneficiary of this

1972
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:38,640

 

1973
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,750

so so i would i would suggest to do like

1974
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:41,760
so so i would i would suggest to do like
 

1975
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,069
so so i would i would suggest to do like
to

1976
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:42,079
to
 

1977
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,470
to
create the proposal very quickly and

1978
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:44,480
create the proposal very quickly and
 

1979
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,990
create the proposal very quickly and
just set it up

1980
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:46,000
just set it up
 

1981
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,190
just set it up
and to to be ready to test it when

1982
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:49,200
and to to be ready to test it when
 

1983
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,309
and to to be ready to test it when
uh when the oracle is uh provided so so

1984
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:52,319
uh when the oracle is uh provided so so
 

1985
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,950
uh when the oracle is uh provided so so
we can

1986
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:54,960

 

1987
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,630

so we can have the the working product

1988
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:58,640
so we can have the the working product
 

1989
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,910
so we can have the the working product
by that time okay uh in this case uh

1990
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:01,920
by that time okay uh in this case uh
 

1991
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,910
by that time okay uh in this case uh
i i'm not sure that you will get the

1992
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:03,920
i i'm not sure that you will get the
 

1993
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,829
i i'm not sure that you will get the
product by that time when the oracle

1994
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:05,839
product by that time when the oracle
 

1995
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,150
product by that time when the oracle
contest is finished because you first of

1996
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:08,160
contest is finished because you first of
 

1997
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,990
contest is finished because you first of
all need to integrate with this solution

1998
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:10,000
all need to integrate with this solution
 

1999
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,829
all need to integrate with this solution
and understand how how it works and

2000
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:11,839
and understand how how it works and
 

2001
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,430
and understand how how it works and
there can be different

2002
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:13,440
there can be different
 

2003
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,270
there can be different
different implementations although there

2004
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:15,280
different implementations although there
 

2005
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,550
different implementations although there
is one architecture

2006
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:16,560
is one architecture
 

2007
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,670
is one architecture
so but still it can vary in

2008
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:19,680
so but still it can vary in
 

2009
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,670
so but still it can vary in
implementations

2010
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:23,680

 

2011
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,190

i agree that uh primitives uh

2012
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:27,200
i agree that uh primitives uh
 

2013
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,910
i agree that uh primitives uh
are important but i disagree that we

2014
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:29,920
are important but i disagree that we
 

2015
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,150
are important but i disagree that we
need to focus just on one solution

2016
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:32,160
need to focus just on one solution
 

2017
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,910
need to focus just on one solution
because you never know which solution is

2018
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:33,920
because you never know which solution is
 

2019
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,190
because you never know which solution is
better and

2020
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:35,200
better and
 

2021
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,270
better and
uh in my opinion competition is good

2022
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:37,280
uh in my opinion competition is good
 

2023
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,790
uh in my opinion competition is good
because

2024
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:38,800
because
 

2025
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,829
because
you never know which exact protocol

2026
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:41,839
you never know which exact protocol
 

2027
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,670
you never know which exact protocol
will uh will get

2028
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:45,680
will uh will get
 

2029
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,190
will uh will get
more popular more stable and more secure

2030
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:49,200
more popular more stable and more secure
 

2031
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,109
more popular more stable and more secure
and that's why we are discussing now so

2032
00:47:51,109 --> 00:47:51,119
and that's why we are discussing now so
 

2033
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,390
and that's why we are discussing now so
how we should approach this

2034
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:52,400
how we should approach this
 

2035
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,430
how we should approach this
this thing and and when by the way you

2036
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:55,440
this thing and and when by the way you
 

2037
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:55,829
this thing and and when by the way you
had

2038
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:55,839
had
 

2039
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,190
had
a very good uh presentation on financial

2040
00:47:59,190 --> 00:47:59,200
a very good uh presentation on financial
 

2041
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,230
a very good uh presentation on financial
primitives

2042
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:00,240
primitives
 

2043
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,670
primitives
an architecture of the financial system

2044
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:03,680

i what i would do actually is
 

2057
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,710
i what i would do actually is
keeping in mind the oracle's

by several teams i would

2064
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:29,760
by several teams i would
 

2065
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,030
by several teams i would
run a short contest for two

2066
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:33,040
run a short contest for two
 

2067
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,309
run a short contest for two
or three weeks for some

peculiarity of free tone compared to
 

2075
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,750
peculiarity of free tone compared to
ethereum for example and it shouldn't be

2076
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:49,760
ethereum for example and it shouldn't be
 

2077
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,510
ethereum for example and it shouldn't be
with a big budget definitely but

2078
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:51,520
with a big budget definitely but
 

2079
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,390
with a big budget definitely but
uh it can at least help us to collect

2080
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:54,400
uh it can at least help us to collect
 

2081
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,750
uh it can at least help us to collect
ideas and select

2082
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:55,760
ideas and select
 

2083
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,430
ideas and select
the better architecture from scratch so

2084
00:48:59,430 --> 00:48:59,440
the better architecture from scratch so
 

2085
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,710
the better architecture from scratch so
and not that like every team should

2086
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:02,720
and not that like every team should
 

2087
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,870
and not that like every team should
think about uh

2088
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:06,880

 

2089
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,030

inventing their own will

2090
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:11,040

 

2091
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,710

yes ivan yeah uh speaking about

2092
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:14,720
yes ivan yeah uh speaking about
 

2093
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,670
yes ivan yeah uh speaking about
like that we need to streamline

2094
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:17,680
like that we need to streamline
 

2095
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,790
like that we need to streamline
implementation

2096
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:18,800
implementation
 

2097
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,270
implementation
i'm sorry uh speaking about that that we

2098
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:21,280
i'm sorry uh speaking about that that we
 

2099
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,349
i'm sorry uh speaking about that that we
need to streamline the implementation of

2100
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:23,359
need to streamline the implementation of
 

2101
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,950
need to streamline the implementation of
financial primitives

2102
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:24,960
financial primitives
 

2103
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,870
financial primitives
uh and uh i i i just uh

2104
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:28,880
uh and uh i i i just uh
 

2105
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,950
uh and uh i i i just uh
think that they not really

2106
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:32,960

 

2107
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,870

depends depend on oracle's because

2108
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:36,880
depends depend on oracle's because
 

2109
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,190
depends depend on oracle's because
like oracle is a kind of a price

2110
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:39,200
like oracle is a kind of a price
 

2111
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,030
like oracle is a kind of a price
provider right and you can mock

2112
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,040
provider right and you can mock
 

2113
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,390
provider right and you can mock
it so we can kind of start

2114
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:44,400
it so we can kind of start
 

2115
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,430
it so we can kind of start
developing this financial primitives

2116
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:47,440
developing this financial primitives
 

2117
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,309
developing this financial primitives
assuming that oracle's are already here

2118
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:50,319
assuming that oracle's are already here
 

2119
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,030
assuming that oracle's are already here
and

2120
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,040
and
 

2121
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,950
and
replace the real oracles with some

2122
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:52,960
replace the real oracles with some
 

2123
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,230
replace the real oracles with some
interface and as far as

2124
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:56,240
interface and as far as
 

2125
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,030
interface and as far as
like these oracles will be implemented

2126
00:49:59,030 --> 00:49:59,040
like these oracles will be implemented
 

2127
00:49:59,040 --> 00:49:59,990
like these oracles will be implemented
they will just

2128
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:00,000
they will just
 

2129
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,390
they will just
like incorporate in the existing

2130
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:02,400
like incorporate in the existing
 

2131
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,630
like incorporate in the existing
financial primitives implementation

2132
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:04,640
financial primitives implementation
 

2133
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,990
financial primitives implementation
and so we can parallelize this uh

2134
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:08,000
and so we can parallelize this uh
 

2135
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,990
and so we can parallelize this uh
yeah probably probably yeah

2136
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:12,000
yeah probably probably yeah
 

2137
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,870
yeah probably probably yeah
so it will be just split into phases

2138
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:14,880
so it will be just split into phases
 

2139
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,390
so it will be just split into phases
like the first phase

2140
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:16,400
like the first phase
 

2141
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,549
like the first phase
is the implementation of uh financial

2142
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:18,559
is the implementation of uh financial
 

2143
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,710
is the implementation of uh financial
primitives just a business logic of

2144
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:20,720
primitives just a business logic of
 

2145
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,910
primitives just a business logic of
business logic of it assuming some uh

2146
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:23,920
business logic of it assuming some uh
 

2147
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,950
business logic of it assuming some uh
kind of

2148
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:24,960
kind of
 

2149
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,309
kind of
a mock-up mock of oracle and the second

2150
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:28,319
a mock-up mock of oracle and the second
 

2151
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,950
a mock-up mock of oracle and the second
stage is just integration with uh

2152
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:30,960
stage is just integration with uh
 

2153
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,790
stage is just integration with uh
with oracle solutions which will came up

2154
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:34,800
with oracle solutions which will came up
 

2155
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,150
with oracle solutions which will came up
in in the nearest time it really

2156
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:38,160
in in the nearest time it really
 

2157
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,190
in in the nearest time it really
uh you know my question is

2158
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:41,200
uh you know my question is
 

2159
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,910
uh you know my question is
is oracle obligatory for lending and

2160
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:43,920
is oracle obligatory for lending and
 

2161
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,309
is oracle obligatory for lending and
borrowing protocol

2162
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:46,319
borrowing protocol
 

2163
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,470
borrowing protocol
or there is an alternative without using

2164
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:48,480
or there is an alternative without using
 

2165
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,910
or there is an alternative without using
the oracle

2166
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:49,920
the oracle
 

2167
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,349
the oracle
yeah there is an alternative to

2168
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:53,359
yeah there is an alternative to
 

2169
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:58,069
yeah there is an alternative to
to put uh the risk of undeclared

2170
00:50:58,069 --> 00:50:58,079
to put uh the risk of undeclared
 

2171
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,589
to put uh the risk of undeclared
assets to borrowers to not to borrow

2172
00:51:01,589 --> 00:51:01,599
assets to borrowers to not to borrow
 

2173
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,589
assets to borrowers to not to borrow
splendors cylinders

2174
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:03,599
splendors cylinders
 

2175
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,630
splendors cylinders
yes but it's basically not

2176
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:06,640
yes but it's basically not
 

2177
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,750
yes but it's basically not
it's not a good path to to follow yeah

2178
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:09,760
it's not a good path to to follow yeah
 

2179
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,870
it's not a good path to to follow yeah
so i i probably

2180
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:10,880
so i i probably
 

2181
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,270
so i i probably
i will agree with ivan because like so

2182
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:13,280
i will agree with ivan because like so
 

2183
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,790
i will agree with ivan because like so
oracle is like

2184
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:14,800
oracle is like
 

2185
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,910
oracle is like
a microservice for for this for this

2186
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:17,920
a microservice for for this for this
 

2187
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,790
a microservice for for this for this
product

2188
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:18,800
product
 

2189
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,950
product
so it's like a service you can just mock

2190
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:20,960
so it's like a service you can just mock
 

2191
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,950
so it's like a service you can just mock
it and create the whole logic

2192
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:22,960
it and create the whole logic
 

2193
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,510
it and create the whole logic
just put a constant price of uh free

2194
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:25,520
just put a constant price of uh free
 

2195
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:25,990
just put a constant price of uh free

2196
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:26,000

2197
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,109

as one or two or five as you like and

2198
00:51:29,109 --> 00:51:29,119
as one or two or five as you like and
 

2199
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:29,990
as one or two or five as you like and
just create

2200
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:30,000
just create
 

2201
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,270
just create
the the whole object and and then when

2202
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:33,280
the the whole object and and then when
 

2203
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,230
the the whole object and and then when
the oracle is

2204
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:34,240
the oracle is
 

2205
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,109
the oracle is
is ready i think that the the team that

2206
00:51:37,109 --> 00:51:37,119
is ready i think that the the team that
 

2207
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:37,510
is ready i think that the the team that
will

2208
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:37,520
will
 

2209
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,710
will
done the the best oracle solution

2210
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:40,720
done the the best oracle solution
 

2211
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,430
done the the best oracle solution
will be eager to like integrate the

2212
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:43,440
will be eager to like integrate the
 

2213
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,950
will be eager to like integrate the
oracle into your product

2214
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:44,960
oracle into your product
 

2215
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,910
oracle into your product
so there will be some like synergy

2216
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:47,920
so there will be some like synergy
 

2217
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,150
so there will be some like synergy
between two teams that are working on

2218
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:50,160
between two teams that are working on
 

2219
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,670
between two teams that are working on
on two products so so basically

2220
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:53,680
on two products so so basically
 

2221
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,630
on two products so so basically
because this team that is creating their

2222
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:56,640
because this team that is creating their
 

2223
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,910
because this team that is creating their
oracle will be

2224
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:57,920
oracle will be
 

2225
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,270
oracle will be
uh more likely interested in integrating

2226
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:01,280
uh more likely interested in integrating
 

2227
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,230
uh more likely interested in integrating
into in

2228
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:02,240
into in
 

2229
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,430
into in
spreading the usage and use cases of

2230
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:05,440
spreading the usage and use cases of
 

2231
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,390
spreading the usage and use cases of
their own

2232
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:06,400
their own
 

2233
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,390
their own
oracle solution so basically i think

2234
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:08,400
oracle solution so basically i think
 

2235
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,990
oracle solution so basically i think
that we need to start

2236
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:10,000
that we need to start
 

2237
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,190
that we need to start
um like soon to

2238
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:13,200
um like soon to
 

2239
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,990
um like soon to
the solution uh so the the context of

2240
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:16,000
the solution uh so the the context of
 

2241
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,710
the solution uh so the the context of
landing

2242
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:16,720
landing
 

2243
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,950
landing
is quite it's not very uh

2244
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:18,960
is quite it's not very uh
 

2245
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,069
is quite it's not very uh
straightforward like

2246
00:52:20,069 --> 00:52:20,079
straightforward like
 

2247
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,510
straightforward like
it's it's very straightforward in

2248
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:21,520
it's it's very straightforward in
 

2249
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,870
it's it's very straightforward in
business logic but it is not

2250
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:22,880
business logic but it is not
 

2251
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,870
business logic but it is not
straightforward in terms of the

2252
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:24,880
straightforward in terms of the
 

2253
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,390
straightforward in terms of the
uh asynchronous uh nature of uh

2254
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:28,400
uh asynchronous uh nature of uh
 

2255
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,710
uh asynchronous uh nature of uh
free time transactions but like i i

2256
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:30,720
free time transactions but like i i
 

2257
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,430
free time transactions but like i i
think that

2258
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:31,440
think that
 

2259
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,589
think that
in a month or in the months and a half

2260
00:52:33,589 --> 00:52:33,599
in a month or in the months and a half
 

2261
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,910
in a month or in the months and a half
that the solution will be ready

2262
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:35,920
that the solution will be ready
 

2263
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,109
that the solution will be ready
without uh oracle pricing then we will

2264
00:52:39,109 --> 00:52:39,119
without uh oracle pricing then we will
 

2265
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,309
without uh oracle pricing then we will
work

2266
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:40,319
work
 

2267
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,470
work
uh so i'm not really like these two

2268
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:42,480
uh so i'm not really like these two
 

2269
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,349
uh so i'm not really like these two
teams will work

2270
00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:43,359
teams will work
 

2271
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,549
teams will work
on uh like making the final product with

2272
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:46,559
on uh like making the final product with
 

2273
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,950
on uh like making the final product with
oracle

2274
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:48,960
oracle
 

2275
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,150
oracle
thank you um so

2276
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:52,160
thank you um so
 

2277
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,630
thank you um so
how would uh you see the next steps so

2278
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:56,640
how would uh you see the next steps so
 

2279
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,950
how would uh you see the next steps so
in the end do we need the architecture

2280
00:52:58,950 --> 00:52:58,960
in the end do we need the architecture
 

2281
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,549
in the end do we need the architecture
contest

2282
00:53:00,549 --> 00:53:00,559
contest
 

2283
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,549
contest
because i remember and i agree with

2284
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:02,559
because i remember and i agree with
 

2285
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,150
because i remember and i agree with
meters that we should

2286
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:04,160
meters that we should
 

2287
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,230
meters that we should
because you never know maybe there is

2288
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:06,240
because you never know maybe there is
 

2289
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,630
because you never know maybe there is
some genius idea

2290
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:08,640
some genius idea
 

2291
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,790
some genius idea
lying just nearby you don't see it and

2292
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:12,800
lying just nearby you don't see it and
 

2293
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,069
lying just nearby you don't see it and
this way we let people to

2294
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:16,079
this way we let people to
 

2295
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,549
this way we let people to
to bring it to the surface or we just

2296
00:53:18,549 --> 00:53:18,559
to bring it to the surface or we just
 

2297
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,790
to bring it to the surface or we just
start with a simple implementation

2298
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:20,800
start with a simple implementation
 

2299
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,470
start with a simple implementation
immediately and we'll see

2300
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:24,480
immediately and we'll see
 

2301
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,390
immediately and we'll see
how teams has implemented this

2302
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:28,400
how teams has implemented this
 

2303
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,230
how teams has implemented this
yeah well actually i have i have a

2304
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:30,240
yeah well actually i have i have a
 

2305
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,510
yeah well actually i have i have a
little input on that

2306
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:31,520
little input on that
 

2307
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,030
little input on that
uh that not that

2308
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:35,040
uh that not that
 

2309
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,270
uh that not that
lending without without oracles

2310
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:39,280
lending without without oracles
 

2311
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,549
lending without without oracles
is indeed possible and it it is not

2312
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:42,559
is indeed possible and it it is not
 

2313
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:43,270
is indeed possible and it it is not
really

2314
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:43,280
really
 

2315
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,549
really
so risky as you say so you you don't

2316
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:46,559
so risky as you say so you you don't
 

2317
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:47,349
so risky as you say so you you don't
really need

2318
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:47,359
really need
 

2319
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,470
really need
to put a risk on a on a loaner

2320
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:50,480
to put a risk on a on a loaner
 

2321
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,589
to put a risk on a on a loaner
but you also can like involve some

2322
00:53:53,589 --> 00:53:53,599
but you also can like involve some
 

2323
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,150
but you also can like involve some
third-party insurance provider which

2324
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:56,160
third-party insurance provider which
 

2325
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,910
third-party insurance provider which
will put some stake

2326
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:57,920
will put some stake
 

2327
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,630
will put some stake
and earn rewards and some token and

2328
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:00,640
and earn rewards and some token and
 

2329
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,829
and earn rewards and some token and
there is a project

2330
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:01,839
there is a project
 

2331
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:06,790
there is a project
in in in ontology ecosystem

00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:08,720
i i'm not really remember it called
 

2335
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,470
i i'm not really remember it called
weakness yes

2336
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:10,480
weakness yes
 

2337
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,109
weakness yes
and there is also next mutual who does

2338
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:13,119
and there is also next mutual who does
 

2339
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,790
and there is also next mutual who does
this

2340
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:14,800
this
 

2341
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,790
this
yeah well yeah i don't know who will who

2342
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:16,800
yeah well yeah i don't know who will who
 

2343
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,630
yeah well yeah i don't know who will who
will really do it but but

2344
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:18,640
will really do it but but
 

2345
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,950
will really do it but but
the the the idea is just here in the

2346
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:20,960
the the the idea is just here in the
 

2347
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,190
the the the idea is just here in the
ecosystem so

2348
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:23,200
ecosystem so
 

2349
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,790
ecosystem so
well yeah just a note

2350
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:25,800
well yeah just a note

i see uh here some
 

2359
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,750
i see uh here some
some questions uh a big number of

2360
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:41,760
some questions uh a big number of
 

2361
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,190
some questions uh a big number of
questions actually so

2362
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:43,200
questions actually so
 

2363
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,390
questions actually so
on how to do this so uh

2364
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:46,400
on how to do this so uh
 

2365
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,150
on how to do this so uh
what i would propose is still

2366
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:50,160
what i would propose is still
 

2367
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,190
what i would propose is still

could be formal specification right

2378
00:55:08,789 --> 00:55:08,799
could be formal specification right
 

2379
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,589
could be formal specification right
informal specification yeah just maybe

2380
00:55:11,589 --> 00:55:11,599

to create a fruitful ground for ideas

2384
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:14,960
to create a fruitful ground for ideas
 

2385
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,309
to create a fruitful ground for ideas
uh for implementation and right after

2386
00:55:18,309 --> 00:55:18,319
uh for implementation and right after
 

2387
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:22,630
uh for implementation and right after
uh have provided to teams who would like

2388
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:22,640
uh have provided to teams who would like
 

2389
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,390
uh have provided to teams who would like
to participate in the implementation

2390
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:24,400
to participate in the implementation

contest
 

2393
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,309
contest
uh because in any case everyone will be

2394
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:28,319
uh because in any case everyone will be
 

2395
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,109
uh because in any case everyone will be
implementing their

2396
00:55:29,109 --> 00:55:29,119
implementing their
 

2397
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,870
implementing their
own architecture and we learned this

2398
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:30,880
own architecture and we learned this
 

2399
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,030
own architecture and we learned this
from our past contests

2400
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:33,040
from our past contests
 

2401
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,309

then

2424
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:02,720
then
 

2425
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,030
then
and go into the implementation stage

2426
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,040

 

2427
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,309

in this case uh i propose

in this case uh i propose
 

2429
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:13,190
in this case uh i propose
maybe i will draft this contest tomorrow

2430
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:13,200
maybe i will draft this contest tomorrow
 

2431
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,470
maybe i will draft this contest tomorrow
and

2432
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:14,480
and
 

2433
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,430
and
let's just launch it from monday and uh

2434
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:17,440
let's just launch it from monday and uh
 

2435
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,309
let's just launch it from monday and uh
give

2436

such an insane
 

2441
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,030
such an insane
and right after so we'll follow the

2442
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:25,040
and right after so we'll follow the
 

2443
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:25,990
and right after so we'll follow the
first stage of

2444
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:26,000
first stage of
 

2445
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,190
first stage of

so uh it's it
in it's in a structural uh

2464
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:51,760
in it's in a structural uh
 

2465
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,309
in it's in a structural uh
phase or in implementation

2466

phase or in implementation
 

2467
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:56,230
phase or in implementation
implementation so actually

2468
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:56,240
implementation so actually
 

2469
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,990
implementation so actually
we discussed this uh several times and

2470
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:00,000
we discussed this uh several times and
 

2471
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,430
we discussed this uh several times and
decided that uh to launch it

2472
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:03,440
decided that uh to launch it
 

2473
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,510
decided that uh to launch it
right away so we just detailed the

2474
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:05,520
right away so we just detailed the
 

2475
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,270
right away so we just detailed the
specification with pavel

2476
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:07,280
specification with pavel
 

2477
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,390
specification with pavel
and now it seems seems okay

2478
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:10,400
and now it seems seems okay
 

2479
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,750
and now it seems seems okay
and we will see the current uh

2480
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:13,760
and we will see the current uh
 

2481
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,349
and we will see the current uh
what we will get from from teams

2482
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:15,359
what we will get from from teams
 

2483
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:20,230
what we will get from from teams
actually okay right

2484
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:20,240

 

2485
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,710

all right so we have five more minutes

2521
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,670

because i remember there was a quite
 

2523
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,190
because i remember there was a quite
good introduction on the

2524
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:05,200
good introduction on the
 

2525
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,910
good introduction on the
sequence actually of financial

2526
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:07,920
sequence actually of financial
 

2527
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:08,789
sequence actually of financial
instruments

2528
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:08,799

2529
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,829

uh that should be implemented it is uh

2530
00:58:11,829 --> 00:58:11,839
uh that should be implemented it is uh
 

2531
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,910
uh that should be implemented it is uh
the slide number four

the slide number four
 

2533
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,750
the slide number four
actually so the zero level

2534
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:15,760
actually so the zero level
 

2535
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,030
actually so the zero level
infrastructure level

2536
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:17,040
infrastructure level
 

2537
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,030
infrastructure level
and financial primitives and basic

2538
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:19,040
and financial primitives and basic
 

2539
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,470
and financial primitives and basic
middleware then

2540
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:20,480
middleware then
 

2541
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,750
middleware then
uh advanced uh middleware and basic

2542
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:23,760
uh advanced uh middleware and basic
 

2543
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,589
uh advanced uh middleware and basic
financial products and finally some

2544
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:25,599
financial products and finally some
 

2545
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,589
financial products and finally some
structured financial products

2546
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:27,599
structured financial products
 

2547
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,549
structured financial products
uh this is yeah this is quite a quite

2548
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:30,559
uh this is yeah this is quite a quite
 

2549
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:31,750
uh this is yeah this is quite a quite
quite nice

2550
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:31,760
quite nice
 

2551
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:40,230
quite nice
thing to ground the roadmap

2552
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:40,240

 

2553
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,349

okay uh

2554
00:58:43,349 --> 00:58:43,359
okay uh
 

2555
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:45,910
okay uh
