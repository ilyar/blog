1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,790

okay

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:02,800
okay
 

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,349
okay
so maybe let me start from from a couple

4
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:05,359
so maybe let me start from from a couple
 

5
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,430
so maybe let me start from from a couple
of kind of philosophical remarks and

6
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:07,440
of kind of philosophical remarks and
 

7
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,629
of kind of philosophical remarks and
then i'll hand over to sergey and

8
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:10,639
then i'll hand over to sergey and
 

9
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,709
then i'll hand over to sergey and
or maybe somebody else from the alliance

10
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:12,719
or maybe somebody else from the alliance
 

11
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,110
or maybe somebody else from the alliance
to to give a more detailed answer

12
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,120
to to give a more detailed answer
 

13
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,430
to to give a more detailed answer
about the ever scale never price

14
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,440
about the ever scale never price
 

15
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,429
about the ever scale never price
so i mean just on the bigger picture

16
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:19,439
so i mean just on the bigger picture
 

17
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,590
so i mean just on the bigger picture
what happened it's it's very clear with

18
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
what happened it's it's very clear with
 

19
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,509
what happened it's it's very clear with
the overall market there was an

20
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:23,519
the overall market there was an
 

21
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,670
the overall market there was an
extremely intense injection of liquidity

22
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
extremely intense injection of liquidity
 

23
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,790
extremely intense injection of liquidity
in the last

24
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
in the last
 

25
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,550
in the last
few years and particularly in the last

26
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,560
few years and particularly in the last
 

27
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,109
few years and particularly in the last
couple of years since quite time

28
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,119
couple of years since quite time
 

29
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,110
couple of years since quite time
like 40 percent of all printed dollars

30
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
like 40 percent of all printed dollars
 

31
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,110
like 40 percent of all printed dollars
were printed in the last couple of years

32
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,120
were printed in the last couple of years
 

33
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,790
were printed in the last couple of years
and of course that liquidity was going

34
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
and of course that liquidity was going
 

35
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,190
and of course that liquidity was going
all over the place including in the

36
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,200
all over the place including in the
 

37
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,110
all over the place including in the
crypto segment uh there was my safe

38
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
crypto segment uh there was my safe
 

39
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,470
crypto segment uh there was my safe
injection of liquidity in the crypto

40
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
injection of liquidity in the crypto
 

41
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,510
injection of liquidity in the crypto
segment

42
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,520
segment
 

43
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,229
segment
and which which is a risk asset

44
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:46,239
and which which is a risk asset
 

45
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,430
and which which is a risk asset
so when basically us reversed the

46
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
so when basically us reversed the
 

47
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,590
so when basically us reversed the
quantitative easing and stopped

48
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
quantitative easing and stopped
 

49
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,590
quantitative easing and stopped
injecting money into the market of

50
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,600
injecting money into the market of
 

51
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,029
injecting money into the market of
course

52
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
course
 

53
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,709
course
everybody became risk averse and

54
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:56,719
everybody became risk averse and
 

55
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,670
everybody became risk averse and
liquidity started going away from the

56
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
liquidity started going away from the
 

57
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,189
liquidity started going away from the
from the global markets from the stock

58
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
from the global markets from the stock
 

59
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,830
from the global markets from the stock
market and of course uh

60
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
market and of course uh
 

61
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,910
market and of course uh
the crypto market typically reacts first

62
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
the crypto market typically reacts first
 

63
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,510
the crypto market typically reacts first
because this is still one of the most

64
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
because this is still one of the most
 

65
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,230
because this is still one of the most
volatile and risk assets so that's one

66
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
volatile and risk assets so that's one
 

67
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,950
volatile and risk assets so that's one
kind of big reason the reason why crypto

68
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
kind of big reason the reason why crypto
 

69
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,710
kind of big reason the reason why crypto
fell more than the stock markets for

70
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
fell more than the stock markets for
 

71
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,910
fell more than the stock markets for
example

72
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:15,920
example
 

73
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,109
example
is uh

74
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119
is uh
 

75
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,429
is uh
is partially because it's a more risky

76
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
is partially because it's a more risky
 

77
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,190
is partially because it's a more risky
asset

78
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
asset
 

79
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,670
asset
as is judged by the investment banks

80
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,680
as is judged by the investment banks
 

81
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,789
as is judged by the investment banks
for now

82
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
for now
 

83
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,190
for now
and uh partially because of the terror

84
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
and uh partially because of the terror
 

85
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,149
and uh partially because of the terror
crash

86
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
crash
 

87
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,310
crash
and current terror luna crash and

88
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
and current terror luna crash and
 

89
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,789
and current terror luna crash and
current celsius crash which is happening

90
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
current celsius crash which is happening
 

91
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,109
current celsius crash which is happening
which might trigger some more you know

92
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:35,119
which might trigger some more you know
 

93
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,710
which might trigger some more you know
negative waves

94
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
negative waves
 

95
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,270
negative waves
and of course sever is the part of the

96
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
and of course sever is the part of the
 

97
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,350
and of course sever is the part of the
global market as you could see our

98
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
global market as you could see our
 

99
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,149
global market as you could see our
trading volumes and uh grew recently but

100
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
trading volumes and uh grew recently but
 

101
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,230
trading volumes and uh grew recently but
i'm sure sergey will comment about that

102
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
i'm sure sergey will comment about that
 

103
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,190
i'm sure sergey will comment about that
or somebody else so of course uh we're

104
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
or somebody else so of course uh we're
 

105
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,910
or somebody else so of course uh we're
now more kind of linked uh as they were

106
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920
now more kind of linked uh as they were
 

107
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,389
now more kind of linked uh as they were
more linked with the you know more

108
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:54,399
more linked with the you know more
 

109
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,469
more linked with the you know more
correlated with the crypto market so

110
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
correlated with the crypto market so
 

111
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,510
correlated with the crypto market so
that's why we fell more or less

112
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:58,520
that's why we fell more or less
 

113
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,149
that's why we fell more or less
professionally proportionately with the

114
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
professionally proportionately with the
 

115
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,109
professionally proportionately with the
market so i'll probably stop at this big

116
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
market so i'll probably stop at this big
 

117
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,590
market so i'll probably stop at this big
picture remark and hand over to

118
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
picture remark and hand over to
 

119
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,270
picture remark and hand over to
sergey and team to give more comments

120
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280

 

121
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,910

yeah yeah for for brock's it's not first

122
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
yeah yeah for for brock's it's not first
 

123
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,229
yeah yeah for for brock's it's not first
and not second crypt of winter in uh

124
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
and not second crypt of winter in uh
 

125
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,510
and not second crypt of winter in uh
first crypto winter brooks was

126
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
first crypto winter brooks was
 

127
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,949
first crypto winter brooks was
establishment

128
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
establishment
 

129
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,670
establishment
in second crypto winter broxles grow

130
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:21,680
in second crypto winter broxles grow
 

131
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,030
in second crypto winter broxles grow
from 25 people up to 100 people

132
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
from 25 people up to 100 people
 

133
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,550
from 25 people up to 100 people
and

134
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
and
 

135
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,869
and
in crypto inter it's

136
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
in crypto inter it's
 

137
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,750
in crypto inter it's
more cheaper to hire new people like a

138
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
more cheaper to hire new people like a
 

139
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,430
more cheaper to hire new people like a
new developer especially

140
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
new developer especially
 

141
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,270
new developer especially
and also marketing repair activity

142
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,280
and also marketing repair activity
 

143
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,710
and also marketing repair activity
activities

144
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
activities
 

145
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,750
activities
became

146
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
became
 

147
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,949
became
um

148
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
um
 

149
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,589
um
five six weeks cheaper too

150
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
five six weeks cheaper too
 

151
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,229
five six weeks cheaper too
so uh for us it's um

152
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
so uh for us it's um
 

153
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,710
so uh for us it's um
it's good time for for marketing uh

154
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
it's good time for for marketing uh
 

155
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,470
it's good time for for marketing uh
because now it's not too expensive like

156
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
because now it's not too expensive like
 

157
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,790
because now it's not too expensive like
it was five six

158
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
it was five six
 

159
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,470
it was five six
uh months ago

160
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
uh months ago
 

161
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,070
uh months ago
uh in terms of security yes uh liquidity

162
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
uh in terms of security yes uh liquidity
 

163
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,830
uh in terms of security yes uh liquidity
went away from a lot of the fire

164
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
went away from a lot of the fire
 

165
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,910
went away from a lot of the fire
protocols but

166
00:02:59,910 --> 00:02:59,920
protocols but
 

167
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,910
protocols but
from fulfilling for example

168
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
from fulfilling for example
 

169
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,350
from fulfilling for example
maybe ten percent uh liquidity was went

170
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
maybe ten percent uh liquidity was went
 

171
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,589
maybe ten percent uh liquidity was went
to another network and that's all

172
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
to another network and that's all
 

173

583
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,110
everscale.network website and i think
that in a couple of weeks we will update

that in a couple of weeks we will update
 

585

that in a couple of weeks we will update
uh that roadmap uh with more details and

uh that roadmap uh with more details and
 

587
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,069
uh that roadmap uh with more details and
i hope hope that probably will be able

i hope hope that probably will be able
 

589
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,630
i hope hope that probably will be able
to deliver some protocol updates uh

590
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
to deliver some protocol updates uh
 

591

919
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,070
does every scale only goes down together
with the market but never up

920
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080

 

921

i can try to answer that uh

922
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,200
i can try to answer that uh
 

923
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,909
i can try to answer that uh
first of all it is actually

about going down
usually most of the time it goes down a

930
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:58,720
usually most of the time it goes down a
 

931
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,230
usually most of the time it goes down a
little bit less than most of the

932
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
little bit less than most of the

uh second of all people still remember
 

937
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,070
uh second of all people still remember
the

938
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,080
the
 

939
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,029
the
bull market of end of 2020 beginning of

940
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:09,039
bull market of end of 2020 beginning of

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
2021
 

943
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,350
2021
that

944
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
that
 

945
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,669
that
we didn't catch unfortunately and that

946
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:13,679
we didn't catch unfortunately and that
 

947
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,310
we didn't catch unfortunately and that
was the the the actually the only

948
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
was the the the actually the only
 

949
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,190
was the the the actually the only
uh situation where the markets just had

950
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
uh situation where the markets just had
 

951
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,150
uh situation where the markets just had
a rise and we didn't so

952
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,160
a rise and we didn't so
 

953
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,470
a rise and we didn't so
um it is actually not true

954
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
um it is actually not true
 

955
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,430
um it is actually not true
it is true that we have actually

956
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:27,440
it is true that we have actually
 

957
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,549
it is true that we have actually
told the token price fell uh

958
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:30,559
told the token price fell uh
 

959
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,630
told the token price fell uh
quite a lot from the initial

960
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:34,640

 

961
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,430

price uh that were

962
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
price uh that were
 

963
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,070
price uh that were
listed when we got listed on the changes

964
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
listed when we got listed on the changes
 

965
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,549
listed when we got listed on the changes
maybe maybe it is uh just um

966
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
maybe maybe it is uh just um
 

967
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,310
maybe maybe it is uh just um
you know the price discovery at that

968
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
you know the price discovery at that
 

969
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,549
you know the price discovery at that
time maybe was just a little off but

970
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:48,559
time maybe was just a little off but
 

971
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,230
time maybe was just a little off but
um

972
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,240
um
 

973
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,070
um
actually now we became

974
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,080
actually now we became
 

975
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,430
actually now we became
correlating with the market and uh

976
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,440
correlating with the market and uh
 

977
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,430
correlating with the market and uh
i think that's more a good thing than

978
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,440
i think that's more a good thing than
 

979
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,390
i think that's more a good thing than
the bad because when uh

980
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:00,400
the bad because when uh
 

981
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,909
the bad because when uh
when the token doesn't uh

982
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
when the token doesn't uh
 

983
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,750
when the token doesn't uh
you know the price of the token uh

984
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
you know the price of the token uh
 

985
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,029
you know the price of the token uh
doesn't have any correlations with the

986
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039
doesn't have any correlations with the
 

987
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,110
doesn't have any correlations with the
market usually it scares off investors

988
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,120
market usually it scares off investors
 

989
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,350
market usually it scares off investors
because it usually means that there are

990
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,360
because it usually means that there are
 

991
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,350
because it usually means that there are
manipulations in the market with our

992
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,360
manipulations in the market with our
 

993
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,990
manipulations in the market with our
situation it is uh fair and square

994
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
situation it is uh fair and square
 

995
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,110
situation it is uh fair and square
you know we

996
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
you know we
 

997
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,150
you know we
now are just a normal participant of the

998
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160
now are just a normal participant of the
 

999
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,950
now are just a normal participant of the
crypto market so

1000
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
crypto market so
 

1001
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,870
crypto market so
i don't see that as a problem i see that

1002
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
i don't see that as a problem i see that
 

1003
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,590
i don't see that as a problem i see that
as a plus that we correlate but again we

1004
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:27,600
as a plus that we correlate but again we
 

1005
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,510
as a plus that we correlate but again we
try to uh

1006
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
try to uh
 

1007
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,310
try to uh
uh

1008
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,320
uh
 

1009
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,950
uh
have correlations that you know we we

1010
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:32,960
have correlations that you know we we
 

1011
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,390
have correlations that you know we we
rise a little bit more when the market

1012
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:34,400
rise a little bit more when the market
 

1013
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,029
rise a little bit more when the market
rises uh fall a little bit uh more or

1014
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
rises uh fall a little bit uh more or
 

1015
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,950
rises uh fall a little bit uh more or
less than one american falls so we just

1016
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:38,960
less than one american falls so we just
 

1017
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,470
less than one american falls so we just
were working on it but again the

1018
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,480
were working on it but again the
 

1019
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,470
were working on it but again the
correlations i think it it's not a bad

1020
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480
correlations i think it it's not a bad
 

1021
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,590
correlations i think it it's not a bad
thing

1022
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600

will be uh
 

1109
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,950
will be uh
a burn of 1 billion tokens

about about about about historical
 

1117
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,630
about about about about historical
uh maybe it's a good idea to burn some

1118
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
uh maybe it's a good idea to burn some
 

1119
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,990
uh maybe it's a good idea to burn some
of treasury

1120

yes and there to that so there are

00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
yes and there to that so there are
 

1193
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,669
yes and there to that so there are
also possibilities like

so it means that that will be limited

1212
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:33,600
so it means that that will be limited
 

1213
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,350
so it means that that will be limited
supply and there will be no growth of

1214
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:37,360
supply and there will be no growth of
 

1215
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,110
supply and there will be no growth of
supply over the time

1216
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,120
supply over the time
 

1217
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,950
supply over the time
uh

1218
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:40,960
uh
 

1219
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,430
uh
this is one idea how you can use that

1220
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:43,440
this is one idea how you can use that
 

1221
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,710
this is one idea how you can use that
billion also the billing can be used as

1222
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:46,720
billion also the billing can be used as
 

1223
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,950
billion also the billing can be used as
for stable coin

1224
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:50,960

 

1225
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,950

can be done that way so there's a number

1226
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:52,960
can be done that way so there's a number
 

1227
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,190
can be done that way so there's a number
of ways how those tokens can be used for

1228
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
of ways how those tokens can be used for
 

1229
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,350
of ways how those tokens can be used for
the benefit of the ecosystem we'll add

1230
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,360
the benefit of the ecosystem we'll add

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,070
the benefit of the ecosystem we'll add
tvl by the way in the ecosystem and will

1232
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,080
tvl by the way in the ecosystem and will
 

1233
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,070
tvl by the way in the ecosystem and will
not go to the market schedule

1234
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,080

 

1235
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,230

just small remark for me uh joint

1236
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,240
just small remark for me uh joint
 

1237
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,430
just small remark for me uh joint
joining in uh surrogate bible is that if

1238
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,440
joining in uh surrogate bible is that if
 

1239
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,870
joining in uh surrogate bible is that if
there is a way

1240
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:12,880
there is a way

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,549
there is a way
the token said well you're not hitting

1242
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
the token said well you're not hitting
 

1243
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,710

the market it's actually preferred way

1244
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:16,720
the market it's actually preferred way
 

1245
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,350
the market it's actually preferred way
because when you burn you decrease the

1246
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,360
because when you burn you decrease the
 

1247
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,350
because when you burn you decrease the
fully diluted market cap as well so if

1248
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:21,360
fully diluted market cap as well so if
 

1249
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,190
fully diluted market cap as well so if
there is a good there is a good idea how

00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,200
there is a good there is a good idea how
 

1251
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,870
there is a good there is a good idea how
to spend those tokens it's a better way

1252
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:24,880
to spend those tokens it's a better way
 

1253
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,430
to spend those tokens it's a better way

1261
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,350
like in corporate finance
you have to see

1262
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,360
you have to see
 

1263
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,430
you have to see
what the uh

1264
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,440
what the uh
 

1265
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,669
what the uh
capitalization table looks like

1266
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:41,679
capitalization table looks like
 

1267
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,269
capitalization table looks like
and if a project has too much

1268
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:45,279
and if a project has too much
 

1269
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,630
and if a project has too much
liquidity

1270
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:46,640
liquidity
 

1271
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,110

locked in the treasury so basically very

1272
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
locked in the treasury so basically very
 

1273
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,590

and vice versa when you don't have any

1278
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:54,720
and vice versa when you don't have any
 

1279

overhead

1280
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:55,840
overhead
 

1281
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,830
overhead
that's not actually a good thing

1282
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:57,840
that's not actually a good thing
 

1283
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,190
that's not actually a good thing
we have um now about 40

1284
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,200
we have um now about 40
 

1285
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,430
we have um now about 40
of our total supply locked

1286
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,440
of our total supply locked
 

1287
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,310
of our total supply locked
and about 60 in circulating supply

1288
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,320
and about 60 in circulating supply
 

1289
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,149
and about 60 in circulating supply
actually most of this replacement is

1290
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:08,159
actually most of this replacement is
 

1291
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,750
actually most of this replacement is
also long but locked on the validators

1292
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:09,760
also long but locked on the validators
 

1293
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,510
also long but locked on the validators
and everything but the treasury is about

1294
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
and everything but the treasury is about
 

1295
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,909

800 million tokens i believe if i'm

and
 

1301
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,909
and
that is a good thing that means that

1302
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:19,919
that is a good thing that means that
 

1303
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,470
that is a good thing that means that
we have some overhead to development

1304

we have some overhead to development
 

1305
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,750
we have some overhead to development
we have some

we have some

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,549
we have some
overheads you know two to

um
 

1315
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,470
um
we do not want to mess up the

00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,480
we do not want to mess up the
 

1317
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,190
we do not want to mess up the

because you know burning tokens from the

1320
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:39,440
because you know burning tokens from the
 

1321
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,269
because you know burning tokens from the
definition is

1322
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:41,279

the process that can not be reversed
 

1325
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,909
the process that can not be reversed
if we you know burn the tokens actually

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,510
cannot basically create
extra tokens uh using a magic wand so

1334
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:55,520
extra tokens uh using a magic wand so
 

1335
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,549
extra tokens uh using a magic wand so
all these

00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:56,559
all these
 

1337
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,230
all these
uh you know manipulations with a total

1338
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,240
uh you know manipulations with a total
 

1339
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,669
uh you know manipulations with a total
supply should be done super super

1340
00:25:59,669 --> 00:25:59,679
supply should be done super super
 

1341
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,549
supply should be done super super
carefully um and uh

1342
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:02,559
carefully um and uh
 

1343
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,510
carefully um and uh
because it can actually lead to a lot of

00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:05,520
because it can actually lead to a lot of
 

1345
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,710
because it can actually lead to a lot of
negative stuff

1346
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:06,720
negative stuff
 

1347
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,190

people propose to burn more tokens
 

1351
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,070
people propose to burn more tokens
now it will do from my point of view it

1352
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,080
now it will do from my point of view it
 

1353
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,710
now it will do from my point of view it
will do more hard than good but again

1354
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:16,720
will do more hard than good but again
 

1355
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,630
will do more hard than good but again
all these manipulations with total

1356
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:18,640
all these manipulations with total
 

1357
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,230
all these manipulations with total
supply should be done very carefully and

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,590
if we decide to do something we will
calculate it uh very carefully and show

1362
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:25,600
calculate it uh very carefully and show
 

1363
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,990
calculate it uh very carefully and show
the calculation to the human difference

1364
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000
the calculation to the human difference
 

1365
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,909
the calculation to the human difference
i think i think uh people ask for them

1366
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:29,919
i think i think uh people ask for them
 

1367
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,430
i think i think uh people ask for them
beyond recognized because

1368

beyond recognized because
 

1369
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,149
beyond recognized because
in in reality we want to not allow to go

is we know only one way beyond but it's

1374
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:41,440
is we know only one way beyond but it's
 

1375

the question not of decreasing the total
supply is decreasing the free flow

1392
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,240
supply is decreasing the free flow
 

1393
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,590
supply is decreasing the free flow
there's the free flow does the problem

1394
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:03,600
there's the free flow does the problem
 

1395
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,549
there's the free flow does the problem
say i agree yes yes so uh yes and and

duke dubla do you want to comment
briefly on the bridges on what's the

1776
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:01,839
briefly on the bridges on what's the
 

1777
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,790
briefly on the bridges on what's the
latest what's maybe coming um on the

1778
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:04,800
latest what's maybe coming um on the
 

1779
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,950
latest what's maybe coming um on the
overall region infrastructure because

1780
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:06,960
overall region infrastructure because
 

1781
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,950
overall region infrastructure because
that's one subject we didn't touch yet

1782
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:08,960
that's one subject we didn't touch yet
 

1783
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,310
that's one subject we didn't touch yet
in the school

1784
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:10,320
in the school
 

1785
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,870
in the school
uh yeah actually so the

1786
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:12,880
uh yeah actually so the
 

1787
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,030
uh yeah actually so the
nearest feature to to come so maybe

1788
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,040
nearest feature to to come so maybe
 

1789
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,190
nearest feature to to come so maybe
let's just stop uh

1790
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,200
let's just stop uh
 

1791
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,589
let's just stop uh
on the recently announced features that

1792
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:21,599
on the recently announced features that
 

1793
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,030
on the recently announced features that
have been released so uh the uh first

1794
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,040
have been released so uh the uh first
 

1795
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,349
have been released so uh the uh first
and major one is the merge of the tokens

1796
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:27,359
and major one is the merge of the tokens
 

1797
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,990
and major one is the merge of the tokens
meaning that now you can

1798
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,000
meaning that now you can
 

1799
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,870
meaning that now you can
match

1800
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:30,880
match
 

1801
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,270
match
several tokens from different networks

1802
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:33,280
several tokens from different networks
 

1803
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,470
several tokens from different networks
being

1804
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:34,480
being
 

1805
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,470
being
one and single token

1806
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:36,480
one and single token
 

1807
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,190
one and single token
and this way you can easily control uh

1808
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:39,200
and this way you can easily control uh
 

1809
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,630
and this way you can easily control uh
your

1810
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:40,640
your
 

1811
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,030
your
the whole flow of your tokens

1812
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,040
the whole flow of your tokens
 

1813
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,870
the whole flow of your tokens
for your user base

1814
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:44,880
for your user base
 

1815
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,390
for your user base
and

1816
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:46,400
and
 

1817
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,470
and
easily

1818
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:48,480
easily
 

1819
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,950
easily
transfer them from any network to any

1820
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:50,960
transfer them from any network to any
 

1821
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,750
transfer them from any network to any
network so if they follow the merging

1822
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:53,760
network so if they follow the merging
 

1823
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,190
network so if they follow the merging
procedure so we will announce the merger

1824
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:57,200
procedure so we will announce the merger
 

1825
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,470
procedure so we will announce the merger
procedure so soon

1826
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:00,480
procedure so soon
 

1827
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,550
procedure so soon
hopefully within a week so it will

1828
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:02,560
hopefully within a week so it will
 

1829
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,349
hopefully within a week so it will
explain who we should contact with uh

1830
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:05,359
explain who we should contact with uh
 

1831
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,270
explain who we should contact with uh
which proofs and which information

1832
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:07,280
which proofs and which information
 

1833
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,470
which proofs and which information
should provide

1834
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:08,480
should provide
 

1835
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,910
should provide
so

1836
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:09,920
so
 

1837
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,510
so
to be able to merge

1838
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:11,520
to be able to merge
 

1839
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,829
to be able to merge
your tokens in different networks for a

1840
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:13,839
your tokens in different networks for a
 

1841
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,030
your tokens in different networks for a
bridge to operate it natively

1842
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,040
bridge to operate it natively
 

1843
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,870
bridge to operate it natively
and the next uh

1844
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:18,880
and the next uh
 

1845
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,030
and the next uh
closest feature to come

1846
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,040
closest feature to come
 

1847
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,310
closest feature to come
is a bridge

1848
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:22,320
is a bridge
 

1849
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,630
is a bridge
to solana so it is 95 percent ready and

1850
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:26,640
to solana so it is 95 percent ready and
 

1851
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,990
to solana so it is 95 percent ready and
now we are passing the security check so

1852
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,000
now we are passing the security check so
 

1853
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,230
now we are passing the security check so
and also looking for auditors

1854
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,240
and also looking for auditors
 

1855
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,310
and also looking for auditors
so and very soon uh

1856
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:34,320
so and very soon uh
 

1857
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,790
so and very soon uh
we are expecting it to be released so

1858
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:36,800
we are expecting it to be released so
 

1859
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,790
we are expecting it to be released so
this way salana will also become

1860
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:38,800
this way salana will also become
 

1861
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,390
this way salana will also become
connected to

1862
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:40,400
connected to
 

1863
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:50,150
connected to
everscale

1864
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,160

 

1865
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,990

now
 

1875
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,750
now
i'm talking about major features but

1876
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:03,760
i'm talking about major features but
 

1877
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,829
i'm talking about major features but
also you will see some a lot of

1878
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:05,839
also you will see some a lot of
 

1879
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,270
also you will see some a lot of
good ui tweaks now interface

1880
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,280
good ui tweaks now interface
 

1881
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,950
good ui tweaks now interface
so maybe you have seen that we have

1882
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:10,960
so maybe you have seen that we have
 

1883
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,750
so maybe you have seen that we have
recently launched the landing page

1884
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:13,760
recently launched the landing page
 

1885
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,990
recently launched the landing page
of the of the bridge shown some good

1886
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,000
of the of the bridge shown some good
 

1887
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,430
of the of the bridge shown some good
stats uh so quite a lot of mining
