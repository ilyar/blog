uh thank you for annotation
um yeah so um in a few words uh next few

34
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
um yeah so um in a few words uh next few
 

35
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,869
um yeah so um in a few words uh next few
days we're gonna have a very

36
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:58,879
days we're gonna have a very
 

37
00:00:58,879 --> 00:00:59,910
days we're gonna have a very
uh

38
00:00:59,910 --> 00:00:59,920
uh
 

39
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,590
uh
important uh

40
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,600
important uh
 

41
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,070
important uh
process called migration

42
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
process called migration
 

43
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,030
process called migration
uh basically it's about launching new

44
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
uh basically it's about launching new
 

45
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,390
uh basically it's about launching new
token standard in the everscale network

46
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:10,400
token standard in the everscale network
 

47
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,750
token standard in the everscale network
so which is uh also important it affects

48
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
so which is uh also important it affects
 

49
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,390
so which is uh also important it affects
probably every existing product on every

50
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
probably every existing product on every
 

51
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,950
probably every existing product on every
scale you know like bridge

52
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
scale you know like bridge
 

53
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,190
scale you know like bridge
dexes uh

54
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
dexes uh
 

55
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,830
dexes uh
wallets block explorers and so on uh so

56
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:25,840
wallets block explorers and so on uh so
 

57
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,710
wallets block explorers and so on uh so
it's not only about updating the token

58
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
it's not only about updating the token
 

59
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,350
it's not only about updating the token
uh but also about updating every single

60
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
uh but also about updating every single
 

61
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,390
uh but also about updating every single
product that works with token

62
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
product that works with token
 

63
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,270
product that works with token
uh

64
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
uh
 

65
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,069
uh
probably will start

66
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
probably will start
 

67
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,630
probably will start
tomorrow this whole process

68
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
tomorrow this whole process
 

69
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,710
tomorrow this whole process
and i hope we will finish it's uh on

70
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:44,720
and i hope we will finish it's uh on
 

71

works fine
 

77
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,550
works fine
so uh basically uh we will update the

78
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
so uh basically uh we will update the
 

79
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,910
so uh basically uh we will update the
bridge uh it means that uh

80
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920
bridge uh it means that uh
 

81
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,030
bridge uh it means that uh
uh yeah so

82
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
uh yeah so
 

83
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,069
uh yeah so
few words about the bridge uh

84
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
few words about the bridge uh
 

85
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,870
few words about the bridge uh
it will be relaunched from the genesis

86
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
it will be relaunched from the genesis
 

87
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,949
it will be relaunched from the genesis
you know uh so uh every single contract

88
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
you know uh so uh every single contract
 

89
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,790
you know uh so uh every single contract
will be redeployed

90
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
will be redeployed
 

91
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,309
will be redeployed
uh will have like new token contracts a

92
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
uh will have like new token contracts a
 

93
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,830
uh will have like new token contracts a
new bridge specific contracts and uh so

94
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840
new bridge specific contracts and uh so
 

95
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,630
new bridge specific contracts and uh so
on

96
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
on
 

97
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,390
on
uh which is uh also important we will

98
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
uh which is uh also important we will
 

99
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,190
uh which is uh also important we will
publish the instruction for for example

100
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
publish the instruction for for example
 

101
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,710
publish the instruction for for example
for our release what they uh should do

102
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
for our release what they uh should do
 

103

it's not a
 

109
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,229
it's not a
complex process you know it's just a few

110
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
complex process you know it's just a few
 

111
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,150
complex process you know it's just a few
few comments but uh our bridge release

112
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160
few comments but uh our bridge release
 

113
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,390
few comments but uh our bridge release
needs to support it

114
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
needs to support it
 

115
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,030
needs to support it
for a regular user you know like a token

116
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
for a regular user you know like a token
 

117

and uh your token update will

130
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
and uh your token update will
 

131
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,589
and uh your token update will

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,149
uh
will be like automatic you know so you

134
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
will be like automatic you know so you
 

135
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,710
will be like automatic you know so you
will just detect if you have uh old

136
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
will just detect if you have uh old
 

137
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,430
will just detect if you have uh old
version tokens and uh since you have it

138
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
version tokens and uh since you have it
 

139
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,910

in your crystal wallet and your old uh

144
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
in your crystal wallet and your old uh
 

145
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,229
in your crystal wallet and your old uh
let's say use the t will be burned and

146
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
let's say use the t will be burned and
 

147
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,110
let's say use the t will be burned and
the new one will will be minted to you

148
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
the new one will will be minted to you
 

149
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,030
the new one will will be minted to you
that's it you know so for

150
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040
that's it you know so for
 

151
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,589
that's it you know so for
a like regular user it's kind of kind of

152
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
a like regular user it's kind of kind of
 

153
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,589
a like regular user it's kind of kind of
simple process

154
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
simple process
 

155
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,670
simple process
another important thing is the farming

156
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
another important thing is the farming
 

157
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,030
another important thing is the farming
when we

158
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
when we
 

159
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,070
when we
made a farming like a half year ago

160
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
made a farming like a half year ago
 

161
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,830
made a farming like a half year ago
we made it especially uh unupdatable and

162
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
we made it especially uh unupdatable and
 

163
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,309
we made it especially uh unupdatable and
upgradable you know so the current

164
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
upgradable you know so the current
 

165
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,030
upgradable you know so the current
version of the farming let's say can be

166
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
version of the farming let's say can be
 

167
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,110
version of the farming let's say can be
stopped immediately okay uh so uh

168
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
stopped immediately okay uh so uh
 

169
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,149
stopped immediately okay uh so uh
what we're gonna do we will set the uh

170
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
what we're gonna do we will set the uh
 

171
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,630
what we're gonna do we will set the uh
reward speed to zero

172
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
reward speed to zero
 

173
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,350
reward speed to zero
so there will be no uh new rewards in

174
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
so there will be no uh new rewards in
 

175
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,789
so there will be no uh new rewards in
the current farming

176
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
the current farming
 

177
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,670
the current farming
let's call it like old farming and uh

178
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
let's call it like old farming and uh
 

179
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,149
let's call it like old farming and uh
after that uh

180
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159
after that uh
 

181
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,149
after that uh
there is a duration as i remember like

182
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
there is a duration as i remember like
 

183
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,589
there is a duration as i remember like
four months or half a year maybe uh into

184
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
four months or half a year maybe uh into
 

185
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,589
four months or half a year maybe uh into
this uh rewards

186
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
this uh rewards
 

187
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,509
this uh rewards
you know like your current reward will

188
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
you know like your current reward will
 

189
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,430
you know like your current reward will
be vested to you

190
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
be vested to you
 

191
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,189
be vested to you
so until uh until end of this period

192
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
so until uh until end of this period
 

193
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,070
so until uh until end of this period
you have to uh you know wait until it

194
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
you have to uh you know wait until it
 

195
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,830
you have to uh you know wait until it
completely unlocked

196
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
completely unlocked
 

197
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,790
completely unlocked
take it

198
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
take it
 

199
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,110
take it
they they will be released to you in the

200
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
they they will be released to you in the
 

201
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,469
they they will be released to you in the
old uh tokens you will update it as i

202
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
old uh tokens you will update it as i
 

203
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,670
old uh tokens you will update it as i
said to the new tokens and

204
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
said to the new tokens and
 

205
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,150
said to the new tokens and
that's it we also will launch the new

206
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
that's it we also will launch the new
 

207
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,430
that's it we also will launch the new
farming instance with new pools so

208
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
farming instance with new pools so
 

209
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,510
farming instance with new pools so
there is no problem for you to

210
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
there is no problem for you to
 

211
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,870
there is no problem for you to
uh right after the update take out your

212
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
uh right after the update take out your
 

213
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,510
uh right after the update take out your
liquidity from the current farming and

214
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
liquidity from the current farming and
 

215
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,230
liquidity from the current farming and
uh deposit it to the new one

216
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
uh deposit it to the new one
 

217
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,950
uh deposit it to the new one
uh so so yeah uh the farming also will

218
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
uh so so yeah uh the farming also will
 

219
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,629
uh so so yeah uh the farming also will
be updated it's like first priority

220
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
be updated it's like first priority
 

221
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,029
be updated it's like first priority
another thing is our decks

222
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
another thing is our decks
 

223
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,430
another thing is our decks
uh since you know it works with tokens

224
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
uh since you know it works with tokens
 

225
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,830
uh since you know it works with tokens
it also needs to be updated

226
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
it also needs to be updated
 

227
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,270
it also needs to be updated
uh

228
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
uh
 

229
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,029
uh
probably uh i i hope we will uh also

230
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
probably uh i i hope we will uh also
 

231
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,270
probably uh i i hope we will uh also
finish it until tuesday

232
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
finish it until tuesday
 

233
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,749
finish it until tuesday
uh

234
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759

 

235
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,029

so

236
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
so
 

237
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,350
so
the instruction for the users who have

238
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
the instruction for the users who have
 

239
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,990
the instruction for the users who have
like uh you know liquidity position uh

240
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
like uh you know liquidity position uh
 

241
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,629
like uh you know liquidity position uh
in some pools uh will be released

242
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
in some pools uh will be released
 

243
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,830
in some pools uh will be released
probably it will won't also be a complex

244
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,840
probably it will won't also be a complex
 

245
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,029
probably it will won't also be a complex
process uh you just need to press a few

246
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
process uh you just need to press a few
 

247
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,590
process uh you just need to press a few
buttons probably send a few cheap error

248
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
buttons probably send a few cheap error
 

249
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,029
buttons probably send a few cheap error
scale transactions and that's it so yeah

250
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
scale transactions and that's it so yeah
 

251
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,390
scale transactions and that's it so yeah
uh

252
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
uh
 

253
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,629
uh
well uh what is a

254
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
well uh what is a
 

255
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,670
well uh what is a
few words about the new token standard

256
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
few words about the new token standard
 

257
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,110
few words about the new token standard
um

258
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
um
 

259
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,150
um
first of all why it was uh made

260
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
first of all why it was uh made
 

261
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,870
first of all why it was uh made
because we had an old token standard for

262
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
because we had an old token standard for
 

263
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,629
because we had an old token standard for
a year probably and it works just fine

264
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
a year probably and it works just fine
 

265
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,790
a year probably and it works just fine
there is there are a few reasons first

266
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
there is there are a few reasons first
 

267
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,469
there is there are a few reasons first
of all there are a few like uh

268
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
of all there are a few like uh
 

269
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,029
of all there are a few like uh
minor security issues

270
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
minor security issues
 

271
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,790
minor security issues
uh they are

272
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
uh they are
 

273
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,749
uh they are
uh

274
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
uh
 

275
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,950
uh
they they are not lead to the uh steal

276
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
they they are not lead to the uh steal
 

277
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,230
they they are not lead to the uh steal
of uh

278
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
of uh
 

279
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,550
of uh
funds you know you can't lose your funds

280
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
funds you know you can't lose your funds
 

281
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,909
funds you know you can't lose your funds
but uh they can lead to some kind of

282
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
but uh they can lead to some kind of
 

283
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,469
but uh they can lead to some kind of
denial of service attacks you know when

284
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
denial of service attacks you know when
 

285
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,430
denial of service attacks you know when
uh

286
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
uh
 

287
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,790
uh
some malicious actor can like block you

288
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
some malicious actor can like block you
 

289
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,029
some malicious actor can like block you
from performing operations with your

290
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,039
from performing operations with your
 

291
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:27,990
from performing operations with your
token

292
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
token
 

293
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,710
token
and

294
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
and
 

295
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,870
and
it's not really good it should be fixed

296
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
it's not really good it should be fixed
 

297
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,510
it's not really good it should be fixed
and the current version of the token are

298
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
and the current version of the token are
 

299
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,029
and the current version of the token are
also

300
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
also
 

301
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,390
also
unupgradable

302
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
unupgradable
 

303
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,350
unupgradable
so you know we can't just uh

304
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
so you know we can't just uh
 

305
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,950
so you know we can't just uh
upgrade all of them uh in uh

306
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
upgrade all of them uh in uh
 

307
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,950
upgrade all of them uh in uh
in a few in a few minutes

308
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:44,960
in a few in a few minutes
 

309
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,430
in a few in a few minutes
so we have to redeploy all the contracts

310
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
so we have to redeploy all the contracts
 

311
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,990
so we have to redeploy all the contracts
all the network all the products

312
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
all the network all the products
 

313
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,270
all the network all the products
uh another important thing is that uh

314
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
uh another important thing is that uh
 

315
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,110
uh another important thing is that uh
the last year

316
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
the last year
 

317
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,589
the last year
uh in aeroscale we didn't have like the

318
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:57,599
uh in aeroscale we didn't have like the
 

319
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,670
uh in aeroscale we didn't have like the
common token standards like you know the

320
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
common token standards like you know the
 

321
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,350
common token standards like you know the
erc20 in ethereum so every probably

322
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360
erc20 in ethereum so every probably
 

323
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,990
erc20 in ethereum so every probably
every team had uh

324
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000
every team had uh
 

325
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,110
every team had uh
their own standard like processor made

326
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
their own standard like processor made
 

327
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,710
their own standard like processor made
their uh products with their own

328
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
their uh products with their own
 

329
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,909
their uh products with their own
standards and labs use their own one and

330
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
standards and labs use their own one and
 

331
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,309
standards and labs use their own one and
so on uh we finally uh

332
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
so on uh we finally uh
 

333
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,029
so on uh we finally uh
found a consensus in our vision of a

334
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
found a consensus in our vision of a
 

335
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,390
found a consensus in our vision of a
token standard

336
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
token standard
 

337
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,029
token standard
so now uh you can see the the current uh

338
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
so now uh you can see the the current uh
 

339
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,870
so now uh you can see the the current uh
the current standard on the ever

340
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
the current standard on the ever
 

341
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,990
the current standard on the ever
everscale documentation website it is

342
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,000
everscale documentation website it is
 

343
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,510
everscale documentation website it is
already public

344
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
already public
 

345
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,070
already public
basically it will be used across all the

346
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
basically it will be used across all the
 

347
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,469
basically it will be used across all the
teams across all the products

348
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
teams across all the products
 

349
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,909
teams across all the products
so it means that uh it would uh

350
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
so it means that uh it would uh
 

351
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,189
so it means that uh it would uh
there would be some kind of

352
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
there would be some kind of
 

353
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,629
there would be some kind of
interoperability

354
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
interoperability
 

355
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,589
interoperability
between products in every scale also you

356
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
between products in every scale also you
 

357
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,469
between products in every scale also you
know every token will be supported by

358
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
know every token will be supported by
 

359
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,270
know every token will be supported by
the

360
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
the
 

361
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,909
the
let's say block explorer because for now

362
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:53,919
let's say block explorer because for now
 

363
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,990
let's say block explorer because for now
it's a kind of complex

364
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
it's a kind of complex
 

365
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,469
it's a kind of complex
process because everyone has its own

366
00:07:58,469 --> 00:07:58,479
process because everyone has its own
 

367
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,469
process because everyone has its own
token standard and uh

368
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
token standard and uh
 

369
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,510
token standard and uh
so on so yeah it was like uh

370
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
so on so yeah it was like uh
 

371
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,550
so on so yeah it was like uh
inevitable you know uh process we

372
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
inevitable you know uh process we
 

373
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,589
inevitable you know uh process we
had to have uh the common token standard

374
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
had to have uh the common token standard
 

375
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,430
had to have uh the common token standard
and finally we reached an agreement

376
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
and finally we reached an agreement
 

377
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,150
and finally we reached an agreement
about it i'm really excited

378
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
about it i'm really excited
 

379
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,830
about it i'm really excited
so yeah that's just a

380
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
so yeah that's just a
 

381
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,230
so yeah that's just a
few words about the immigration uh why

382
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
few words about the immigration uh why
 

383
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,029
few words about the immigration uh why
we should perform it also it's uh

384
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
we should perform it also it's uh
 

385
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,150
we should perform it also it's uh
uh

386
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
uh
 

387
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,270
uh
is you know we have a uh

388
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
is you know we have a uh
 

389
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,270
is you know we have a uh
wrapped tone token in uh everscale

390
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
wrapped tone token in uh everscale
 

391
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,990
wrapped tone token in uh everscale
and since we had the rebranding it

392
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000
and since we had the rebranding it
 

393
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,230
and since we had the rebranding it
should be a name to wrap ether and you

394
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
should be a name to wrap ether and you
 

395
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,389
should be a name to wrap ether and you
know it's also impossible to

396
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399
know it's also impossible to
 

397
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,829
know it's also impossible to
just we can set a new name we have to

398
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
just we can set a new name we have to
 

399
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,430
just we can set a new name we have to
update it uh

400
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
update it uh
 

401
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,470
update it uh
all over the products we have to create

402
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
all over the products we have to create
 

403
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,670
all over the products we have to create
the new token it will be called wrapped

404
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
the new token it will be called wrapped
 

405
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,509
the new token it will be called wrapped
ever probably

406
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519
ever probably
 

407
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:58,150
ever probably
uh so yeah running is another reason

408
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,160

 

409
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,310

yeah i think that it's more

410
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
yeah i think that it's more
 

411
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,470
yeah i think that it's more
it's more uh

412
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
it's more uh
 

413
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,770
it's more uh
more community

414
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:03,780
more community

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,790
we we happy to hear that uh there will
be a united uh standard for the

426
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:18,800
be a united uh standard for the
 

427
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,070
be a united uh standard for the
yeah

428
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
yeah
 

429

yeah
uh we have collected the um

432
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:24,959
uh we have collected the um
 

433
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,509
uh we have collected the um
several questions from our community

434
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
several questions from our community
 

435
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,630
several questions from our community
um

436
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
um
 

437
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,470
um
let me let me

438
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
let me let me
 

439
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,070
let me let me
read them uh

440
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,080
read them uh
 

441
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,430
read them uh
what's new in this migration and why do

442
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
what's new in this migration and why do
 

443
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,430
what's new in this migration and why do
we need this

444
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440
we need this
 

445
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,949
we need this
um

446

um
 

447
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,750
um
i think that we already explained it

448
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
i think that we already explained it
 

449
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,670
i think that we already explained it
yeah yeah probably we need a similar uh

450

yeah yeah probably we need a similar uh
 

451
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,470
yeah yeah probably we need a similar uh
standard as a rc20

and uh it's support for the new tokens

516
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
and uh it's support for the new tokens
 

517
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,949
and uh it's support for the new tokens
uh

518
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,959
uh
 

519
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,590
uh
probably i'm not sure because you know

520
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
probably i'm not sure because you know
 

521
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,990
probably i'm not sure because you know
i'm not

522
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000

 

523
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,190

a developer

524
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
a developer
 

525
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,949
a developer
of the surf wallet

526
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
of the surf wallet
 

527
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:19,829
of the surf wallet
uh

528
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
uh
 

529
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,470
uh
what are their exact plan

530
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
what are their exact plan
 

531
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,990
what are their exact plan
but uh

532
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
but uh
 

533
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,910
but uh
tom laps uh also uh participated uh i

534
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:27,920
tom laps uh also uh participated uh i
 

535
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,949
tom laps uh also uh participated uh i
think that uh thank them very much uh in

536
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959
think that uh thank them very much uh in
 

537
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,150
think that uh thank them very much uh in
uh the

538
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
uh the
 

539
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,870
uh the
development of this token standard so

540
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
development of this token standard so
 

541
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,590
development of this token standard so
yeah probably in some form it will be

542
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
yeah probably in some form it will be
 

543
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,190
yeah probably in some form it will be
supported in uh the uh surf wallet as i

544
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
supported in uh the uh surf wallet as i
 

545
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,030
supported in uh the uh surf wallet as i
know uh there is uh you know uh

546
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
know uh there is uh you know uh
 

547
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,590
know uh there is uh you know uh
probability that the

548
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600
probability that the
 

549
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,949
probability that the
uh exact implementation of the token

550
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
uh exact implementation of the token
 

551
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:51,910
uh exact implementation of the token
wallet

552
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
wallet
 

553
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,389
wallet
uh will be different between you know

554
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
uh will be different between you know
 

555
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,550
uh will be different between you know
like broxas products and certain labs

556
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
like broxas products and certain labs
 

557
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,310
like broxas products and certain labs
products like flex decks and so on

558
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
products like flex decks and so on
 

559
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,069
products like flex decks and so on
uh the current standard is not about the

560
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
uh the current standard is not about the
 

561
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,150
uh the current standard is not about the
exact implementation

562
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
exact implementation
 

563
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,550
exact implementation
but about some core

564
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:08,560
but about some core
 

565
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,389
but about some core
architecture patterns

566
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
architecture patterns
 

567
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,310
architecture patterns
some uh core function names and so on so

568
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
some uh core function names and so on so
 

569
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,829
some uh core function names and so on so
yeah

570
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
yeah
 

571
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,829
yeah
you know uh i think that

572
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
you know uh i think that
 

573
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,590
you know uh i think that
let's say the

574
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
let's say the
 

575
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,710
let's say the
uh

576
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:20,720
uh
 

577
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,190
uh
tokens which will be supported in uh

578
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
tokens which will be supported in uh
 

579
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,790
tokens which will be supported in uh
crystal wallet

580
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:26,800
crystal wallet
 

581
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,790
crystal wallet
probably will be supported in surf

582
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:28,800
probably will be supported in surf
 

583
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,870
probably will be supported in surf
wallet too

584
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880
wallet too
 

585
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,430
wallet too
cool cool

586
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
cool cool
 

587
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,269
cool cool
uh the next question is um

588
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:37,279
uh the next question is um
 

589
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,509
uh the next question is um
can it might be repeated in the near

590
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
can it might be repeated in the near
 

591
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,710
can it might be repeated in the near
future uh he mean about the

592
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
future uh he mean about the
 

593
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,910
future uh he mean about the
immigration

594
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:43,920
immigration
 

595
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,269
immigration
operation

596
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279
operation
 

597
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,190
operation
yeah yeah yeah that's that's a good

598
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
yeah yeah yeah that's that's a good
 

599
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,310
yeah yeah yeah that's that's a good
question yeah uh i hope that

600
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
question yeah uh i hope that
 

601
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,590
question yeah uh i hope that
we won't need it for a long time

602
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
we won't need it for a long time
 

603
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,269
we won't need it for a long time
um the new migration uh you know for

604
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279
um the new migration uh you know for
 

605
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,870
um the new migration uh you know for
example as i said

606
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:58,880
example as i said
 

607
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,470
example as i said
we

608
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
we
 

609
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,629
we
have used the non-upgradable tokens

610
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
have used the non-upgradable tokens
 

611
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,590
have used the non-upgradable tokens
and the new version is upgradable

612
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
and the new version is upgradable
 

613
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,389
and the new version is upgradable
so

614
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
so
 

615
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,190
so
if anything goes wrong yes there are

616
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
if anything goes wrong yes there are
 

617
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,910
if anything goes wrong yes there are
also some security uh

618
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
also some security uh
 

619
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,949
also some security uh
bug or something else at least we can

620
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:16,959
bug or something else at least we can
 

621
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,870
bug or something else at least we can
update the

622
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:18,880
update the
 

623
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,150
update the
implementation of the token wallets and

624
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
implementation of the token wallets and
 

625
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,110
implementation of the token wallets and
uh you know it doesn't affect other pro

626
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,120
uh you know it doesn't affect other pro
 

627
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,030
uh you know it doesn't affect other pro
products we don't need to redeploy

628
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
products we don't need to redeploy
 

629
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,550
products we don't need to redeploy
bridge and so on

630
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
bridge and so on
 

631
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,829
bridge and so on
and uh

632
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:29,839
and uh
 

633
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,670
and uh
which is also important so we uh made it

634
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:33,680
which is also important so we uh made it
 

635
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,710
which is also important so we uh made it
uh like um

636
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
uh like um
 

637
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,829
uh like um
the current token wallet can be updated

638
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
the current token wallet can be updated
 

639
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,590
the current token wallet can be updated
without the

640
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,600
without the
 

641
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,990
without the
agreement from the owner you know you

642
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000
agreement from the owner you know you
 

643
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,350
agreement from the owner you know you
you have to uh confirm that okay you're

644
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
you have to uh confirm that okay you're
 

645
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,069
you have to uh confirm that okay you're
ready to update your token wallet i

646
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,079
ready to update your token wallet i
 

647
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,870
ready to update your token wallet i
think it's also an amazing feature it's

648
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:52,880
think it's also an amazing feature it's
 

649
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,269
think it's also an amazing feature it's
about decentralizing

650
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
about decentralizing
 

651
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,110
about decentralizing
and like the uh

652
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
and like the uh
 

653
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,750
and like the uh
community governance of this uh whole

654

691
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,389
question is uh
will integration of uh selectors provide

692
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:48,399
will integration of uh selectors provide
 

693
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,710
will integration of uh selectors provide
uh any new possibilities for

694
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
uh any new possibilities for
 

695
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,509
uh any new possibilities for
for smart contracts uh developers or is

696
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
for smart contracts uh developers or is
 

697
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,750
for smart contracts uh developers or is
it just something for off-chain

698
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
it just something for off-chain
 

699
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,230
it just something for off-chain
developers

700
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
developers
 

701
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,269
developers
uh

702
00:14:59,269 --> 00:14:59,279
uh
 

703
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,710
uh
well uh

704
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:04,720

 

705
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,470

the internal logic of the smart contract

706
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
the internal logic of the smart contract
 

707
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,670
the internal logic of the smart contract
it's about support them yeah let's say

708
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:11,680
it's about support them yeah let's say
 

709
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,550
it's about support them yeah let's say
block explorers you can support any

710
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
block explorers you can support any
 

711
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,030
block explorers you can support any
token which

712
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040
token which
 

713
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,069
token which
supports these function ids

714
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:20,079
supports these function ids
 

715
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,030
supports these function ids
so

716
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
so
 

717
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,230
so
i'm not sure about the new possibilities

718
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
i'm not sure about the new possibilities
 

719
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,269
i'm not sure about the new possibilities
for you know on chain usage and also

720
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:27,279
for you know on chain usage and also
 

721
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,470
for you know on chain usage and also
there are a few improvements in uh like

722
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:30,480
there are a few improvements in uh like
 

723
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,949
there are a few improvements in uh like
uh the boxes implementation of the

724
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:32,959
uh the boxes implementation of the
 

725
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,150
uh the boxes implementation of the
tokens for example uh as i remember uh

726
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
tokens for example uh as i remember uh
 

727
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,590
tokens for example uh as i remember uh
there was no uh callback on the mint

728
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600
there was no uh callback on the mint
 

729
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,629
there was no uh callback on the mint
event

730
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
event
 

731
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,990
event
and you know it was tough to integrate

732
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,000
and you know it was tough to integrate
 

733
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,430
and you know it was tough to integrate
all the means oriented uh

734
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
all the means oriented uh
 

735
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,069
all the means oriented uh
process in your decentralized

736
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
process in your decentralized
 

737
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,189
process in your decentralized
application

738
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
application
 

739
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,470
application
now it is uh way more easy to do

740
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:54,480
now it is uh way more easy to do
 

741
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,550
now it is uh way more easy to do
you can just you know react

742
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
you can just you know react
 

743
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,590
you can just you know react
every time someone means here a token

744
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,600
every time someone means here a token
 

745
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,110
every time someone means here a token
and uh

746
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,120
and uh
 

747
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,030
and uh
so the the i forgot about this point uh

748
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,040
so the the i forgot about this point uh
 

749
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,629
so the the i forgot about this point uh
also like the on chain usage is a little

750
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
also like the on chain usage is a little
 

751
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,430
also like the on chain usage is a little
bit

752
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:09,440
bit
 

753
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,350
bit
improved

754
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
improved
 

755
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,430
improved
the function id is maybe it

756
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
the function id is maybe it
 

757
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,870
the function id is maybe it
it don't affect the on chain so much

758
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:20,880

 

759
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,389

on next question is uh

760
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:24,399
on next question is uh
 

761
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,670
on next question is uh
are there any plans uh on adding uh

762
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
are there any plans uh on adding uh
 

763
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,710
are there any plans uh on adding uh

00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:51,440
few days the new information basically
 

865
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,590
few days the new information basically
will need uh to finish the

866
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:55,600
will need uh to finish the
 

867
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,710
will need uh to finish the
migration and after this uh

868
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:58,720
migration and after this uh
 

869
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,270
migration and after this uh
the new farming pools will just be

870
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:01,280
the new farming pools will just be
 

871
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,230
the new farming pools will just be
launched

872
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,240
launched
 

873
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,870
launched
as soon as possible

874
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:04,880
as soon as possible
 

875
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,950
as soon as possible
maybe it will still stay the same i'm

876
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:06,960
maybe it will still stay the same i'm
 

877
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,470
maybe it will still stay the same i'm
not sure

878
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:10,480

 

879
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,750

uh could you provide us uh

880
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
uh could you provide us uh
 

881
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,789
uh could you provide us uh
this uh the your token uh registry

882
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
this uh the your token uh registry
 

883
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:17,830
this uh the your token uh registry
please

884
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:17,840
please
 

885
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,830
please
how uh we could add our tokens there

886
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:22,840

 

887
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,390

uh let me see the question uh you mean

888
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,400
uh let me see the question uh you mean
 

889
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,590
uh let me see the question uh you mean
uh

890
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:27,600
uh
 

891
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,310
uh
uh did give me a moment let me send it

892
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,320
uh did give me a moment let me send it
 

893
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,669
uh did give me a moment let me send it
to you

894
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:31,679
to you
 

895
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,789
to you
okay yeah i see uh if uh

896
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:34,799
okay yeah i see uh if uh
 

897
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,549
okay yeah i see uh if uh
if you mean the token registry like the

898
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
if you mean the token registry like the
 

899
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,510
if you mean the token registry like the
white list for tokens

900
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:41,520
white list for tokens
 

901
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,549
white list for tokens
so

902
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559
so
 

903
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,029
so
this white list is located on the github

904
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,039
this white list is located on the github
 

905
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,310
this white list is located on the github
and

906
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:48,320
and
 

907
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,789
and
i think you can make a full request to

908
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
i think you can make a full request to
 

909
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,150
i think you can make a full request to
it and probably it will be

910
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160
it and probably it will be
 

911
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,230
it and probably it will be
accepted there are still no you know

912
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240
accepted there are still no you know
 

913
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,510
accepted there are still no you know
like politics about accepting new tokens

914
00:19:59,510 --> 00:19:59,520
like politics about accepting new tokens
 

915
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,470
like politics about accepting new tokens
in this white list probably we will

916
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
in this white list probably we will
 

917
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,870
in this white list probably we will
upgrade our interfaces

918
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:04,880
upgrade our interfaces
 

919
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,110
upgrade our interfaces
uh to support

920
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,120
uh to support
 

921
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,710
uh to support
uh like

922
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
uh like
 

923
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,350
uh like
user defined white lists

924
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,360
user defined white lists
 

925
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,310
user defined white lists
uh

926
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,320
uh
 

927
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,350
uh
but uh but you you can try just to make

928
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
but uh but you you can try just to make
 

929
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,710
but uh but you you can try just to make
a pull request

00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720

 

931
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,430

it's uh in their boxes organization this

932
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,440
it's uh in their boxes organization this
 

933
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,710
it's uh in their boxes organization this
repo with

repo with
 

935
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,370
repo with
a token list

936
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:25,380

uh
 

941
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,750
uh
it it became a difficult uh practice to

942
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:31,760
it it became a difficult uh practice to
 

943
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,830
it it became a difficult uh practice to
use uh tom wallet plus play out for tip

944
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:35,840
use uh tom wallet plus play out for tip
 

945
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,310
use uh tom wallet plus play out for tip
three operations instead of external

946
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320
three operations instead of external
 

947
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,350
three operations instead of external
call which calls tip three wallet

948
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,360
call which calls tip three wallet
 

949
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,470
call which calls tip three wallet
directly

950
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
directly
 

951
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,110
directly
via private key

952
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120

 

953
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:54,710

let me see

954
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:54,720

 

955
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,789

uh i'm not sure that it's uh

956
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799

 

957
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,110

okay i see it became default practice to

958
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,120
okay i see it became default practice to
 

959
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,830
okay i see it became default practice to
use some wallet plus plus payload

960
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:03,840
use some wallet plus plus payload
 

961
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,470
use some wallet plus plus payload
instead of external call yes uh right

962
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:08,480
instead of external call yes uh right
 

963
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,750
instead of external call yes uh right
in our

964
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:09,760
in our
 

965
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,870
in our
uh

966
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:10,880
uh
 

967
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,029
uh
current implementation it's like the

968
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
current implementation it's like the
 

969
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,070
current implementation it's like the
only way to use the token it's called

970
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,080
only way to use the token it's called
 

971
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,750
only way to use the token it's called
like internal call so you you have to

972
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:19,760
like internal call so you you have to
 

973
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,510
like internal call so you you have to
use your basic accounts like uh your

974
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:23,520
use your basic accounts like uh your
 

975
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,390
use your basic accounts like uh your
uh

976
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400
uh
 

977
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,190
uh
wallet to initialize the call to your

978
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200
wallet to initialize the call to your
 

979
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,630
wallet to initialize the call to your
token wallet

980
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
token wallet
 

981
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,789
token wallet
so uh

982
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:30,799
so uh
 

983
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,750
so uh
in the in the previous implementation uh

984
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:33,760
in the in the previous implementation uh
 

985
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,270
in the in the previous implementation uh
it was implemented but uh as i remember

986
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,280
it was implemented but uh as i remember
 

987
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,270
it was implemented but uh as i remember
uh it's uh

988
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:39,280
uh it's uh
 

989
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,669
uh it's uh
never uh never used

990
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:41,679
never uh never used
 

991
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,950
never uh never used
at least once um the

992
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:44,960
at least once um the
 

993
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,909
at least once um the
whole it is also important to say that

994
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
whole it is also important to say that
 

995
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,470
whole it is also important to say that
the whole standard the tip three it uh

996
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,480
the whole standard the tip three it uh
 

997
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,350
the whole standard the tip three it uh
does not tell you which way of uh

998
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:55,360
does not tell you which way of uh
 

999
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,549
does not tell you which way of uh
ownership you should use you know

1000
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:58,559
ownership you should use you know
 

1001
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,110
ownership you should use you know
it's like that doesn't care about it so

1002
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,120
it's like that doesn't care about it so
 

1003
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,390
it's like that doesn't care about it so
our token implementation uses the

1004
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,400
our token implementation uses the
 

1005
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,190
our token implementation uses the
internal ownership and uh you know

1006
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,200
internal ownership and uh you know
 

1007
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,590
internal ownership and uh you know
anyone if

1008
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:09,600
anyone if
 

1009
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,270
anyone if
if there is a need

1010
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
if there is a need
 

1011
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,990
if there is a need
can create a new token implementation

1012
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,000
can create a new token implementation
 

1013
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,549
can create a new token implementation
with extra external ownership by private

1014
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:16,559
with extra external ownership by private
 

1015
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,870
with extra external ownership by private
key that's uh that's okay

1016
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:20,880

 

1017
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,750

these tokens still be uh

1018
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
these tokens still be uh
 

1019
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,270
these tokens still be uh
will be supported

1020
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,280
will be supported
 

1021
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,390
will be supported
like the

1022
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
like the
 

1023
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,190
like the
block explorer for example

1024
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,200
block explorer for example
 

1025
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,190
block explorer for example
you will see the token transfers and so

1026
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,200
you will see the token transfers and so
 

1027
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,750
you will see the token transfers and so
on

1028
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:33,760

 

1029
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,950

uh next question is uh what

1030
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
uh next question is uh what
 

1031
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,430
uh next question is uh what
are your comments on the standard

1032
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
are your comments on the standard
 

1033
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,230
are your comments on the standard
interface for default functions like

1034
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
interface for default functions like
 

1035
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,029
interface for default functions like
transfer are not strictly

1036
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:45,039
transfer are not strictly
 

1037
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:52,830
transfer are not strictly
defined and behavior is not defined

1038
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:52,840

 

1039
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,990

well uh

1040
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,000
well uh
 

1041
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,510
well uh
i can't agree that the behavior is not

1042
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
i can't agree that the behavior is not
 

1043
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,710
i can't agree that the behavior is not
defined

1044
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
defined
 

1045
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,549
defined
uh the

1046
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:00,559
uh the
 

1047
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,669
uh the
idea about the current standard

1048
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:03,679
idea about the current standard
 

1049
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,430
idea about the current standard
is that it implements like you know uh

1050
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:07,440
is that it implements like you know uh
 

1051
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,029
is that it implements like you know uh
basic functionality for detecting their

1052
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:11,039
basic functionality for detecting their
 

1053
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,950
basic functionality for detecting their
transfers or mint

1054
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:12,960
transfers or mint
 

1055
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,950
transfers or mint
or burn operations

1056
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:14,960
or burn operations
 

1057
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,990
or burn operations
the

1058
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
the
 

1059
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,750
the
external method

1060
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:17,760
external method
 

1061
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,470
external method
for example for initializing the

00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,480
for example for initializing the
 

1063
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,230
for example for initializing the
transfer can be different uh it

1064
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,240
transfer can be different uh it
 

1065
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,110
transfer can be different uh it
can

1066
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,120
can
 

1067
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,149
can
depend

00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
depend
 

1069
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,350

00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,360
on the
 

1071
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,070
on the
uh implementation yeah as as i said for

1072
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,080
uh implementation yeah as as i said for
 

1073
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,950
uh implementation yeah as as i said for
example you can have two different uh

1074
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:32,960
example you can have two different uh
 

1075
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,149
example you can have two different uh
sub standards like the internal owned

1076
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:36,159
sub standards like the internal owned
 

1077
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,029
sub standards like the internal owned
token wallet and external on stock in

1078
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:39,039
token wallet and external on stock in
 

1079
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,390
token wallet and external on stock in
the wallet this uh

1080
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:42,400
the wallet this uh
 

1081
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,789
the wallet this uh
this uh

1082
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:44,799
this uh
 

1083
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,990
this uh
method for initializing the transfer

1084
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,000
method for initializing the transfer
 

1085
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,110
method for initializing the transfer
uh

1086
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,120
uh
 

1087
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,590
uh
can't be the same you know between these

1088
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:51,600
can't be the same you know between these
 

1089
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,990
can't be the same you know between these
two standards because uh external

1090
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000
two standards because uh external
 

1091
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,110
two standards because uh external
ownership and internal ownership works

1092
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,120
ownership and internal ownership works
 

1093
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,710
ownership and internal ownership works
uh a little bit

1094
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:58,720
uh a little bit
 

1095
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,750
uh a little bit
different

1096
00:23:59,750 --> 00:23:59,760
different
 

1097
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,070
different
uh so uh

1098
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,080
uh so uh
 

1099
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,950
uh so uh
the

1100
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
the
 

1101
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,430
the
uh which is also more important here i

1102
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,440
uh which is also more important here i
 

1103
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,269
uh which is also more important here i
forgot to say about it that we will

1104
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:07,279
forgot to say about it that we will
 

1105
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,149
forgot to say about it that we will
release the so-called substandard let's

1106
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:10,159
release the so-called substandard let's
 

1107
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,950
release the so-called substandard let's
say tip 3.1 or maybe i'm not sure to 3.2

1108
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:14,960
say tip 3.1 or maybe i'm not sure to 3.2
 

1109
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,870
say tip 3.1 or maybe i'm not sure to 3.2
with exactly our current implementation

1110
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:18,880
with exactly our current implementation
 

1111
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,110
with exactly our current implementation
like the internal ownership the uh

1112
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,120
like the internal ownership the uh
 

1113
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,549
like the internal ownership the uh
external uh interface for initializing

1114
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:26,559
external uh interface for initializing
 

1115
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,230
external uh interface for initializing
transfers and mint and burn and so on so

1116
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,240
transfers and mint and burn and so on so
 

1117
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,430
transfers and mint and burn and so on so
this substandard will define the

1118
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:33,440
this substandard will define the
 

1119
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,750
this substandard will define the
behavior as much as possible

1120
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:35,760
behavior as much as possible
 

1121
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,909
behavior as much as possible
and uh

1122
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:37,919
and uh
 

1123
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,710
and uh
and it will still be compatible with the

1124
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:40,720
and it will still be compatible with the
 

1125
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,149
and it will still be compatible with the
general tip 3 standard

1126
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:46,159

 

1127
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,710

uh when uh will the documentation be

1128
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:48,720
uh when uh will the documentation be
 

1129
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,870
uh when uh will the documentation be

like the
 

1141
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,470
like the

i'm not sure what
 

1153
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,190
i'm not sure what
i think he meant he meant this yeah i

1154
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200
i think he meant he meant this yeah i
 

1155
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,029
i think he meant he meant this yeah i
agree that's he meant this okay

1156
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:21,039
agree that's he meant this okay
 

1157
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,149
agree that's he meant this okay

1182
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
standards
 

1183
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,669
standards
standard uh supports the

1184
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:05,679
standard uh supports the
 

1185
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,549
standard uh supports the
uh like arbitrary payloads

1186
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:08,559
uh like arbitrary payloads
 

1187
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:09,510
uh like arbitrary payloads
the

1188
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:09,520
the
 

1189
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,549
the
callbacks and so on so

1190
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:12,559
callbacks and so on so
 

1191
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,110
callbacks and so on so
you can see for example the

1192
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,120
you can see for example the
 

1193
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,190
you can see for example the
the example on the

1194
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,200
the example on the
 

1195
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,830
the example on the
uh bridge smart contracts

1196
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:19,840
uh bridge smart contracts
 

1197
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,110
uh bridge smart contracts
uh there are like uh this is a specific

1198
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,120
uh there are like uh this is a specific
 

1199
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,990
uh there are like uh this is a specific
payload encoded and passed to a token

1200
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,000
payload encoded and passed to a token
 

1201
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,510
payload encoded and passed to a token
transfer and then uh after the transfer

1202
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:29,520
transfer and then uh after the transfer
 

1203
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,950
transfer and then uh after the transfer
is received

1204
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
is received
 

1205
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,990
is received
the

1206
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,000
the
 

1207
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,830
the
like receive callback is initialized so

1208
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:35,840
like receive callback is initialized so
 

1209
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,190
like receive callback is initialized so
this way you can integrate tokens in

1210
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,200
this way you can integrate tokens in
 

1211
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,190
this way you can integrate tokens in
pretty much any decentralized

1212
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,200
pretty much any decentralized

uh
 

1259
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,389
uh
okay yeah great question

1260
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:40,399
okay yeah great question
 

1261
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,070
okay yeah great question
i think that

1262
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,080
i think that
 

1263
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,789
i think that
the new implementation

1264
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:44,799
the new implementation
 

1265
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,389
the new implementation
does not

1266
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:46,399
does not
 

1267
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,510
does not
decrease the amount of transactions you

1268
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:49,520
decrease the amount of transactions you
 

1269
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,470
decrease the amount of transactions you
know there is still uh internal

1270
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:52,480
know there is still uh internal
 

1271
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,909
know there is still uh internal

additional transaction from your wallet
 

1275
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,070
additional transaction from your wallet
to the token wallet and uh so on so

1276
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,080
to the token wallet and uh so on so
 

1277
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,310
to the token wallet and uh so on so
probably the new

1278
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,320
probably the new
 

1279
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,190
probably the new
architecture the new implementation uh

1280
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:09,200
architecture the new implementation uh
 

1281
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,549
architecture the new implementation uh
don't uh

1282
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:10,559
don't uh
 

1283
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,389
don't uh
don't decrease the swap time for example

1284
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:14,399
don't decrease the swap time for example
 

1285
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,590
don't decrease the swap time for example
i think it's uh on the you know like uh

1286
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:17,600
i think it's uh on the you know like uh
 

1287
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,750
i think it's uh on the you know like uh
it requires some uh network uh changes

1288
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:21,760
it requires some uh network uh changes
 

1289
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,350
it requires some uh network uh changes
to

1290
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,360
to
 

1291
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,909
to
uh m to make this uh

1292
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:25,919
uh m to make this uh
 

1293
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:32,789
uh m to make this uh
like for example swap time less

1294
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:32,799

 

1295
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,110

on next question uh

1296
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,120
on next question uh
 

1297
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,990
on next question uh

then what

1308
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:51,600
then what
 

1309
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,070
then what
will the change of the standard give

1310
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,080
will the change of the standard give
 

1311
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,549
will the change of the standard give

uh also a good question first of all i

1314
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:02,320
uh also a good question first of all i
 

1315
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,389
uh also a good question first of all i
i'm not agree that

1316
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:04,399
i'm not agree that
 

1317
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:10,070
i'm not agree that
there are no other complex applications

1318

00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:37,520
simple
 

1389
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,870
simple
simple principle

1390
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:38,880
simple principle
 

1391
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,909
simple principle
that uh the token wallets

1392
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:41,919
that uh the token wallets
 

1393
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,909
that uh the token wallets
uh can exchange uh messages only in case

1394
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:45,919
uh can exchange uh messages only in case
 

1395
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,110
uh can exchange uh messages only in case
uh they have the same code hash so yeah

1396
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,120
uh they have the same code hash so yeah
 

1397
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,470
uh they have the same code hash so yeah
basically it's like uh

1398
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:52,480
basically it's like uh
 

1399
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,630
basically it's like uh
the main rule of the whole token

1400
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:54,640
the main rule of the whole token
 

1401
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,430
the main rule of the whole token
architecture

1402
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:57,440

 

1403
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,669

uh how to see uh what the ever tokens

1404
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:01,679
uh how to see uh what the ever tokens
 

1405
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,870
uh how to see uh what the ever tokens
locked in the bridge are invested in

1406
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:04,880
locked in the bridge are invested in
 

1407
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,750
locked in the bridge are invested in
because there are no or achieved not uh

1408
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:07,760
because there are no or achieved not uh
 

1409
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,110
because there are no or achieved not uh
in everscale to make such requests

in everscale to make such requests
 

1411
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,470
in everscale to make such requests
uh will the new standard help investors

1412
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:14,480
uh will the new standard help investors
 

1413
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,830
uh will the new standard help investors
visit

00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:42,480
how much tokens are delegated
 

1431
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,190
how much tokens are delegated
to every strategy on the uh ethereum

00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:47,200
to every strategy on the uh ethereum
 

1433
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,389
to every strategy on the uh ethereum
side uh you can just uh you know since

the vault and the strategies are open
 

1437
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,470
the vault and the strategies are open
source you can just uh verify how many

1438
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:56,480
source you can just uh verify how many
 

1439
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,110

in in every connected strategy uh i

1442
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:02,559
in in every connected strategy uh i
 

1443
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,710
in in every connected strategy uh i
don't think that so you need to like are

1444
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:04,720
don't think that so you need to like are
 

1445
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,750
don't think that so you need to like are
hypnot and you don't need to make these

1446
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:07,760
hypnot and you don't need to make these
 

1447
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,830
hypnot and you don't need to make these
checks in every scale

1448
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:09,840
checks in every scale
 

1449
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,029
checks in every scale
or just use the ethereum side

1450
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:15,039

 

1451
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,909

uh when will tone bridge will be updated

1452
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:19,919
uh when will tone bridge will be updated
 

1453
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,190
uh when will tone bridge will be updated
uh as i said uh i hope uh we will end

uh what is your price target forever

1464
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:36,880
uh what is your price target forever
 

1465
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,830
uh what is your price target forever
bridge for one year from now

1466
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:41,840

 

1467
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,549

can we just skip this question

1468
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:46,559

 

1469
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,990

yeah then

1470

yeah then
 

1471
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,310
yeah then
uh there is no financial

1472
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:50,320
uh there is no financial
 

1473
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,350
uh there is no financial
advice exactly yeah

1474
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:53,360
advice exactly yeah
 

1475
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,590
advice exactly yeah
uh could you implement automatic on

1476
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:55,600
uh could you implement automatic on
 

1477
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,789
uh could you implement automatic on
chain methods to add user are created

1478

tokens to your registry please so

1480
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:01,840
tokens to your registry please so
 

1481
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,710
tokens to your registry please so
could use their tokens inside brooks's

1482
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:04,720
could use their tokens inside brooks's
 

1483
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,909
could use their tokens inside brooks's
wallet and send them to dex

1484
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:07,919
wallet and send them to dex
 

1485
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,630
wallet and send them to dex
to sell them for example

1486
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:10,640
to sell them for example
 

1487
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,630
to sell them for example
uh it's a good question

1488
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:12,640
uh it's a good question
 

1489
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,870
uh it's a good question
let me try to ask

1490
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:14,880
let me try to ask
 

1491
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,230
let me try to ask
for example

1492
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:16,240
for example
 

1493
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,710
for example
you can remember how

1494
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:18,720
you can remember how
 

1495
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,430
you can remember how
talking lists

1496
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,440
talking lists
 

1497
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,230
talking lists
work

1498

work
 

1499
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,750
work
on the ethereum uh there is like a

1500
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:25,760
on the ethereum uh there is like a
 

1501
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,710
on the ethereum uh there is like a
standard a so-called token list uh

1502
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:28,720
standard a so-called token list uh
 

1503
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,669
standard a so-called token list uh
invented by uniswap long time ago

1504
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:31,679
invented by uniswap long time ago
 

1505
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,430
invented by uniswap long time ago
and uh there are like a lot of uh token

1506
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:35,440
and uh there are like a lot of uh token
 

1507
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,310
and uh there are like a lot of uh token

1508
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,320
lists uh across the network uh
 

1509
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,830
lists uh across the network uh
and uh like the main one uh is uh

1510
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:43,840
and uh like the main one uh is uh
 

1511
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,870
and uh like the main one uh is uh
controlled by the unis wall it's uh

kinda small you know maybe less than 100

1514
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:49,760
kinda small you know maybe less than 100

tokens
 

1517
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,190
tokens
and it's um it's important to keep it

1518
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:53,200
and it's um it's important to keep it
 

1519
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,710
and it's um it's important to keep it
small uh there is always a risk for

00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:56,720
small uh there is always a risk for
 

1521
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,269
small uh there is always a risk for
example of uh

1522
00:33:59,269 --> 00:33:59,279
example of uh
 

1523
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,430
example of uh
phishing let's say you know if i'm

1524
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:01,440
phishing let's say you know if i'm
 

1525
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,669

talking about unchain method to add user

1526
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:03,679
talking about unchain method to add user
 

1527
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,710
talking about unchain method to add user
created tokens uh what if uh

1528
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:06,720
created tokens uh what if uh
 

1529
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,430
created tokens uh what if uh
someone adds like a thousand new usdc uh

1530
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:11,440
someone adds like a thousand new usdc uh
 

1531
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,950
someone adds like a thousand new usdc uh
tokens you know

1532
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:12,960
tokens you know
 

1533
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,109
tokens you know
uh it's uh

1534
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:15,119
uh it's uh
 

1535
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,950
uh it's uh
we will have a

1536
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:16,960
we will have a
 

1537
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,669
we will have a
huge mess after that so it

1538
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:19,679
huge mess after that so it
 

1539
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,230
huge mess after that so it
this process always

1540
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:22,240
this process always
 

1541
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,790
this process always
requires some manual checks you know

1542
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:24,800
requires some manual checks you know
 

1543
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,710
requires some manual checks you know
some security checks

1544
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:26,720
some security checks
 

1545
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,190
some security checks
i'm not sure that it

1546
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,200
i'm not sure that it
 

1547
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,869
i'm not sure that it
can be done completely automatic

1548
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:32,879
can be done completely automatic
 

1549
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,389
can be done completely automatic
so probably for now uh this process will

1550
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:36,399
so probably for now uh this process will
 

1551
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,149
so probably for now uh this process will
remain the same

1552
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:38,159
remain the same
 

1553
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,510
remain the same
uh and if you want to add your token

1554
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:41,520
uh and if you want to add your token
 

1555
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,550
uh and if you want to add your token
uh

1556
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:42,560
uh

pull request
 

1561
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,430
pull request
and uh wait until it confirmed

1562

1571
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,790
uh there are three more questions uh it
seems like uh

1572
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:04,800
seems like uh
 

1573

seems like uh
you're going to update the breach and

1574
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:07,119
you're going to update the breach and
 

1575
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,109
you're going to update the breach and
token first and only then uh the new

1576
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:11,119
token first and only then uh the new
 

1577
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,310
token first and only then uh the new
uh

1578
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:12,320
uh
 

1579
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,950
uh
dex decks yeah decks

1580
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:16,960

 

1581
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,589

uh okay uh yeah yeah

1582
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:19,599
uh okay uh yeah yeah
 

1583
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,430
uh okay uh yeah yeah
i think uh

1584
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:21,440
i think uh
 

1585
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,390
i think uh
we haven't started yet but most likely

1586
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:24,400
we haven't started yet but most likely
 

1587
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,750
we haven't started yet but most likely
we'll uh make it this way like uh

1588
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:27,760
we'll uh make it this way like uh
 

1589
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,589
we'll uh make it this way like uh
the bridge and the tokens

1590
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:29,599
the bridge and the tokens
 

1591
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,670
the bridge and the tokens
it's like the

1592
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:31,680
it's like the
 

1593
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,950
it's like the
basement also for decks so yeah we have

1594
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:34,960
basement also for decks so yeah we have
 

1595
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,109
basement also for decks so yeah we have
to upgrade them uh at first

1596
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:39,119
to upgrade them uh at first
 

1597
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,670
to upgrade them uh at first
uh will there be a redeployment of the

1598
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:41,680
uh will there be a redeployment of the
 

1599
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,390
uh will there be a redeployment of the
bridge including from the ether side

1600
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:46,400
bridge including from the ether side
 

1601
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,030
bridge including from the ether side
uh yes yes uh the

1602
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,040
uh yes yes uh the
 

1603
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,390
uh yes yes uh the
uh answer uh is yes because it's

1604
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:52,400
uh answer uh is yes because it's
 

1605
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,870
uh answer uh is yes because it's
we have uh thought about

1606
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:54,880
we have uh thought about
 

1607
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,190
we have uh thought about
uh you know the redeployment without

1608
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:57,200
uh you know the redeployment without
 

1609
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,190
uh you know the redeployment without
affecting the current

1610
00:35:59,190 --> 00:35:59,200
affecting the current
 

1611
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,630
affecting the current
uh

1612
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:00,640
uh
 

1613
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,990
uh
ethereum and polygon you know and so on

1614
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,000
ethereum and polygon you know and so on
 

1615
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,870
ethereum and polygon you know and so on
uh

1616
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:04,880
uh
 

1617
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,750
uh
smart contracts and unfortunately it's

1618
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:07,760
smart contracts and unfortunately it's
 

1619
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,550
smart contracts and unfortunately it's
uh

1620
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:08,560
uh
 

1621
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,510
uh
impossible in our understanding

1622
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:11,520
impossible in our understanding
 

1623
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,870
impossible in our understanding
so yeah we will also uh upgrade

1624
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:14,880
so yeah we will also uh upgrade
 

1625
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,829
so yeah we will also uh upgrade
deploy like new instances for

1626
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:17,839
deploy like new instances for
 

1627
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,550
deploy like new instances for
every single contract that

1628
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:20,560
every single contract that
 

1629
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,510
every single contract that
exists right now

1630
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:23,520
exists right now
 

1631
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,069
exists right now
uh how will the bridge functions during

1632
00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:26,079
uh how will the bridge functions during
 

1633
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:26,790
uh how will the bridge functions during
the

1634
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:26,800
the
 

1635
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,589
the
this time and what tokens

1636
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:29,599
this time and what tokens
 

1637
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,870
this time and what tokens
versions will it support

1638
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:32,880
versions will it support
 

1639
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,750
versions will it support
uh

1640
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:33,760
uh
 

1641
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,510
uh
basically i think uh there would be some

1642
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:37,520
basically i think uh there would be some
 

1643
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,390
basically i think uh there would be some
uh

1644
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:38,400
uh
 

1645
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,390
uh
like black uh blackouts you know a few

1646
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:42,400
like black uh blackouts you know a few
 

1647
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,829
like black uh blackouts you know a few
hours i hope of uh

1648
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:47,839

 

1649
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,870

when the bridge will be disabled

1650
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:50,880
when the bridge will be disabled
 

1651
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,069
when the bridge will be disabled
we will also publish the exact uh

1652
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:54,079
we will also publish the exact uh
 

1653
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,430
we will also publish the exact uh
information

1654
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:55,440
information
 

1655
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,230
information
uh

1656
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:56,240
uh
 

1657
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,589
uh
a little bit later so uh

1658
00:36:59,589 --> 00:36:59,599
a little bit later so uh
 

1659
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,950
a little bit later so uh
after that we will try to you know

1660
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:02,960
after that we will try to you know
 

1661
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,790
after that we will try to you know
redeploy the bridge as fast as possible

1662
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:06,800
redeploy the bridge as fast as possible
 

1663
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,390
redeploy the bridge as fast as possible
it's a little a little complex because

1664
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:10,400
it's a little a little complex because
 

1665
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,190
it's a little a little complex because
uh

1666
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:11,200
uh
 

1667
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,910
uh
it

1668
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:11,920
it
 

1669
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,510
it
does not uh

1670
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:13,520
does not uh
 

1671
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,109
does not uh
depend on us only

1672
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:17,119
depend on us only
 

1673
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,030
depend on us only
also like a lot of relays

1674
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,040
also like a lot of relays
 

1675
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,150
also like a lot of relays
have to update their relay nodes

1676
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:24,160
have to update their relay nodes
 

1677
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,870
have to update their relay nodes
uh to support the new version of the

1678
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:26,880
uh to support the new version of the
 

1679
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,270
uh to support the new version of the
bridge until uh

1680
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:29,280
bridge until uh
 

1681
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,950
bridge until uh
until this uh

1682
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:30,960
until this uh
 

1683
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,829
until this uh
intel won't be uh functionable

1684
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:33,839
intel won't be uh functionable
 

1685
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,349
intel won't be uh functionable
so uh

1686
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:35,359
so uh
 

1687
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,190
so uh
i i think that's uh

1688
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,200
i i think that's uh
 

1689
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,950
i i think that's uh
in a few hours

1690
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:38,960
in a few hours
 

1691
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,910
in a few hours
the the new bridge will be redeployed

1692
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:41,920
the the new bridge will be redeployed
 

1693
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,550
the the new bridge will be redeployed
and after that like

1694
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:44,560
and after that like
 

1695
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,030
and after that like
every every other product will be

1696
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,040
every every other product will be
 

1697
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,550

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,190
and they fixed a few a few few important
issues as i know

1730
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,200
issues as i know
 

1731
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,109
issues as i know

uh the
 

1733
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,870
uh the
like uh public audit made by let's say

1734
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:38,880
like uh public audit made by let's say
 

1735
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,349
like uh public audit made by let's say
preventer or nil foundation

1736
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:41,359
preventer or nil foundation
 

1737
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,950
preventer or nil foundation
uh will be

1738
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:42,960
uh will be
 

1739
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,630
uh will be
available uh

1740
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:44,640
available uh
 

1741
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,750
available uh
later

1742
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:45,760
later
 

1743
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,910
later
yeah it's it's extremely important i

1744
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:47,920
yeah it's it's extremely important i
 

1745
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,510
yeah it's it's extremely important i
agree

1746
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:49,520
agree
 

1747
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,990
agree
for now there is now like a public audit

1748
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,000
for now there is now like a public audit
 

1749
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,109
for now there is now like a public audit
for a new uh token implementation

1750
00:38:59,109 --> 00:38:59,119

 

1751
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,390

so uh

1752
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:00,400
so uh
 

1753
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,550
so uh
there's ah

1754
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:02,560
there's ah
 

1755
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,230
there's ah
anton is asking when dexada

1756
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,240
anton is asking when dexada
 

1757
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,950
anton is asking when dexada
uh i'm not sure i think

1758
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:08,960
uh i'm not sure i think
 

1759
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,190
uh i'm not sure i think
we should add some more people to this

1760
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:11,200
we should add some more people to this
 

1761
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,349
we should add some more people to this
conversation uh

1762
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:13,359
conversation uh
 

1763
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,550
conversation uh
i'm also interested uh i think at least

1764
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:16,560
i'm also interested uh i think at least
 

1765
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,750
i'm also interested uh i think at least
uh after the immigration

1766
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:19,760
uh after the immigration
 

1767
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,069
uh after the immigration
so

1768
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:24,079

 

1769
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,589

uh

1770
00:39:25,589 --> 00:39:25,599
uh
 

1771
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,550
uh
the last question is

1772
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:28,560
the last question is
 

1773
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,750
the last question is
what is the owner of the pool

1774
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:33,760

 

1775
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,109

will input all lp tokens in the black

1776
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:37,119
will input all lp tokens in the black
 

1777
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,150
will input all lp tokens in the black
hole

1778
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:38,160
hole
 

1779
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,270
hole
and

1780
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:39,280
and
 

1781
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,670
and
he cannot

1782
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:41,680
he cannot
 

1783
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,069
he cannot
move the old liquidity to the new

1784
00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:44,079
move the old liquidity to the new
 

1785
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,510
move the old liquidity to the new
standard what should he do

1786
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:49,520

 

1787
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,950

okay

1788
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:50,960
okay
 

1789
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,310
okay
it's also an important question

1790
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:54,320
it's also an important question
 

1791
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,750
it's also an important question
the

1792
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:57,760

 

1793
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,670

uh so for now the liquidity provider

1794
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:01,680
uh so for now the liquidity provider
 

1795
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,950
uh so for now the liquidity provider
tokens are controlled by the decks

1796
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:04,960
tokens are controlled by the decks
 

1797
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,150
tokens are controlled by the decks
itself

1798
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:06,160
itself
 

1799
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,589
itself
and we are aware of a situation like

1800
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:09,599
and we are aware of a situation like
 

1801
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,430
and we are aware of a situation like
this when they're

1802
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:11,440
this when they're
 

1803
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,910
this when they're
like full creator

1804
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:13,920
like full creator
 

1805
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,990
like full creator
have sent

1806
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:16,000
have sent
 

1807
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,109
have sent
lp's

1808
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:17,119
lp's
 

1809
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,670
lp's
tokens to the black hole

1810
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:19,680
tokens to the black hole
 

1811
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,309
tokens to the black hole
probably we will update

1812
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:22,319
probably we will update
 

1813
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,270
probably we will update
the old version of the bridge

1814
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:25,280
the old version of the bridge
 

1815
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,030
the old version of the bridge
uh

1816
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,040
uh
 

1817
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,950
uh
it's uh

1818
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:28,960
it's uh
 

1819
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,829
it's uh
it will update it in order to achieve

1820
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:31,839
it will update it in order to achieve
 

1821
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,030
it will update it in order to achieve
the control over the lps

1822
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,040
the control over the lps
 

1823
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,190
the control over the lps
uh after that probably will burn the uh

1824
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,200
uh after that probably will burn the uh
 

1825
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,670
uh after that probably will burn the uh
liquidity provider tokens locked on the

1826
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:41,680
liquidity provider tokens locked on the
 

1827
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,990
liquidity provider tokens locked on the
black hole and uh

1828
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,000
black hole and uh
 

1829
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,470
black hole and uh
means uh the same amount

1830
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:46,480
means uh the same amount
 

1831
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,589
means uh the same amount
uh to the like pull creator so after

1832
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:49,599
uh to the like pull creator so after
 

1833
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,790
uh to the like pull creator so after
that uh

1834
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:50,800
that uh
 

1835
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,349
that uh
it will be possible to uh

1836
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:53,359
it will be possible to uh
 

1837
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,670
it will be possible to uh
like withdraw your liquidity

1838
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:55,680
like withdraw your liquidity
 

1839
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,190
like withdraw your liquidity
from the old decks uh exchange it to the

1840
00:40:59,190 --> 00:40:59,200
from the old decks uh exchange it to the
 

1841
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,550
from the old decks uh exchange it to the
new standard and uh put it back uh to

1842
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:02,560
new standard and uh put it back uh to
 

1843
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,829
new standard and uh put it back uh to
the uh decks

1844
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:05,839
the uh decks
 

1845
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,550
the uh decks
i'm not sure the exact process

1846
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:08,560
i'm not sure the exact process
 

1847
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,589
i'm not sure the exact process
uh

1848
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:09,599
uh
 

1849
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,349
uh
but uh

1850
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:11,359
but uh
 

1851
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,630
but uh
we are aware of this situation and uh we

1852
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:14,640
we are aware of this situation and uh we
 

1853
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,750
we are aware of this situation and uh we
will also publish some instructions in

1854
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:17,760
will also publish some instructions in
 

1855
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,510
will also publish some instructions in
our channel

1856
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:21,520

 

1857
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,190

uh

1858
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:23,200
uh
 

1859
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,190
uh
one more question does it matter who

1860
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:25,200
one more question does it matter who
 

1861
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,750
one more question does it matter who
owns the ownership or

1862
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:27,760
owns the ownership or
 

1863
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,230
owns the ownership or
or of the root

1864
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,240
or of the root
 

1865
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,990
or of the root
contract

1866
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,000
contract
 

1867
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,670
contract
well uh it depends uh on the

1868
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:35,680
well uh it depends uh on the
 

1869
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,309
well uh it depends uh on the
you know like the use cases for your

1870
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:38,319
you know like the use cases for your
 

1871
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:39,270
you know like the use cases for your
token

1872
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:39,280
token
 

1873
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,150
token
uh

1874
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,160
uh
 

1875
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,230
uh
for example you know it's like a good

1876
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:42,240
for example you know it's like a good
 

1877
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,349
for example you know it's like a good
practice

1878
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:43,359
practice
 

1879
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,550
practice
to uh send the ownership to the black

1880
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:46,560
to uh send the ownership to the black
 

1881
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,270
to uh send the ownership to the black
hole if you don't need it you know let's

1882
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:49,280
hole if you don't need it you know let's
 

1883
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,230
hole if you don't need it you know let's
say you have a fixed supply token so it

1884
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:52,240
say you have a fixed supply token so it
 

1885
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,950
say you have a fixed supply token so it
always makes sense uh

1886
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:54,960
always makes sense uh
 

1887
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,790
always makes sense uh
it doesn't work for uh every uh

1888
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:58,800
it doesn't work for uh every uh
 

1889
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,150
it doesn't work for uh every uh
scenario

1890
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,160
scenario
 

1891
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,150
scenario
let's say our tokens uh owned

1892
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,160
let's say our tokens uh owned
 

1893
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,270
let's say our tokens uh owned
by the

1894
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:05,280
by the
 

1895
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,390
by the
bridge

1896
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:06,400
bridge
 

1897
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,390
bridge
so they can be minted each time the

1898
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:10,400
so they can be minted each time the
 

1899
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,349
so they can be minted each time the
