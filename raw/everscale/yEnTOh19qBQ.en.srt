and
 

69
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,310
and
you know sort of things um we're waiting

70
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
you know sort of things um we're waiting
 

71
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,670
you know sort of things um we're waiting
for the

72
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:17,680
for the
 

73
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,429
for the
network to

74
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
network to
 

75
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,830
network to
kind of upgrade itself to the to the

76
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
kind of upgrade itself to the to the
 

77
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,350
kind of upgrade itself to the to the
like acceptable numbers like over 95 or

78
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
like acceptable numbers like over 95 or
 

79
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,550
like acceptable numbers like over 95 or
something

80
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
something
 

81
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,350
something
and as usual it goes quite well it's um

82
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
and as usual it goes quite well it's um
 

83
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,710
and as usual it goes quite well it's um
goes very fast uh until like 90 percent

84
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
goes very fast uh until like 90 percent
 

85
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,069
goes very fast uh until like 90 percent
or something and then

86
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
or something and then
 

87
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,830
or something and then
there is this 10 percent of people who

88
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
there is this 10 percent of people who
 

89
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,230
there is this 10 percent of people who
just don't give a

90
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
just don't give a
 

91
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,190
just don't give a
i don't know it's uh all sorts of

92
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
i don't know it's uh all sorts of
 

93
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,270
i don't know it's uh all sorts of
strange numbers strange versions that

94
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
strange numbers strange versions that
 

95
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,870
strange numbers strange versions that
they're running with their notes like

96
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
they're running with their notes like
 

97
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,389
they're running with their notes like
node version 14 by wearing 22 and so on

98
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
node version 14 by wearing 22 and so on
 

99
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,069
node version 14 by wearing 22 and so on
so 53

100
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,079
so 53
 

101
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,830
so 53
so on and so forth

102
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
so on and so forth
 

103
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,069
so on and so forth
so you always have this 10 lazy percent

104
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
so you always have this 10 lazy percent
 

105
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,830
so you always have this 10 lazy percent
that's why we have a

106
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
that's why we have a
 

107
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,109
that's why we have a
soft majority voting mechanism where we

108
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
soft majority voting mechanism where we
 

109
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,910
soft majority voting mechanism where we
should have having that mechanism but we

110
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
should have having that mechanism but we
 

111
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,709
should have having that mechanism but we
don't but anyway

112
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:06,719
don't but anyway
 

113
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,389
don't but anyway
so um

114
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
so um
 

115
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,830
so um
so we will wait

116
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
so we will wait
 

117
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,430
so we will wait
in the meantime

118
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
in the meantime
 

119
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,390
in the meantime
um we're checking on the like on the

120
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
um we're checking on the like on the
 

121
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,670
um we're checking on the like on the
devnet

122
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
devnet
 

123
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,869
devnet
um

124
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
um
 

125
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,990
um
the next

126
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
the next
 

127
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,150
the next
kind of switch

128
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
kind of switch
 

129
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,949
kind of switch
of the configuration parameters which

130
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
of the configuration parameters which
 

131
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,470
of the configuration parameters which
will enable

132
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
will enable
 

133
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,589
will enable
all these

134
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
all these
 

135
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,589
all these
wonderful features that are in this

136
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
wonderful features that are in this
 

137
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,470
wonderful features that are in this
upgrade so um

138
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
upgrade so um
 

139
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,630
upgrade so um
it's kind of a two-step process

140
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
it's kind of a two-step process
 

141
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,630
it's kind of a two-step process
including compression but also many

142
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
including compression but also many
 

143
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,710
including compression but also many
other things

144
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
other things
 

145
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,390
other things
and we're also working on copyleft

146
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
and we're also working on copyleft
 

147
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,390
and we're also working on copyleft
instruction as well

148
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
instruction as well
 

149
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,589
instruction as well
um

150
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
um
 

151
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,750
um
so it's in testing now

152
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
so it's in testing now
 

153
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,910
so it's in testing now
and the copyleft instruction requires

154
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
and the copyleft instruction requires
 

155
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,830
and the copyleft instruction requires
certain upgrades to the

156
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840
certain upgrades to the
 

157
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,509
certain upgrades to the
to the configuration parameters of the

158
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
to the configuration parameters of the
 

159
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,670
to the configuration parameters of the
network which

160
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
network which
 

161
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,430
network which
which need to be done

162
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
which need to be done
 

163
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,990
which need to be done
in a certain particular way

164
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
in a certain particular way
 

165
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,110
in a certain particular way
that's

166
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
that's
 

167
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,949
that's
like it's complicated tiny things that

168
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
like it's complicated tiny things that
 

169
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,350
like it's complicated tiny things that
should just work

170
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
should just work
 

171
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,830
should just work
uh like 100

172
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
uh like 100
 

173
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,509
uh like 100
because if they don't

174
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
because if they don't
 

175
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,110
because if they don't
they have problems with networks so

176
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
they have problems with networks so
 

177
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,869
they have problems with networks so
that's why this is like

178
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
that's why this is like
 

179
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,869
that's why this is like
this does take time because it takes

180
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879
this does take time because it takes
 

181
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,949
this does take time because it takes
time to verify and check them a lot

182
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
time to verify and check them a lot
 

183
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,350
time to verify and check them a lot
um so that's really

184
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
um so that's really
 

185
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,190
um so that's really
that's really

186
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
that's really
 

187
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,270
that's really
the thing once we upgrade it

188
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
the thing once we upgrade it
 

189

fee and this fee will be
 

867
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,350
fee and this fee will be
in land tokens and this fee will be

in land tokens and this fee will be
 

869
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,909
in land tokens and this fee will be
burned so this is how we plan to reduce

870
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
burned so this is how we plan to reduce
 

871
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,310
burned so this is how we plan to reduce
total amount of tokens

872

total amount of tokens
 

873
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,710
