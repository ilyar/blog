engine but it was uh quite difficult
because it

because it
 

247
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,070
because it
it wasn't well adapted for a web

make bridges so this is something uh
that's already on

516
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399
that's already on
 

517
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,910
that's already on
on rails

518
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:11,920
on rails
 

519
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,750
on rails
um and uh

520
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
um and uh
 

521
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,629
um and uh
yeah this this was just a test for me

522
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639
yeah this this was just a test for me
 

523
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,710
yeah this this was just a test for me
and uh when i saw that

524
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:18,720
and uh when i saw that
 

525
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,910
and uh when i saw that
it works uh i try to make other stuff

526
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
it works uh i try to make other stuff
 

527
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,189
it works uh i try to make other stuff
like my own metaverse for me

528
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:25,199
like my own metaverse for me
 

529
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,030
like my own metaverse for me
and this is uh

530

and this is uh
 

531
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,829
and this is uh
this is also another experiment i call

532
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:29,839
this is also another experiment i call
 

533
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,949
this is also another experiment i call
it the international metastation like as

534
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
it the international metastation like as
 

535
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,150
it the international metastation like as
international cosmos station

536
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
international cosmos station
 

537
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,150
international cosmos station
yes

first moment yeah so and here we are we
 

545
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,990
first moment yeah so and here we are we
can see all those projects that i

546
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,000
can see all those projects that i
 

547
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,069

every yeah every blockchain must to
start to build something like this and

i i didn't really dive into the
 

961
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,269
i i didn't really dive into the
technology but i heard that it's not

962
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:45,279
technology but i heard that it's not
 

963
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,510
technology but i heard that it's not
really stable it needs like you to

964
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:49,520
really stable it needs like you to
 

965
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,390
really stable it needs like you to
maintain some node which will keep all

966
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,400
maintain some node which will keep all
 

967
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,110
maintain some node which will keep all
of your data and if you disable this

968
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,120
of your data and if you disable this
 

969
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,510
of your data and if you disable this
node all this data

970

node all this data
 

971
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,070
node all this data
there is some risk that all this data

972
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,080
there is some risk that all this data
 

973
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,470
there is some risk that all this data
will be lost unless someone is like

974
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:04,480
will be lost unless someone is like
 

975
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,110
will be lost unless someone is like
requesting it over and over again so

976
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,120
requesting it over and over again so
 

977
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,630
requesting it over and over again so
it's like a torrent

978
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640
it's like a torrent
 

979
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,350
it's like a torrent
like

980
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,360
like
 

981
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,470
like
if you remove your seed node like uh

982
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:12,480
if you remove your seed node like uh
 

983
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,269

00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:42,960
chain if i'm not mistaken how how can we
 

1095
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,630
chain if i'm not mistaken how how can we
jump in uh to whatever stuff with that

jump in uh to whatever stuff with that
 

1097

and they cost a lot of money and require

1528
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:33,680
and they cost a lot of money and require
 

1529
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,069
and they cost a lot of money and require
a lot of documentation uh a lot of the

1530
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:36,079
a lot of documentation uh a lot of the
 

1531
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,069
a lot of documentation uh a lot of the
newer platforms are heavily linked to

1532
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079
newer platforms are heavily linked to
 

1533
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,390
newer platforms are heavily linked to
banks so as a result you know maybe if

1534
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:40,400
banks so as a result you know maybe if
 

1535
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,310
banks so as a result you know maybe if
you want to send money to different

1536
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:42,320
you want to send money to different
 

1537
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,470
you want to send money to different
african countries you can only send

1538
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:44,480
african countries you can only send
 

1539
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,910
african countries you can only send
within maybe

1540
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:45,920
within maybe
 

1541
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,950
within maybe
nigeria to ghana or a total of about

1542
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:48,960
nigeria to ghana or a total of about
 

1543
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,349
nigeria to ghana or a total of about
four or five countries and then um

1544
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:51,359
four or five countries and then um
 

1545
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,190
four or five countries and then um
because of this a lot of africans have

1546
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,200
because of this a lot of africans have
 

1547
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,230
because of this a lot of africans have
resorted to you know sending money using

1548
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:56,240
resorted to you know sending money using
 

1549
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,069
resorted to you know sending money using
peer-to-peer channels but most of these

1550
00:35:58,069 --> 00:35:58,079
peer-to-peer channels but most of these
 

1551
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,589
peer-to-peer channels but most of these
peer-to-peer channels have been very

1552
00:35:59,589 --> 00:35:59,599
peer-to-peer channels have been very
 

1553
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,150
peer-to-peer channels have been very
informal and offline so that means they

1554
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,160
informal and offline so that means they
 

1555
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,870
informal and offline so that means they
go meet you know a

1556
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:04,880
go meet you know a
 

1557
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,190
go meet you know a
money exchange dealer on the street and

1558
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:07,200
money exchange dealer on the street and
 

1559
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,430
money exchange dealer on the street and
then they hand them their currency and

1560
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:09,440
then they hand them their currency and
 

1561
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,670
then they hand them their currency and
then that dealer facilitates the

1562
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:11,680
then that dealer facilitates the
 

1563
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,990
then that dealer facilitates the
exchange to a different country so the

1564
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,000
exchange to a different country so the
 

1565
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,069
exchange to a different country so the
problem with this is that it's very uh

1566
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:18,079
problem with this is that it's very uh
 

1567
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,470
problem with this is that it's very uh
it's it's it's very uh it's prone to

1568
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:20,480
it's it's it's very uh it's prone to
 

1569
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,430
it's it's it's very uh it's prone to
fraud

1570
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:21,440
fraud
 

1571
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,109
fraud
and then because you're dealing with

1572
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:23,119
and then because you're dealing with
 

1573
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,790
and then because you're dealing with
someone who you don't know at all

1574
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:24,800
someone who you don't know at all
 

1575
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,950
someone who you don't know at all
there's a lot of security risks involved

1576
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:26,960
there's a lot of security risks involved
 

1577
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,510
there's a lot of security risks involved
and it also takes a very long time the

1578
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:29,520
and it also takes a very long time the
 

1579
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,950
and it also takes a very long time the
second problem that piggy fi is solving

1580
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:32,960
second problem that piggy fi is solving
 

1581
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,829
second problem that piggy fi is solving
relates to saving money within africa so

1582
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:35,839
relates to saving money within africa so
 

1583
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,510
relates to saving money within africa so
in africa as

1584
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:37,520
in africa as
 

1585
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,750
in africa as
i don't know if you guys are aware but

1586
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:39,760
i don't know if you guys are aware but
 

1587
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,510
i don't know if you guys are aware but
we have some of the highest inflation

1588
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:41,520
we have some of the highest inflation
 

1589
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,069
we have some of the highest inflation
and evaluation rates in the world uh as

1590
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:44,079
and evaluation rates in the world uh as
 

1591
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,589
and evaluation rates in the world uh as
you can see in the chat below you can

1592
00:36:45,589 --> 00:36:45,599
you can see in the chat below you can
 

1593
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,190
you can see in the chat below you can
see that and nigeria zimbabwe and a few

1594
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,200
see that and nigeria zimbabwe and a few
 

1595
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,589
see that and nigeria zimbabwe and a few
other countries have inflation rates as

1596
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:51,599
other countries have inflation rates as
 

1597
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,630
other countries have inflation rates as
high as 17 percent uh zimbabwe as you

1598
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:54,640
high as 17 percent uh zimbabwe as you
 

1599
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,790
high as 17 percent uh zimbabwe as you
can see has 107

1600
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:56,800
can see has 107
 

1601
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,710
can see has 107
so as a result of this a lot of people

1602
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:58,720
so as a result of this a lot of people
 

1603
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,630
so as a result of this a lot of people
don't like saving in their local

1604
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:00,640
don't like saving in their local
 

1605

currencies they prefer saving in a
 

1607
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,870
currencies they prefer saving in a
foreign currency but there's very few

1608
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:04,880
foreign currency but there's very few
 

1609
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,670
foreign currency but there's very few
applications that allow people uh solve

1610
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:07,680
applications that allow people uh solve
 

1611
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,829
applications that allow people uh solve
these problems so what piggyfire has

i'm just a brief about our solution so

1620
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,200
i'm just a brief about our solution so
 

1621
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,589
i'm just a brief about our solution so
what we do is that we use the blockchain

technology and how that peer-to-peer
 

1711
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,950
technology and how that peer-to-peer
system works uh it's a bit complicated

1712
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:08,960
system works uh it's a bit complicated
 

1713
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,109
system works uh it's a bit complicated
but i'll just try to simplify it and i'm

1714
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:11,119
but i'll just try to simplify it and i'm
 

1715

of the burrito changes and a system
 

1851
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,270
of the burrito changes and a system
called the hawala system so the problem

1852
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:01,280
called the hawala system so the problem
 

1853
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,750

i said earlier and then a lot of it is
 

1857
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,630
i said earlier and then a lot of it is
also very manual and is used for money

1858

also very manual and is used for money
 

1859
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,829
also very manual and is used for money
laundering then other systems such as uh

swift wire transfers are very slow and
 

1865
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,670
swift wire transfers are very slow and
uh they actually cost a lot of money

1866
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:19,680
uh they actually cost a lot of money
 

1867

uh they actually cost a lot of money
some of the modern fintechs have tried

1868
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:21,440
some of the modern fintechs have tried
 

1869
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,230
some of the modern fintechs have tried
to use crypto to solve this problem but

1870
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:24,240
to use crypto to solve this problem but
 

1871
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,069
to use crypto to solve this problem but
a lot of them still rely heavily on

1872
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:26,079
a lot of them still rely heavily on
 

1873
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,430
a lot of them still rely heavily on
banks while we rely on our p2p system

1874
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:29,440
banks while we rely on our p2p system
 

1875
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,829
banks while we rely on our p2p system
and this p2p system gives us certain

1876
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:31,839
and this p2p system gives us certain
 

1877
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,190
and this p2p system gives us certain
advantages such as being easier to scale

1878
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,200
advantages such as being easier to scale
 

1879
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,589
advantages such as being easier to scale
and also being censorship proof so

1880
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:37,599
and also being censorship proof so
 

1881
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,790
and also being censorship proof so
because it's the decentralized system uh

1882
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:40,800
because it's the decentralized system uh
 

1883
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,190
because it's the decentralized system uh
you know the government or banks or

other regulatory bodies can't easily
shut it down because they would have to

1888
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:47,920
shut it down because they would have to
 

1889
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,790
shut it down because they would have to
you know rely on the white so

1890

you know rely on the white so
 

1891
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,069
you know rely on the white so
before they can shut it down they'll

1892
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:52,079
before they can shut it down they'll
 

1893
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,069
before they can shut it down they'll
have to shut down you know multiple

1894
00:42:54,069 --> 00:42:54,079
have to shut down you know multiple
 

1895
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,670
have to shut down you know multiple
nodes or multiple p2p uh accounts which

nodes or multiple p2p uh accounts which
 

1897
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,069
nodes or multiple p2p uh accounts which
will prove to be very difficult then

1898
00:43:00,069 --> 00:43:00,079
will prove to be very difficult then
 

1899
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,069
will prove to be very difficult then

okay so so basically you're just using

2376
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:50,720
okay so so basically you're just using
 

2377
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:57,510
okay so so basically you're just using
the platform as a as a as a back end

2378
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:57,520

 

2379
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,829

i don't get a question for you

2380
00:52:59,829 --> 00:52:59,839
i don't get a question for you
 

2381
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:01,270
i don't get a question for you
you're using it as a backend because

2382
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:01,280
you're using it as a backend because
 

2383
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,710
you're using it as a backend because
basically it's just a fast blockchain

2384
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:02,720
basically it's just a fast blockchain
 

2385
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,030
basically it's just a fast blockchain
where you can make the transaction go by

2386
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:05,040
where you can make the transaction go by
 

2387
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,589
where you can make the transaction go by
a lot quicker is have you already

2388
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:07,599
a lot quicker is have you already
 

2389
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,030
a lot quicker is have you already
implemented the

2390
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:09,040

integrate other blockchains including
everscale is that um because this api is

2422
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:48,319
everscale is that um because this api is
 

2423
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,150
everscale is that um because this api is
being released to several companies

2424
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:50,160
being released to several companies
 

2425
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,190
being released to several companies
there might be other uh maybe partners

2426
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:53,200
there might be other uh maybe partners
 

2427
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,910
there might be other uh maybe partners
of everscale who are looking to you know

integrate payments within africa and as
a result of this um instead of them

2432
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:01,200
a result of this um instead of them
 

2433
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,589
a result of this um instead of them
having to build their system into and

2434
00:54:03,589 --> 00:54:03,599
having to build their system into and
 

2435
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,910
having to build their system into and
they can actually plug into uh piggy

2436
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:05,920
they can actually plug into uh piggy
 

2437
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,270
they can actually plug into uh piggy
fry's api and then with this uh p2p api

2438
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:09,280
fry's api and then with this uh p2p api
 

2439
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,670
fry's api and then with this uh p2p api
they can accept payments um easily

2440
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:11,680
they can accept payments um easily
 

2441
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,710
they can accept payments um easily
within africa so it's um your

2442
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:14,720
within africa so it's um your
 

2443
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,470
within africa so it's um your
your partnerships with other companies

2444
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:16,480
your partnerships with other companies
 

2445
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,910
your partnerships with other companies
can actually be uh much more effective

2446
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:19,920
can actually be uh much more effective
 

2447
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,309
can actually be uh much more effective
you know within africa for payments

2448
00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:22,319
you know within africa for payments
 

2449
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:23,510
you know within africa for payments
rather than

2450
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:23,520
rather than
 

2451
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,790
rather than
having to start from scratch

2452
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:26,800
having to start from scratch
 

2453
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,430

um and they would be so so be a conduit

2454
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:29,440
um and they would be so so be a conduit
 

2455
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,150
um and they would be so so be a conduit
like uh but essentially it would be

2456
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:32,160
like uh but essentially it would be
 

2457
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,349
like uh but essentially it would be
because what we're doing is we're

2458
00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:33,359
because what we're doing is we're
 

2459
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,829
because what we're doing is we're
transferring money right uh through the

00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:41,440
what they are going to want to do is
 

2467
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,549
what they are going to want to do is
they're going to want to convert them

2468
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:42,559
they're going to want to convert them
 

2469
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,670
they're going to want to convert them
into some sort of fiat currency correct

2470
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:45,680
into some sort of fiat currency correct

important research
and what we

2556
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:36,960
and what we
 

2557
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,430
and what we
found in our research also with

more fun
so that's also the reason why we started

2572
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:53,119
so that's also the reason why we started
 

2573
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,670
so that's also the reason why we started
our research we found like a couple

2574
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:55,680
our research we found like a couple
 

2575
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,990
our research we found like a couple
problems and four major problems says

2576
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:58,000
problems and four major problems says

00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,789
always very transparent it's very
difficult to

2582
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:04,799
difficult to
 

2583
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:05,670
difficult to
uh

2584
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:05,680
uh
 

2585
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,069
uh
make like a payment infrastructure and

2586
00:57:08,069 --> 00:57:08,079
make like a payment infrastructure and
 

2587
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,190
make like a payment infrastructure and
donations

2588

donations
 

2589
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,990
donations
create a lot of administration and one

2590
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:12,000
create a lot of administration and one
 

2591
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,349
create a lot of administration and one
of the last thing is that because of

2592
00:57:13,349 --> 00:57:13,359
of the last thing is that because of
 

2593
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,910
of the last thing is that because of
over 19 at that time it was very

2594
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:15,920
over 19 at that time it was very
 

2595
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,030
over 19 at that time it was very
difficult also to start like events like

2596
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:19,040
difficult also to start like events like

your uh your donators and that's the
 

2603
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,430
your uh your donators and that's the
reason why we started the media gifts

2604
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:27,440
reason why we started the media gifts
 

2605
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,589
reason why we started the media gifts
and the immediate uses the the power of

2606
00:57:29,589 --> 00:57:29,599
and the immediate uses the the power of
 

2607
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,670
and the immediate uses the the power of
the blockchain infrastructure to create

2608
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:31,680
the blockchain infrastructure to create
 

2609
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,990
the blockchain infrastructure to create
the most easy transparent and fun nsa uh

2610

their own platform
so a little bit in a nutshell our

2622
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:52,000
so a little bit in a nutshell our
 

2623
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,309
so a little bit in a nutshell our
protocols that donate as they can make a

2624
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:54,319
protocols that donate as they can make a
 

2625
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:55,510
protocols that donate as they can make a
wallet so

2626
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:55,520
wallet so
 

2627
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,430
wallet so
they can connect their wallet under the

2628
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:57,440
they can connect their wallet under the
 

2629
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,990

2633
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,870
connecting already
a couple wallets one of those also like

2634
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:04,880
a couple wallets one of those also like
 

2635
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,950
a couple wallets one of those also like
every skill what you can do is that

2636
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:06,960
every skill what you can do is that
 

2637
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,990
every skill what you can do is that
people can donate nf days uh to the

2638
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:10,000
people can donate nf days uh to the
 

2639
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,549
people can donate nf days uh to the
charities and people they can bid on it

2640
00:58:12,549 --> 00:58:12,559
charities and people they can bid on it
 

2641
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,549
charities and people they can bid on it
and that means that the highest bid that

2642
00:58:14,549 --> 00:58:14,559
and that means that the highest bid that
 

2643
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,670
and that means that the highest bid that
money will go directly to the charity so

2644
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:17,680
money will go directly to the charity so
 

2645
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,670
money will go directly to the charity so
the great thing about this is that you

2646
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:19,680
the great thing about this is that you
 

2647
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,670
the great thing about this is that you
have a better peer-to-peer

2648
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:21,680
have a better peer-to-peer
 

2649
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,710
have a better peer-to-peer
system

2650
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:22,720
system
 

2651
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,390
system
in a more fun way and this money can go

2652
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:26,400
in a more fun way and this money can go
 

2653
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,270
in a more fun way and this money can go
to the charity wall wallet directly

2654
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:29,280
to the charity wall wallet directly
 

2655
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,109
to the charity wall wallet directly
so there's not a lot of

2656
00:58:31,109 --> 00:58:31,119
so there's not a lot of
 

2657
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:32,870
so there's not a lot of
organizations in between

2658
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:32,880
organizations in between
 

2659
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,150
organizations in between
and this

2660
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:34,160
and this
 

2661
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,990
and this
gives us a more transparent way because

2662
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:36,000
gives us a more transparent way because
 

2663
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,910
gives us a more transparent way because
we also know that for example like

2664
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:37,920
we also know that for example like
 

2665
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,750
we also know that for example like
governments but also pharmaceutical

01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:28,640
blockchain projects for example in the
 

3159
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,269
blockchain projects for example in the
netherlands they close a lot of

3160
01:08:31,269 --> 01:08:31,279
netherlands they close a lot of
 

3161
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,189
netherlands they close a lot of
change but if we see for example in

3162
01:08:33,189 --> 01:08:33,199
change but if we see for example in
 

3163
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:35,590
change but if we see for example in
wyoming in the us they're also changing

3164
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:35,600
wyoming in the us they're also changing
 

3165
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,070
wyoming in the us they're also changing
the regulatory laws and there so i think

3166
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:38,080
the regulatory laws and there so i think
 

3167
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,669
the regulatory laws and there so i think
we are like in an industry that is

3168
01:08:39,669 --> 01:08:39,679
we are like in an industry that is
 

3169
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:41,829
we are like in an industry that is
changing really really rapidly of sort

3170
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:41,839
changing really really rapidly of sort
 

3171
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:45,189
changing really really rapidly of sort
of context there but i think it's a good

3172
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:45,199
of context there but i think it's a good
 

3173
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:46,550
of context there but i think it's a good
question i think the most important

3174
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:46,560
question i think the most important
 

3175
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,470
question i think the most important
thing is that we know that for example a

3176
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:48,480
thing is that we know that for example a
 

3177
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:49,910
thing is that we know that for example a
lot of donations are now are not

3178
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:49,920
lot of donations are now are not
 

3179
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,149
lot of donations are now are not
transable so we don't know for example

3180
01:08:52,149 --> 01:08:52,159
transable so we don't know for example
 

3181
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:54,149
transable so we don't know for example
where the money is going through so i

3182
01:08:54,149 --> 01:08:54,159
where the money is going through so i
 

3183
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:56,630
where the money is going through so i
think this is a big big adventures and i

3184
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:56,640
think this is a big big adventures and i
 

3185
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,630
think this is a big big adventures and i
for example also like in politics where

3186
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:58,640
for example also like in politics where
 

3187
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,709
for example also like in politics where
a lot of people want to support their

3188
01:09:00,709 --> 01:09:00,719
a lot of people want to support their
 

3189
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:08,470
a lot of people want to support their
own parish so

3190
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:08,480

 

3191
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,269

if you can make them more transparent um

3192
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:11,279
if you can make them more transparent um
 

3193
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:12,630
if you can make them more transparent um
is to make it more accessible for

3194
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:12,640
is to make it more accessible for
 

3195
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,229
is to make it more accessible for
everyone if you don't have money you can

3196
