we are going to have votes on a weekly

228
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
we are going to have votes on a weekly

we are going to have votes on a weekly
basis in batches

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,469
basis in batches
the reason for the batches is because

232
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
the reason for the batches is because
 

233
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,189
the reason for the batches is because
it's logistically and operationally

each partner uh will be asked well we're

00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
each partner uh will be asked well we're
 

257
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,749
each partner uh will be asked well we're
gonna provide the analytics on each

258
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
gonna provide the analytics on each
 

259
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,230
gonna provide the analytics on each
partner they already exist but it'll be

260

partner they already exist but it'll be
 

261
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,550
partner they already exist but it'll be
just a little bit more formal uh with a

00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
just a little bit more formal uh with a

and based on that
 

269
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,469
and based on that
every partner that has brought

270
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
every partner that has brought
 

271
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,790
every partner that has brought
significant value to the network has

272
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
significant value to the network has
 

273
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,230
significant value to the network has
done what they said

it's not going to be fast
this is a very very complicated process

this is a very very complicated process
 

347
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,230
this is a very very complicated process
especially when it comes to partners

348
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
especially when it comes to partners
 

349
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,150
especially when it comes to partners
because frankly there's just so many of

them and we owe them
 

353
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,230
them and we owe them

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
background of everything that we have
 

361
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,150
background of everything that we have
and we also owe them the opportunity to

and we also owe them the opportunity to
 

363
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,270
and we also owe them the opportunity to
respond that's the way business is done

364
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
respond that's the way business is done
 

365
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,029
respond that's the way business is done
but in the end

366
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
but in the end
 

367
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,390
but in the end
we're doing it

368
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
we're doing it
 

369
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,390
we're doing it
starting today

370
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
starting today
 

371
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,830
starting today
so

372
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
so
 

373
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,110
so
that's about it

374
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
that's about it
 

375
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,909
that's about it
for

376

381
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,710

i would have figured there'd been a

382
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
i would have figured there'd been a
 

383
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,990
i would have figured there'd been a
million questions but we'll see what

384
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
million questions but we'll see what
 

385
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,830
million questions but we'll see what
happens on youtube if we don't have any

386
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
happens on youtube if we don't have any
 

387
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,670
happens on youtube if we don't have any
questions i think everybody is just

388
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
questions i think everybody is just
 

389
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,589
questions i think everybody is just
shocked wrong by what you said so if

390
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
shocked wrong by what you said so if
 

391
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,589
shocked wrong by what you said so if
people are digesting

392
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,599
people are digesting
 

393
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,469
people are digesting
okay well digest it um i i don't think

we have like updated the devnet with uh
 

449
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,710
we have like updated the devnet with uh
with

450
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
with
 

451
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,110
with
like patch which solves the problem with

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
like patch which solves the problem with
 

453
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,189
like patch which solves the problem with
the big accounts

454
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
the big accounts
 

455
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,510
the big accounts
but

456
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520

 

457
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,629

during that update

458
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
during that update
 

459
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,790
during that update
we have realized that

460
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
we have realized that
 

461
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,430
we have realized that
because of some

462
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
because of some
 

463
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,230
because of some
bug that was presented

464
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,240
bug that was presented
 

465
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,589
bug that was presented
um long ago and nobody really could

466
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
um long ago and nobody really could
 

467
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,670
um long ago and nobody really could
catch it because it was like an obscure

468
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
catch it because it was like an obscure
 

469
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,110
catch it because it was like an obscure
branch

470
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
branch
 

471
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,430
branch
which we never touched

472
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
which we never touched
 

473
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,590
which we never touched
in code and this

474
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
in code and this
 

475
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,230
in code and this
account

476
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240

 

477
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,430

kind of

478
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
kind of
 

479
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,509
kind of
revealed that back i would say

480
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
revealed that back i would say
 

481
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,150
revealed that back i would say
it wasn't really critical but

482
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160
it wasn't really critical but
 

483
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,269
it wasn't really critical but
we couldn't

484
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:57,279
we couldn't
 

485
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,269
we couldn't
update because of that

486
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
update because of that
 

487
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,509
update because of that
and um so we had to

488
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
and um so we had to
 

489
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,150
and um so we had to
like resync like resync the database

490
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
like resync like resync the database
 

491
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,269
like resync like resync the database
basically

492
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
basically
 

493
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,430
basically
um

494
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440

 

495
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,190

okay everything was fixed and everything

496
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
okay everything was fixed and everything
 

497
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,230
okay everything was fixed and everything
is great

498
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
is great
 

499
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,829
is great
the only problem is that we cannot

500
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
the only problem is that we cannot
 

501
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,910
the only problem is that we cannot
really re-sync the database like that on

502
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920
really re-sync the database like that on
 

503
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,150
really re-sync the database like that on
the main net because it involves too

504
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
the main net because it involves too
 

505
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,750
the main net because it involves too
much coordination

506
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
much coordination
 

507
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,470
much coordination
so instead of doing this we

508
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
so instead of doing this we
 

509
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,910
so instead of doing this we
we're preparing the patch now which

510
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
we're preparing the patch now which
 

511
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,990
we're preparing the patch now which
which will basically

512
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
which will basically
 

513
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,949
which will basically
update

514
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
update
 

515
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,310
update
the corrupted

516
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
the corrupted
 

517
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,310
the corrupted
cells in the database

518
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
cells in the database
 

519
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,829
cells in the database
by itself

520
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
by itself
 

521
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,269
by itself
and that patch

522
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279
and that patch
 

523
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,829
and that patch
will go out this week so we're testing

524
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:37,839
will go out this week so we're testing
 

525
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,269
will go out this week so we're testing
that and this patch will also introduce

526
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
that and this patch will also introduce
 

527
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,310
that and this patch will also introduce
some other

528
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
some other
 

529
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,509
some other
interesting stuff that was not

530
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:45,519
interesting stuff that was not
 

531
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,829
interesting stuff that was not
part of the patch that we have released

532
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
part of the patch that we have released
 

533
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,949
part of the patch that we have released
last time

534
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
last time
 

535
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,630
last time
and that's include the compression which

536
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
and that's include the compression which
 

537
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,949
and that's include the compression which
a lot of people were asking about so the

538
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959
a lot of people were asking about so the
 

539
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,949
a lot of people were asking about so the
compression is here it will be

540
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
compression is here it will be
 

541
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,150
compression is here it will be
introduced this week uh to the network

542
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
introduced this week uh to the network
 

543
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,509
introduced this week uh to the network
and uh

544
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
and uh
 

545
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,190
and uh
you know so yeah so many people have

546
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
you know so yeah so many people have
 

547
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,590
you know so yeah so many people have
asked about that and yeah

548
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
asked about that and yeah
 

549
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,670
asked about that and yeah
but the incompatibility with c plus plus

550
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
but the incompatibility with c plus plus
 

551
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,269
but the incompatibility with c plus plus
not is already there uh anyway and not

552
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
not is already there uh anyway and not
 

553
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,590
not is already there uh anyway and not
only about because of compression

554
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
only about because of compression
 

555
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,269
only about because of compression
there is an announcement that is going

556
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
there is an announcement that is going
 

557
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,790
there is an announcement that is going
to be released today

about the breaking changes in

560
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
about the breaking changes in
 

561
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,630
about the breaking changes in
because we introduced several new

562
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
because we introduced several new
 

563
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,389
because we introduced several new
instructions as you know including my

564
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399
instructions as you know including my
 

565
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,790
instructions as you know including my
code that they need

566
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
code that they need
 

567
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,110
code that they need
to the tdm

568
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
to the tdm
 

569
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,710
to the tdm
that uh subsequently

570
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
that uh subsequently
 

571
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,470
that uh subsequently
leads to a led to the

572
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
leads to a led to the
 

573
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,790
leads to a led to the
changes in account

574
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
changes in account
 

575
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,550
changes in account
structure

576
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
structure
 

577
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,509
structure
so the tlbs him describing this will be

578
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:41,519
so the tlbs him describing this will be
 

579
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,310
so the tlbs him describing this will be
released and

580
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
released and
 

581
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,870
released and
it is a breaking change so in order we

582
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
it is a breaking change so in order we
 

583
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,910
it is a breaking change so in order we
will we will have like a gracial

584
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:49,920
will we will have like a gracial
 

585
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,910
will we will have like a gracial
kind of um

586
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
kind of um
 

587
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,150
kind of um
roll out so basically we'll roll out but

588
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
roll out so basically we'll roll out but
 

589
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,590
roll out so basically we'll roll out but
the sdk you need to update the sdk

590
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
the sdk you need to update the sdk
 

591
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,230
the sdk you need to update the sdk
to the latest version and the sdk

592
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
to the latest version and the sdk
 

593
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,030
to the latest version and the sdk
version will for some time support both

594
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
version will for some time support both
 

595
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,310
version will for some time support both
accounts

596
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:04,320
accounts
 

597
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,269
accounts
so you can migrate your applications

598
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279
so you can migrate your applications
 

599
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,190
so you can migrate your applications
that also breaks

600
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
that also breaks
 

601
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,710
that also breaks
any other front-end solutions

602
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
any other front-end solutions
 

603
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,550
any other front-end solutions
that has been introduced

604
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
that has been introduced
 

605
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,069
that has been introduced
to the network

606
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
to the network
 

607
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,190
to the network
so

608
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
so
 

609
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,030
so
whoever is doing this

610
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
whoever is doing this
 

611
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,910
whoever is doing this
solutions and they know broxas has one

612
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
solutions and they know broxas has one
 

613
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,269
solutions and they know broxas has one
will need to

614
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279
will need to
 

615
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,389
will need to
upgrade

616
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
upgrade
 

617
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,550
upgrade
their

618
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
their
 

619
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,389
their
their code

620
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
their code
 

621
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,509
their code
to support this new account structures

622
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
to support this new account structures
 

623
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,110
to support this new account structures
so new account structure basically

624
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,120
so new account structure basically
 

625
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,550
so new account structure basically
so um

626
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
so um
 

627
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,829
so um
and yeah and uh and uh the announce

628
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
and yeah and uh and uh the announce
 

629
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,949
and yeah and uh and uh the announce
about that is going out today and you

630
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
about that is going out today and you
 

631
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,750
about that is going out today and you
have some time to do that but not a lot

632
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
have some time to do that but not a lot
 

633
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,110
have some time to do that but not a lot
um before like the capability will be

634
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,120
um before like the capability will be
 

635
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,870
um before like the capability will be
turned on

636
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:50,880
turned on
 

637
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,389
turned on
on the main network and

638
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
on the main network and
 

639
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,310
on the main network and
in this instructions will kick

640
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
in this instructions will kick
 

641
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,590
in this instructions will kick
on

642
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
on
 

643
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,269
on
is the only instruction that is not yet

644
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
is the only instruction that is not yet
 

645
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,829
is the only instruction that is not yet
released that we're planning to is uh is

646
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839
released that we're planning to is uh is
 

647
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,430
released that we're planning to is uh is
um

648
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440
um
 

649
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,110
um
copyleft instruction which is very

650
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
copyleft instruction which is very
 

651
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,629
copyleft instruction which is very
important one

652
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
important one
 

653
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,470
important one
and um we will we're testing that now

654
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,480
and um we will we're testing that now
 

655
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,389
and um we will we're testing that now
probably will be in the next release

656
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
probably will be in the next release
 

657

so this week only that
 

659
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,110
so this week only that
and we will turn on compression

660
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
and we will turn on compression
 

661
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,430
and we will turn on compression
um some other

662
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
um some other
 

663
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,030
um some other
smaller things which i don't want to

664
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
smaller things which i don't want to
 

665
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,509
smaller things which i don't want to
mention now and um

666
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519
mention now and um
 

667
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,350
mention now and um
can this instruction set up great and

668
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,360
can this instruction set up great and
 

669
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,710
can this instruction set up great and
breaking changes to the account so

670
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720
breaking changes to the account so
 

671
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,629
breaking changes to the account so
that's really

672
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:26,639
that's really
 

673
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,870

there is one question meteor from ivan
yeah i do have one

680
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:36,880
yeah i do have one
 

681
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,389
yeah i do have one
uh

682
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
uh
 

683
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,069
uh
let me just one second

684
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:40,079
let me just one second
 

685
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,990
let me just one second
uh yeah so

686
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
uh yeah so
 

687
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,310
uh yeah so
the the question is about uh the

688
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
the the question is about uh the
 

689
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,150
the the question is about uh the
compression so

690
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,160
compression so
 

691
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,949
compression so
uh

692
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
uh
 

693
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,350
uh
we know that as for now there are

694
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:49,360
we know that as for now there are
 

695
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,710
we know that as for now there are
certain limits on the gps you know my

696
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
certain limits on the gps you know my
 

697
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,470
certain limits on the gps you know my
net and we know that compression will

698
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
net and we know that compression will
 

699
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,590
net and we know that compression will
remove this limits for some extent

700
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,600
remove this limits for some extent
 

701
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,389
remove this limits for some extent
so the question is to what extent so

702
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
so the question is to what extent so
 

703
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,110
so the question is to what extent so
what what will be the new limits on tps

704
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
what what will be the new limits on tps
 

705
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,190
what what will be the new limits on tps
on the mainland

706
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
on the mainland
 

707
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,230
on the mainland
i don't know about limits on on tps

708
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,240
i don't know about limits on on tps
 

709
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,550
i don't know about limits on on tps
there are some mechanisms that are

710
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:12,560
there are some mechanisms that are
 

711
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,910
there are some mechanisms that are
preventing you to go over certain

712
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
preventing you to go over certain
 

713
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,949
preventing you to go over certain
limits but

714
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959

 

715
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,269

it it was done for the compatibility

716
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
it it was done for the compatibility
 

717
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,949
it it was done for the compatibility
mode and um there is there is

718
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
mode and um there is there is
 

719
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,990
mode and um there is there is
like the biggest limit is the gas

720
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,000
like the biggest limit is the gas
 

721
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,389
like the biggest limit is the gas
limit on the block and the gas limit on

722
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
limit on the block and the gas limit on
 

723
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,030
limit on the block and the gas limit on
the block will remain like that for some

724
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
the block will remain like that for some
 

725
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,550
the block will remain like that for some
time

726
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
time
 

727
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,470
time
okay so so the compression the

728
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
okay so so the compression the
 

729
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,910
okay so so the compression the
compression will make it

730
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
compression will make it
 

731
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,430
compression will make it
no the compression

732
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
no the compression
 

733
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,870
no the compression
does does something right uh of course

734
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
does does something right uh of course
 

735
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,670
does does something right uh of course
making less traffic by a lot

736
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:45,680
making less traffic by a lot
 

737
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,550

uh

738
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
uh
 

739
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,550
uh
but um but in terms of uh we are not

740
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
but um but in terms of uh we are not
 

741
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,790
but um but in terms of uh we are not
optimizing for tps now into you need to

742
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
optimizing for tps now into you need to
 

743
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,470
optimizing for tps now into you need to
kind of we are not we don't see the

744
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:55,480
kind of we are not we don't see the
 

745
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,509
kind of we are not we don't see the
necessity for

746
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:57,519
necessity for
 

747
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,590
necessity for
right now the speeding up the tps this

748
00:13:59,590 --> 00:13:59,600
right now the speeding up the tps this
 

749
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,550
right now the speeding up the tps this
is not our concern our concern right now

750
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
is not our concern our concern right now
 

751
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,430
is not our concern our concern right now
is safely introduce all the changes that

752
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,440
is safely introduce all the changes that
 

753
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,110
is safely introduce all the changes that
we need to introduce

754
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,120
we need to introduce
 

755
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,870
we need to introduce
including the new algorithms like ramp

756
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
including the new algorithms like ramp
 

757
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,430

00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
so then to make it in the safely fashion
 

763
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,949
so then to make it in the safely fashion
um on the main net and that take it will

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,430
well once it happens
we will deal with that and maybe

790
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:49,440
we will deal with that and maybe
 

791
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,110
we will deal with that and maybe
switching priority right now the

792
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,120
switching priority right now the
 

793
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,590

the unlimited tps basically
and with also with the necessary

804
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
and with also with the necessary
 

805
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,629
and with also with the necessary
security so before we so i hope

806
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
security so before we so i hope
 

807
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,470
security so before we so i hope
there won't be any

suddenly deal with 10 000 tps tomorrow
but if it happens well we will deal with

820
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
but if it happens well we will deal with
 

821
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,870
but if it happens well we will deal with

a small question about uh your

828
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
a small question about uh your
 

829
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,829
a small question about uh your
expectations on when we are going to

830
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:31,839
expectations on when we are going to
 

831
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,710
expectations on when we are going to
introduce the ramp and the new consensus

832
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
introduce the ramp and the new consensus
 

833
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,269
introduce the ramp and the new consensus
should we wait for for example middle of

834
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:37,279
should we wait for for example middle of
 

835
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,509
should we wait for for example middle of
summer or end of summer or will it be

836
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
summer or end of summer or will it be
 

837
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,829
summer or end of summer or will it be
faster how do you see

838
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
faster how do you see
 

839
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,069
faster how do you see
well ramp isn't testing now internal

840
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,079
well ramp isn't testing now internal
 

841
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,470
well ramp isn't testing now internal
internal dates for release of ramp is

842
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:46,480
internal dates for release of ramp is
 

843
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,509
internal dates for release of ramp is
may

844
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
may
 

845
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,590
may
um but you know

846
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
um but you know
 

847
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,030
um but you know
that is something

848
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040
that is something
 

849
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,030
that is something
you know if everything just goes kind of

850
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
you know if everything just goes kind of
 

851
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,870
you know if everything just goes kind of
smooth and we don't see a huge amount of

852
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
smooth and we don't see a huge amount of
 

853
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,069
smooth and we don't see a huge amount of
bugs uncovering themselves in the next

854
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:58,079
bugs uncovering themselves in the next
 

855
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,230
bugs uncovering themselves in the next
two three weeks on the test

856
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,240
two three weeks on the test
 

857
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,430
two three weeks on the test
okay so the answer is basically soon

858
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
okay so the answer is basically soon
 

859
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,749
okay so the answer is basically soon
well what do you want

860
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:05,759
well what do you want
 

861
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,269
well what do you want
longer

862
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:11,279

 

863
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,749

later coin by the way can be

864
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
later coin by the way can be
 

865
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,910
later coin by the way can be
like the next big idea

866
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:15,920
like the next big idea
 

867
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,470
like the next big idea
yeah so the there are some reasons why

868
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
yeah so the there are some reasons why
 

869
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,949
yeah so the there are some reasons why
i'm asking that i'm not just uh came

870
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:20,959
i'm asking that i'm not just uh came
 

871
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,269
i'm asking that i'm not just uh came
here and asking that because i want to

872
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
here and asking that because i want to
 

873
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,670
here and asking that because i want to
ask there are some reasons but yeah we

874
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
ask there are some reasons but yeah we
 

875
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,069
ask there are some reasons but yeah we
are ready to wait

876
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:28,079
are ready to wait
 

877
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,749
are ready to wait
well again the the ramp is implemented

878
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:31,759
well again the the ramp is implemented
 

879
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,350
well again the the ramp is implemented
it's in testing that's a very

880
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
it's in testing that's a very
 

881
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,590
it's in testing that's a very
complicated protocol

882
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600
complicated protocol
 

883
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,590
complicated protocol
you need to understand ramp is really

884
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:37,600
you need to understand ramp is really
 

885
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,670
you need to understand ramp is really
complicated protocol it's the most

886
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:39,680
complicated protocol it's the most
 

887
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,430
complicated protocol it's the most
complicated protocol that is in the

888
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,440
complicated protocol that is in the
 

889
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,189
complicated protocol that is in the
network right now it's more complicated

890
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199
network right now it's more complicated
 

891
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,870
network right now it's more complicated
than cat chain it's more complicated

892
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
than cat chain it's more complicated
 

893
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,389
than cat chain it's more complicated
than than consensus it's more

894
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:46,399
than than consensus it's more
 

895
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,150
than than consensus it's more
complicated than anything that has been

896
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
complicated than anything that has been
 

897
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,749
complicated than anything that has been
introduced up so far

898
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
introduced up so far
 

899
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,590
introduced up so far
so it's a really complicated piece of

900
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:51,600
so it's a really complicated piece of
 

901
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,910
so it's a really complicated piece of
fake way whatever

902
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:53,920
fake way whatever
 

903
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,310
fake way whatever
and uh and

904
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:56,320
and uh and
 

905
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,110
and uh and
and we it's a lot of things

906
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
and we it's a lot of things
 

907
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,910
and we it's a lot of things
you know happening

908
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
you know happening
 

909
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,749
you know happening
the bugs that

910
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:03,759
the bugs that
 

911
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,429
the bugs that
certain you know

912
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
certain you know
 

913
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,029
certain you know
implementation issues and stuff like

914
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:07,039
implementation issues and stuff like
 

915
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,270
implementation issues and stuff like
that so yeah

916
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:09,280
that so yeah
 

917
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,069
that so yeah
but in the the another problem with rem

918
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079
but in the the another problem with rem
 

919
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,429
but in the the another problem with rem
is that ram cannot be introduced

920
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:13,439
is that ram cannot be introduced
 

921
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,470
is that ram cannot be introduced
gradually

922
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
gradually
 

923
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,549
gradually
we cannot have both

924
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:16,559
we cannot have both
 

925
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,429
we cannot have both
old

926
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:17,439
old
 

927
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,029
old
external messages can damp

928
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
external messages can damp
 

929
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,949
external messages can damp
simultaneously on the same network we

930
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
simultaneously on the same network we
 

931
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,470
simultaneously on the same network we
cannot do that

932
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,480
cannot do that
 

933
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,949
cannot do that
so ramp is a switch

934
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
so ramp is a switch
 

935
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,750
so ramp is a switch
on off kind of switch so once we move to

936
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
on off kind of switch so once we move to
 

937
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,310
on off kind of switch so once we move to
ramp there is no

938
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,320
ramp there is no
 

939
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,710
ramp there is no
no kind of well we can roll back of

940
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
no kind of well we can roll back of
 

941
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,110
no kind of well we can roll back of
course but that's that's all we can and

942
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,120
course but that's that's all we can and
 

943
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,190
course but that's that's all we can and
we don't obviously want to do that so

944
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,200
we don't obviously want to do that so
 

945
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,789
we don't obviously want to do that so
that's that additional kind of

946
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
that's that additional kind of
 

947
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,470
that's that additional kind of
constraint of how

948
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
constraint of how
 

949
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,150
constraint of how
well we should test rim before we

950
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,160
well we should test rim before we
 

951
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,350
well we should test rim before we
introduce it let's be tested really well

952
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,360
introduce it let's be tested really well
 

953
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,350
introduce it let's be tested really well

uh so first one is uh what uh is called
 

997
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,350
uh so first one is uh what uh is called
the universal bridge so but before doing

998
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
the universal bridge so but before doing
 

999
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,789
the universal bridge so but before doing
this so um i won't just say that we now

1000
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:42,799
this so um i won't just say that we now
 

1001
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,029
this so um i won't just say that we now
have a very beautiful landing pages that

1002
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
have a very beautiful landing pages that
 

1003
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,669
have a very beautiful landing pages that
we are proud of so it was a really

1004
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:47,679
we are proud of so it was a really
 

1005
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,909
we are proud of so it was a really
really uh whole process to collect all

1006
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
really uh whole process to collect all
 

1007
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,470
really uh whole process to collect all
the info and uh test against different

1008
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,480
the info and uh test against different
 

1009
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,590
the info and uh test against different
stakeholders so but finally we have it

1010
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:55,600
stakeholders so but finally we have it
 

1011
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,270
stakeholders so but finally we have it
yeah a small

1012
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
yeah a small
 

1013
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,830
yeah a small
internal wing i hope you love it

1014
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840
internal wing i hope you love it
 

1015
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,310
internal wing i hope you love it
uh so actually what uh let me tell you

1016
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:02,320
uh so actually what uh let me tell you
 

1017
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,150
uh so actually what uh let me tell you
about the universal bridge because it's

1018
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,160
about the universal bridge because it's
 

1019
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,830
about the universal bridge because it's
something really huge

1020
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:05,840
something really huge
 

1021
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,190
something really huge
that was uh

1022
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200
that was uh
 

1023
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,029
that was uh
launched it it doesn't seem to be like

1024
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,039
launched it it doesn't seem to be like
 

1025
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,510
launched it it doesn't seem to be like
this but believe me it is really a game

1026
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
this but believe me it is really a game
 

1027
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,510
this but believe me it is really a game
changer for

1028
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:13,520
changer for
 

1029
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,830
changer for
many many businesses

1030
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:17,840

 

1031
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,789

oh

1032
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
oh
 

1033
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,950
oh
what was that sounded like a

1034
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:20,960
what was that sounded like a
 

1035
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,710
what was that sounded like a
i don't want to say

1036
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,720
i don't want to say
 

1037
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,310
i don't want to say
yes

1038
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:24,320
yes
 

1039
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,669
yes
so and uh for all the businesses uh

1040
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:27,679
so and uh for all the businesses uh
 

1041
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,190
so and uh for all the businesses uh
that are running cross chain so and um

1042
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,200
that are running cross chain so and um
 

1043
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,029
that are running cross chain so and um
what actually it does

1044
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:33,039
what actually it does
 

1045
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,870
what actually it does
is that uh it allows you to transfer uh

1046
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,880
is that uh it allows you to transfer uh
 

1047
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,590
is that uh it allows you to transfer uh
any token uh

1048
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
any token uh
 

1049
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,190
any token uh
without whitelisting it in the bridge so

1050
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,200
without whitelisting it in the bridge so
 

1051
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,510
without whitelisting it in the bridge so
that's that's easy so you just need to

1052
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,520
that's that's easy so you just need to
 

1053
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,830
that's that's easy so you just need to
import the token and uh

1054
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840
import the token and uh
 

1055
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,750
import the token and uh
then you go so you can transfer it to to

1056
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:49,760
then you go so you can transfer it to to
 

1057
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,669
then you go so you can transfer it to to
everscale

1058
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:51,679
everscale
 

1059
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,590
everscale
and from fsk by the way to other

1060
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:53,600
and from fsk by the way to other
 

1061
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,590
and from fsk by the way to other
networks as well so we do not support

1062
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600
networks as well so we do not support
 

1063
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,270
networks as well so we do not support
the hidden bridge for universal breach

appear soon but maybe let me show you
 

1077
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,870
appear soon but maybe let me show you
how it works so uh let's choose any

1078
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880
how it works so uh let's choose any
 

1079
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,750
how it works so uh let's choose any
chain oh maybe let's do it better so uh

1080
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:15,760
chain oh maybe let's do it better so uh
 

1081
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,549
chain oh maybe let's do it better so uh
let's take any token from uh coin market

1082
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:18,559
let's take any token from uh coin market
 

1083
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,149
let's take any token from uh coin market
cap so anything that's uh on

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,510

so copy address

1090
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,520
so copy address
 

1091
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,549
so copy address
so as it is on the ethereum so we select

1092
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
so as it is on the ethereum so we select
 

1093
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,470
so as it is on the ethereum so we select
ethereum here

1094
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:36,480
ethereum here
 

1095
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,750

the everstart launchpad so and we have
 

1219
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,870
the everstart launchpad so and we have
put there uh

1220

put there uh
 

1221
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,950
put there uh
some amount of cube tokens uh to see the

some amount of cube tokens uh to see the
 

1223
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,590
some amount of cube tokens uh to see the
interest in those tokens and how how the

of course uh
 

1243
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,950
of course uh
we have took only

1244
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:40,960
we have took only
 

1245
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,950
we have took only
the hard cap and then we

1246
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:42,960
the hard cap and then we
 

1247
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,149
the hard cap and then we
uh ritually burned it uh just to show

1248
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:46,159
uh ritually burned it uh just to show
 

1249
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,789
uh ritually burned it uh just to show
that uh this was a really marketing

1250
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:48,799
that uh this was a really marketing
 

1251
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,269
that uh this was a really marketing
campaign and nothing else it was not in

1252
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:51,279
campaign and nothing else it was not in
 

1253
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,149
campaign and nothing else it was not in
token sale or anything of this kind but

1254
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,159
token sale or anything of this kind but
 

1255
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,029
token sale or anything of this kind but
the uh happy we had the participants of

1256
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:57,039
the uh happy we had the participants of
 

1257
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,909
the uh happy we had the participants of
the launch pad will be getting uh

1258
00:23:59,909 --> 00:23:59,919
the launch pad will be getting uh
 

1259
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,430
the launch pad will be getting uh
the

1260
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:01,440
the
 

1261
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,110
the
the tokens according to the veterans

1262
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,120
the tokens according to the veterans
 

1263
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,190
the tokens according to the veterans
so

1264
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,200

 

1265
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,630

i will share with you now the

1266
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:12,640
i will share with you now the
 

1267
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,510
i will share with you now the
few ideas about what cube token is

1268
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:15,520
few ideas about what cube token is
 

1269
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,710
few ideas about what cube token is
because

1270
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:16,720
because
 

1271
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,669
because
many of you have asked this question and

1272
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:19,679
many of you have asked this question and
 

1273
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,870
many of you have asked this question and
so uh here's the one pager of

1274
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:22,880
so uh here's the one pager of
 

1275
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,230
so uh here's the one pager of
um

1276
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,240
um
 

1277
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,310
um
uh of the cube token so actually uh

1278
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,320
uh of the cube token so actually uh
 

1279
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,510
uh of the cube token so actually uh
what cube is uh going to

1280
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:31,520
what cube is uh going to
 

1281
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,190
what cube is uh going to
to introduce on flat cube is a really

1282
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,200
to introduce on flat cube is a really
 

1283
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,630
to introduce on flat cube is a really
big set of new mechanics that are really

1284
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:38,640
big set of new mechanics that are really
 

1285
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,870
big set of new mechanics that are really
something uh novel to the market and

1286
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:42,880
something uh novel to the market and
 

1287
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,070
something uh novel to the market and
some of them are really

1288
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,080
some of them are really
 

1289
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,230
some of them are really
only getting started to use by by major

1290
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,240
only getting started to use by by major
 

1291
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,789
only getting started to use by by major
protocols so uh

1292
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:50,799
protocols so uh
 

1293
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,789
protocols so uh
i will not stop on on this because these

1294
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:52,799
i will not stop on on this because these
 

1295
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,630
i will not stop on on this because these
are these ones are obvious but i'd

1296
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:54,640
are these ones are obvious but i'd
 

1297
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,789
are these ones are obvious but i'd
rather go directly to the

1298
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:56,799
rather go directly to the
 

1299
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,190
rather go directly to the
token distribution schedule so now the

1300
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200
token distribution schedule so now the
 

1301
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,190
token distribution schedule so now the
first emission of cubes is 2 million

1302
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,200
first emission of cubes is 2 million
 

1303
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,789
first emission of cubes is 2 million
tokens and

1304
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:02,799
tokens and
 

1305
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,549
tokens and
you see there is a distribution of what

1306
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:04,559
you see there is a distribution of what
 

1307
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,870
you see there is a distribution of what
was going on so and to the launch pad it

1308
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:06,880
was going on so and to the launch pad it
 

1309
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,149
was going on so and to the launch pad it
was

1310
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:08,159
was
 

1311
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,630
was
only a small amount gone

1312
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:10,640
only a small amount gone
 

1313
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,750
only a small amount gone
and the other part so this is a three

1314
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:13,760
and the other part so this is a three
 

1315
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,590
and the other part so this is a three
percent of the total emission which will

1316
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:15,600
percent of the total emission which will
 

1317
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,310
percent of the total emission which will
reach 65 million cubes

1318
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320
reach 65 million cubes
 

1319
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,990
reach 65 million cubes
uh and uh

1320
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,000
uh and uh
 

1321
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,510
uh and uh
all the rest of the emission will

1322
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:21,520
all the rest of the emission will
 

1323
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,789
all the rest of the emission will
gradually uh be released uh in line with

1324
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:24,799
gradually uh be released uh in line with
 

1325
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,990
gradually uh be released uh in line with
this curve so starting from the sixth

1326
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,000
this curve so starting from the sixth
 

1327
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,870
this curve so starting from the sixth
month

1328
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:28,880
month
 

1329
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,590
month
so from the date of the cube launch so

1330
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:31,600
so from the date of the cube launch so
 

1331
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,789
so from the date of the cube launch so
meaning that

1332
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:32,799
meaning that
 

1333
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,789
meaning that
for this six months the emission will

1334
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:34,799
for this six months the emission will
 

1335
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,510
for this six months the emission will
become will be stable and then uh over

1336
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:37,520
become will be stable and then uh over
 

1337
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,990
become will be stable and then uh over
the period of 48 months so it will be

1338
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,000
the period of 48 months so it will be
 

1339
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,630
the period of 48 months so it will be
gradually released with

1340
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:42,640
gradually released with
 

1341
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,029
gradually released with
somewhat increased speed

1342
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:45,039
somewhat increased speed
 

1343
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,789
somewhat increased speed
uh

1344
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:46,799
uh
 

1345
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,549
uh
the cube

1346
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:48,559
the cube
 

1347
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,029
the cube
in q3 we are going to release what we

1348
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:51,039
in q3 we are going to release what we

deceived so uh but actually the the the
 

1357
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,630
deceived so uh but actually the the the
thing is very easy uh big cubes will be

1358
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:04,640
thing is very easy uh big cubes will be
 

1359
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,350
thing is very easy uh big cubes will be
used to

1360
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,360
used to

farms so minions there for example if
you are going to run a farm with your

1370
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:19,919
you are going to run a farm with your
 

1371
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,070
you are going to run a farm with your
token launched on flat cube

1372
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,080
token launched on flat cube
 

1373
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,430
token launched on flat cube
uh then you can uh go to to the gauche

1374
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,440
uh then you can uh go to to the gauche
 

1375
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,310
uh then you can uh go to to the gauche
and vote for allocating a certain amount

1376
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,320
and vote for allocating a certain amount
 

1377
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,710
and vote for allocating a certain amount
of cubes so your farm is about so means

1378
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:30,720
of cubes so your farm is about so means
 

1379
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,669
of cubes so your farm is about so means
that besides uh your tokens farming so

1380
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:33,679
that besides uh your tokens farming so
 

1381
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,909
that besides uh your tokens farming so
you will get also the allocation from

1382
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:35,919
you will get also the allocation from
 

1383
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,430
you will get also the allocation from
flat cube as well

1384
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:37,440
flat cube as well
 

1385
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,590
flat cube as well
so and this is some somewhat that's a

1386
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:39,600
so and this is some somewhat that's a
 

1387
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,269
so and this is some somewhat that's a
proven uh

1388
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:41,279
proven uh
 

1389
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,029

at least if you essentially better read

1442
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:40,159
at least if you essentially better read
 

1443
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,510
at least if you essentially better read
it

1444

it
 

1445
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,350
it
and it worked really well it was

1446
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:43,360
and it worked really well it was
 

1447
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,230

concisely quick does anybody have any

1448
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:46,240
concisely quick does anybody have any
 

1449
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,070
concisely quick does anybody have any
questions for uh vlad before we move on

1450
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,080
questions for uh vlad before we move on
 

1451
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,190
questions for uh vlad before we move on
yeah so basically it's curve right

1452
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,200
yeah so basically it's curve right
 

1453
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,110
yeah so basically it's curve right
yeah yeah so this is really similar to

1454
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,120
yeah yeah so this is really similar to
 

1455
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,470
yeah yeah so this is really similar to
curve and

1456
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:56,480
curve and
 

1457
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,470
curve and
so what they are doing but it's not only

1458
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:58,480
so what they are doing but it's not only
 

1459
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,750
so what they are doing but it's not only
curved because

1460
00:27:59,750 --> 00:27:59,760
curved because
 

1461
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,950
curved because
our guys

1462
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:00,960
our guys
 

1463
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,710
our guys
constantly monitoring different defy

1464
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:02,720
constantly monitoring different defy
 

1465
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,269
constantly monitoring different defy
protocols what they are doing if there

1466
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:05,279
protocols what they are doing if there
 

1467
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,909
protocols what they are doing if there
are anything that we believe will be

1468
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:07,919
are anything that we believe will be
 

1469
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,029
are anything that we believe will be
successful uh we also

1470
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:11,039
successful uh we also
 

1471
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,230
successful uh we also
see how we can implement this uh in flat

1472
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:14,240
see how we can implement this uh in flat
 

1473
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,389
see how we can implement this uh in flat
cube and also think about

1474
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:16,399
cube and also think about
 

1475
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:22,149
cube and also think about
our own unique features

when i first was introduced to crypto
 

1561
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,590
when i first was introduced to crypto
world uh uh it took about three months

1562
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:11,600
world uh uh it took about three months
 

1563
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,990
world uh uh it took about three months
to understand what it's all about and

1564

price of transactions which is not

1700
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:09,039
price of transactions which is not
 

1701
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,389
price of transactions which is not
expensive at all

1702
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:10,399
expensive at all
 

1703
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,549
expensive at all
uh by the way the speeds are not good at

1704
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:12,559
uh by the way the speeds are not good at
 

1705
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,430
uh by the way the speeds are not good at

how to do this uh we check transactions
 

1787
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,950
how to do this uh we check transactions
on polygon scan and track what

1788

uh
 

1801
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,030
uh
one of the first steps of course is

1802
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,040
one of the first steps of course is
 

1803
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,150
one of the first steps of course is
installing the wallet in our case with

1804
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,160
installing the wallet in our case with
 

1805
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,390
installing the wallet in our case with
polygonquest it was a metamask wallet

1806
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:18,400
polygonquest it was a metamask wallet
 

1807
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,790
polygonquest it was a metamask wallet
and we need to switch it from method to

1808
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:20,800
and we need to switch it from method to
 

1809
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,270
and we need to switch it from method to
polygon and without explaining the user

1810
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:23,280
polygon and without explaining the user
 

1811
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,750

what he is to do because it's too

1812
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:25,760
what he is to do because it's too
 

1813
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,790
what he is to do because it's too
difficult for our crypto naive users to

1814
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:28,800
difficult for our crypto naive users to
 

1815
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,750
difficult for our crypto naive users to
get the idea of networks and blockchains

1816
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:31,760
get the idea of networks and blockchains
 

1817
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,990
get the idea of networks and blockchains
and different blockchains etc

1818
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,000
and different blockchains etc
 

1819
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,150
and different blockchains etc
and we give

1820
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,160
and we give
 

1821
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,230
and we give
them our users players the idea of how

1822
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:40,240
them our users players the idea of how
 

1823
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,150
them our users players the idea of how
money comes in and what is the

1824
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,160
money comes in and what is the
 

1825
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,550
money comes in and what is the
transaction what is that drop and we

1826
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:44,560
transaction what is that drop and we
 

1827
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,470
transaction what is that drop and we
make them to make their first

1828
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:46,480
make them to make their first
 

1829
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,750
make them to make their first
transaction with the airdrop tokens to

1830
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:49,760
transaction with the airdrop tokens to
 

1831
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,710
transaction with the airdrop tokens to
get this really hands-on experience

1832
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:52,720
get this really hands-on experience
 

1833
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,630
get this really hands-on experience
of uh money comes in from the end money

1834
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:56,640
of uh money comes in from the end money
 

1835
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,950
of uh money comes in from the end money
goes into the air and someone receives

1836
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:58,960
goes into the air and someone receives
 

1837
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,510
goes into the air and someone receives
it and there is something else happens

1838

it and there is something else happens
 

1839
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,430
it and there is something else happens
after uh afterwards

1840
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:03,440
after uh afterwards
 

1841
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,430
after uh afterwards
and everything is uh tracked and

1842
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:05,440
and everything is uh tracked and
 

1843
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,470

before and
 

2711
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,910
before and
now we can put it on on ground bazaar

2712
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:19,920
now we can put it on on ground bazaar
 

2713
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,150
now we can put it on on ground bazaar
and see it on the ground bazaar

2714
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:24,160
and see it on the ground bazaar
 

2715
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,510
and see it on the ground bazaar
well something like that

2716
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:27,520
well something like that

3252
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:08,240
before the call began and here's the
 

3253
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,829
before the call began and here's the
answer that it got

3254
01:06:09,829 --> 01:06:09,839
answer that it got
 

3255
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:12,950
answer that it got
uh the last batch was sent out on march

3256
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:12,960
uh the last batch was sent out on march

01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:32,070
but you'll be able to uh manifest it in
a in a metaverse so um it's pretty cool

3380
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:32,080
a in a metaverse so um it's pretty cool
 

3381
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,829
a in a metaverse so um it's pretty cool
and and given you know the conditions

3382
01:08:33,829 --> 01:08:33,839
and and given you know the conditions
 

3383
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:35,669
and and given you know the conditions
that we're living under and the

3384
01:08:35,669 --> 01:08:35,679
that we're living under and the
 

3385
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,590
that we're living under and the
restrictive travel and everything else

3386
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:37,600
restrictive travel and everything else
 

3387
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,430
restrictive travel and everything else
um i think it's the perfect solution i

3388
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:39,440
um i think it's the perfect solution i
 

3389
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,030
um i think it's the perfect solution i
think it's gonna be really cool i mean

3390
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:41,040
think it's gonna be really cool i mean
 

3391
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,470
think it's gonna be really cool i mean
obviously you won't be able to hook up

3392
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:42,480
obviously you won't be able to hook up
 

3393
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,390
obviously you won't be able to hook up
with anybody but

3394

01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,789
with anybody but
well you could but

3396
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:46,799
well you could but
 

3397
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:48,630
well you could but
right in front of you so there you go so

3398
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:48,640
right in front of you so there you go so
 

3399
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,630
right in front of you so there you go so
you can e-hook up any anywhere by the

3400
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:50,640
you can e-hook up any anywhere by the
 

3401
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,550
you can e-hook up any anywhere by the
way that's kind of like the trend these

3402
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:52,560
way that's kind of like the trend these
 

3403
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,309
way that's kind of like the trend these
days you know that right

3404
01:08:54,309 --> 01:08:54,319
days you know that right
 

3405
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,870
days you know that right
especially in asian asian countries

3406
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:56,880
especially in asian asian countries
 

3407
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,149
especially in asian asian countries
parts of the world

3408
01:08:58,149 --> 01:08:58,159
parts of the world
 

3409
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:00,390
parts of the world
so there you go you'll know all about it

3410
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:00,400
so there you go you'll know all about it
 

3411

idea it's gonna be an ever scale party
 

3421
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:15,990
idea it's gonna be an ever scale party
in a metaverse so that's being worked on

3422
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:16,000
in a metaverse so that's being worked on
 

3423
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,910
in a metaverse so that's being worked on
and um and like i said it looks pretty

3424
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:17,920
and um and like i said it looks pretty

the question to me
is a little juvenile

3452
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:50,560
is a little juvenile
 

3453
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:55,350
is a little juvenile
i mean

3454
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:55,360

 

3455
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,830

short of

idea and how to return those tokens is

3462
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:02,560
idea and how to return those tokens is
 

3463
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,229
idea and how to return those tokens is
there is there a way to do that

3464
01:10:04,229 --> 01:10:04,239
there is there a way to do that
 

3465

i would say that any organization
that received tokens

3470
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:11,360
that received tokens
 

3471
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,510
that received tokens

that that's chump change in the big
 

3531
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,110
that that's chump change in the big
world and the question would be was it

3532

world and the question would be was it
 

3533
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,870
world and the question would be was it
worth it and if it wasn't worth it find

3534
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:20,880
worth it and if it wasn't worth it find
 

3535
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,350
worth it and if it wasn't worth it find
a way to return it because that would do

3536
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:23,360
a way to return it because that would do
 

3537
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,030
