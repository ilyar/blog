there we go a couple more
[Music]
just one more minute normally we have a
few more people
yes it should remind
waiting for my new one unfortunately the
guy that could get it to me is uh
is on a plane
all right well um we're live so i guess
anyone joining us a little
late um we'll be able to watch us on
youtube so
let's um let's get started uh hi welcome
to everscale community call number 98.
so we're
two away from the big one hundo the big
one zero zero wow it's uh
interesting uh
been a long time been uh been a lot of
ups and downs and at the end you know
we're pushing right through everything
so many new use cases so many new things
going on
just
excited i guess a little bit um
uh welcome uh we're gonna have only uh
basically uh two new presentations today
but the both of them are pretty pretty
darn cool um so the call should go
pretty swiftly we have a presentation
for ever rangers
we have a presentation for
uh everscale poker tournaments
so yeah i mean interesting stuff uh but
before we get to that i'm gonna go ahead
and uh annoy everybody like i usually do
at the beginning and uh be repetitive
and a broken record and just sort of go
through the tidbits of call etiquette
uh please uh
uh
turn your cameras on unless you know
you're waiting for a proctologist to put
on his glove or something like that
uh
uh please save your questions reminds
right
when you're over 40 buddy you got to do
it
uh
please uh save your questions until each
presenter is finished with their
presentation uh use the raise your hand
feature in zoom i beg of you please uh
if you're one of our beloved youtube
guests there's a comment section you can
write your questions in there we'll get
to them at the very end of the call
and uh of course as always the call is
conducted in english so let's begin with
uh mita like we always do for the latest
technical information so meet you if
you're ready
please
dear me today yes hi
yes um
yeah okay so um
for the technical stuff so where um
some of you may kind of uh feel
the pain of the
the devnet
and
so we have a unstable
devnet currently
and that's because
someone
wrote a very interesting contract
which
which is doing some nasty nasty things
to the network and
that allows us to
to debug certain certain things
that we didn't think we will need to
right now
so um
so we're doing that and um
like
this is on top of the patches that we
planned to
and deployed there so we deployed
patches that we need to test in order to
upgrade mainnet
we've
then we've we kind of faced this problem
with the with the
contracts and some contracts on the
devnet
started to fix this
so
created more instability the network
halted today
during our tests
for some 20 minutes or something
um we've been able to restore it
and we'll continue to
apply certain patches
um it's a it's a general like these
things are
[Music]
kind of
deficiencies in the original
architecture
that
just
just uh weren't yet fixed and
they're they're
located at the edges of the
uh
of the platform
like very deep
uh kind of for example very deep uh
trees
sell trees and so on
um
and that that imposed some limits on the
on the block collation
uh which fails and so on and so um
with
it's hard things to think to fix because
it is um
usually like this kind of changes should
be
structurally
planned ahead
but because it happens right now we
cannot plan ahead so we have to fix it
now and that's what we are doing
but it's kind of hectic a little bit
so
that's basically it it delays our plans
on main net upgrade because of this
because we cannot test properly without
fixing the devnet first
so again this this cumulative patches
switch up which a huge patch already
by itself uh
will be even larger
now and obviously
you know
i'm kind of looking at it
philosophically because sooner or later
we would need to do that anyway
but uh
[Music]
it never happened in real life like it
never happens in the
in the
timing that you think you need it to
happen right it's just events of real
real life
um so yeah so that's what we're doing
and because of that because we couldn't
update
upgrade
this the network in a planned fashion
like we did the upgrades but we couldn't
um patch them
in time we're delaying the
uh obviously the things that we had to
do in the first quarter which is the
decrease of fees
the gas fees and uh because we cannot do
that before we move to the to before we
apply all the patches that we worked on
so
so once we do then then we will go and
and deal with the gas fees
so more or less that's the status
uh there is a question i think ron posed
me yeah
dark rules something yeah i mean uh the
question is basically and uh i had to
paraphrase it so it's uh what's better
you know i don't think you can answer
that but uh what's better or what will
be launched first uh is it going to be
boosted staking or dark pools and then
of course when and i think when they're
talking about boost staking they're
talking about version two i mean i can
answer that when it's voted on but uh
yeah i mean
one's uh technically technically
i don't think it's a question to me
because uh
dark foods and boosted sticking are not
one or another dark pool is a technology
booster staking is
an outcome
how do you achieve boosted staking it's
another
completely another question
the dark pools
as i said they are they already
uh they have been the code has been
published in kwpc
uh repositories
so if you want to use them
you are welcome to do so
um
they have been like audited
and
apart from that
you can also like they are interesting
because you can see there
that the codes in both um
also solidity so like it's it's a more
more strictly more
verified language
to start from
[Music]
which solidity was then translated too
and um
so yeah
you can you can
you can use this if you want
and the governance can can use them if
the government wants to
and uh to
you know to use them in any way or
fashion and that will
may include the boosted staking and you
can stake in what what is what is uh
dark pool is a you take
something for for the period of certain
years or whatever
and then you have a grace period in
which someone else like the governance
can can put a
second leg
like put the boost into your
stake
that's it
and so
so you can
you can use this contracts to to do
whatever you want in terms of like
farming or boosted whatever you call it
but i know there are other boosted
staking
kind of contracts i have no idea how
they done because i never it's not
something that i did
so no idea maybe there are other
contracts that you can use for booster
staking again the decision is
like the governor's decision
whatever
program
they want to launch when
they
bottom line the technical ability they
have the technical ability to do it now
the rest is like if if someone if from
the governance will come and say
like help us to launch a dark pool uh
for that program we will gladly do that
thank you okay i hope that answers your
question whoever you were
i wrote it in um are there any questions
for me too
okay
all right let's move on to our next
presenter who's none other than alexei
darkwing
uh he's here with us uh to talk about
a project called ever rangers uh which
is a
quick and safe token exchange platform
that's what i um that's what i was told
i don't know much more about it uh i'm
actually very interested in finding out
more because
because it was thrown at me just you
know a week ago i looked at the landing
page looks good but i want to know a lot
more about it um the original i should
mention the original presenter had a had
a personal emergency literally uh 40
minutes ago so
what darkwing is going to do is sort of
just go through the slides uh read the
information uh you know answer any
questions that he's capable of answering
but for the most part i think that
the the the team that developed it will
actually
uh be able to answer that at a later
time if i'm not mistaken but yeah uh
darkwing
podiums george yep uh hello everybody uh
can you hear me yes yes
we can here
uh so yes due to some family emergency
uh the leader of this project alexey
norwick cannot join us uh today that's
why i will tell you more about
everest
scale terrace blockchain bridge
so um this breach was
uh oh yes you see my screen
yes yes yes we do uh
great uh so uh this project was created
uh during the by the way
sorry during the
desert hackathon and
uh so let's uh let me explain uh you
so uh first of all why could users need
debris
uh
for example users has token never skate
status it's an organization that helps
people in different hard situations to
do this uh we need to exchange
our tokens to test tokens and that's why
we need bridge
also users from both systems could be
able to use services from both systems
buy sell games and so on
another and i think one of the important
thing it's dex that because on everscale
side there is unique distributex which
is called flex ever serve
and to use these drugs user users need
uh every scale tokens
go to the next slide
uh there are four possible approaches to
to do it since life exchanges but we
need kyc and so on and so on
using
existing taxes like we can
uh
exchange ever i mean yeah a swap ever to
ethereum then from theorem to tennis
also we can use breach with consensus
based approach between participants who
run the briefs affair and locked certain
amounts of funds as insurance in case of
malicious attempts and slashing in case
of proud uh it's not um
it's also good but a high fee
and uh transaction limit based on funds
of participants of the pitch and another
way actually
which is this way it's atomic spa
base bridge
it's complex but it's
very
effective
so uh the algorithm of this bridge that
uh of this bridge that user
with everscale wallet uh sends some
funds to hash time log contract
then with hourly
uh
these funds um
this relay communicate with
teres bridge multisig
and using
hashtag lock contract
based on teddos
we uh transfer the funds from the user
uh i mean we transfer his funds to our
wallet and in exchange he get uh funds
from
from the bridge
so our killer features
bridge software won't receive user
tokens
before the user receives tokens on the
other side of the bridge
two options for bridge implementation
yes
now breach is implemented in two
languages typescript and rust
it's good protection from bugs in the
software and yes it's convenient for
participants i mean breach operators by
the way bridge apparatus it's uh
users
which lock some funds and become yes
bridge operators they are here
uh and each version of the function
bridge software is a multi-sea custodian
yes it's very uh interesting thing that
we have two multisig
uh
in our scale and intestines which we use
to
submit and verify transactions from the
users
uh
yes
it prevents us from some hacks some
failures of one of the servers
and it won't affect system
performance
uh bridge features it
that solve bridge features uh first we
can exchange test talk and to wrap test
tokens we can exchange any tesla's token
to wrap talking to never scale network
and uh on the other way you can exchange
ever to wrap tower and any error scale
token to telescope
yep it's user friendly easy to use and
what is more important at mix web-based
uh more security
and
more securities and open source
uh some difficult difficulties that we
encountered
while implementing the project uh one of
the little problem that
there is no way to attach additional
information with a valid address
uh in every scale to transaction in
tests
i mean that in our scale we have
messages we have payload we can attach
some text and so on in this payload in
tethers actually they don't have such i
don't know predigma
default
contracts that's why we need to use uh
two transactions in the batch but it's
uh
but it's about uh for example we're on
uh one batch and it will do
two operations two transactions and so
on
so what is done now uh two variants of
the off chain relay software actually as
i mentioned before
script and rust uh front and uh mvp
front end and the b uh which be which
will be later announced in the chats of
everscale and now we are on the stage of
testing
checking everything and so on
uh htlc contract on every scale and by
the way now i think on teslas too
um
yeah because uh this presentation was
prepared to the hackathon as i mentioned
before and at this time we don't have a
hoc contract on tedx now
uh roadmap uh
yeah by the way it's a team of this
project and what is more important this
team was uh created fully
during their hackathon uh so now we have
some users which are involved in every
scale in developing another scale and
so on
so roadmap of this project is
eliquidity to support existing tokens
it's about 63 tokens in terms of and a
lot of tokens never scale
implement dow to decisions to some
decisions like add new bridge
update software and so on integrate with
x integrate to
web plus
and
integrate with
service providers so i'll be links for
testing and so on so they will be
officially published and by the way
too
and yes it's ever scale test breach
based on a
atomic swap
paradigm
something like this
thank you very much is that it
yep
okay all right very good uh there were a
couple minute moments so that your
internet went
heyware but that's that's okay it was a
very good presentation thank you very
much for that
uh we have
no that day
you know that it happens we have uh
several questions so first uh ben
please
a uh very simple question for you buddy
um how
soon do you think it will be before a uh
a plebian user such as myself will be
able to use this
i guess uh in a week
this week or maybe the start of the next
week
will be
yes it's a heck of a lot better than
soon
yes it's very i don't i don't like uh
the word soon but yes very
really very very soon uh in a week
okay we have another question from
paddle title please
yes uh thank you for your presentation
uh actually i didn't
get
the point so you said that there are no
hlc contract in texas but
you plan to launch this project
uh yes uh i will make this moment clear
uh when we prepare this
uh presentation uh it was created by the
end of texas a hackathon we don't have
yes uh this contract but now we have and
yes the uh breach can be run only with
uh two uh htlc contracts
yes
okay uh another question that relay
uh is it
some
[Music]
open source software which everybody can
run or how yes how can i
okay
but i can i can become a relay without
trains staking tokens it is just
anyone can run
is it correct
i'm not sure about the
sum of tokens about
which are needed to run uh your bridge
yes i can say for sure that everyone can
run the bridge and
it's open source and will be open source
about their sum of tokens which may be
needed to be locked uh by uh
this bridge operator uh
better to
better maybe to to to ask alfalfa galaxy
yes
in that respect i see that there are no
consensus so any relay can confirm any
operation
um
no
okay
no no
we have uh
if i understand the right we have
multisig and uh
bridge operators uh all bridge operators
they uh when they become rich operators
they become custodians of these uh
custodians of this multistick so to
perform some operations we need for
example
we have 12 breach operators so it's 12
custodians
that means that to
submit
some
transaction we need uh
seven signs or eight signs
to be honest
don't remember
about this
number i mean of
science so to perform some operations we
need to
to reach these consensus and
for example have
paid signs
for
operation
it's very strange
we mean that
you mean you need a number of science
signatures to initiate
transaction but once it is initiated on
one chain then on another chain
it should be
executed automatically
because again it uh what you said it
it's a bit contradicts to the con
concept of httlc because you need only
one secrets to release as shall see
to trees balance from hdlc
maybe
because don't uh don't want to share
some wrong information and alex say he's
the
architect
of all this uh of always preach
maybe tibet asked him not to just
share the wrong information maybe i
missed something because i don't know
um 12.
you know i i think alexey novikov should
know
yeah but at the same time it's not clear
from the picture uh why you need to send
network information to
uh british multisig uh because the idea
is that that token should be
collected all right oh it's it's not
exchanged
so it's not exchange it's not exchange
present to users it is the
exchange between uh bridge
bridge liquidity provider and uh user
wanted i think that's that's the point
yeah
so so yes for bridge so uh bridge
operators they act as liquidity
providers for
actual transfers
radio
okay that makes sense
yep
okay thank you for your question thank
you for the answer and i i think you
know if uh more clarity is needed then
we'll have we'll have uh alex anovakov
answer that um
uh
normally we go to youtube at the end but
um there are two specific questions uh
the first is uh is there a is there a
demo
for
ever rangers
uh
as i said demo will be shared
very
very very soon
and then once we have them actually but
don't forget
what
sorry
we were you still speaking i apologize
okay no no no no no uh that will be
uh
yes
demo will be shared in
some days in few days one two three
uh very very soon
i mean the link for the demo because we
have deleted because we have the link
for them
but i don't finish cherry
okay and the second question is is is
the code open source be interesting to
see
yes it's open source and will be
will be
uh
will be show to everybody yes it's open
source
okay and
it can be seen now or or will in a
matter of days or
or weeks
is it
open now
yes just a few days really just few two
days it's open now by the way but
i mean we will uh
team will share the link in a few days i
mean the link to find it
if you're lucky you can try to find it
now because it's open source right now
but
some days some days sure sure yeah sure
okay
uh alexi thank you very much uh i don't
think we have any more questions so
let's move on to our next presenter um
that's gonna be uh kirill cyril i'm
gonna say karil because
okay
uh from poker ton which i hope
very soon will be rebranded into
something a little bit more ever scalish
um i think we we talked about that but
you know it's up to you guys uh anyway
um he's here to talk about several uh
tournament announcements uh including
the fire cube
series in poker so if you're a poker fan
like i am
uh this is for you so kirill
please go ahead
greetings everyone
i'll be brief
pokertown has prepared of series of
special tournaments
called fire cube series
which will be held on april at pokertown
the prize fund of all
tournament series is
500k cube tokens
cube yeah
in the end of the series we will send
all cube tokens to winners
to
enter tournaments you need to start
poker on board
and then
full-fledged application will be opened
and you need only to find a tournament
section and find
um
some fire cube
tournaments uh for example we have some
free rolls for example you know not
needs no need to
pay any buy-in you
but the price pool in this free rows
only one cube
if you want to win for example 25 cubes
you can enter
on 10th april firecube
and pay you need to pay 25 ever
um yes you need uh
talk ever tokens two and ten ever it
says
ah ten hours yeah yeah sorry 10 hours
yes uh buying 10 hours and you can win
25 hours uh for example
um
yes
soon we will
publish a full uh
scheduled of tournament series and you
can find this schedule on poker tone
telegram channels
if you have any questions you can ask on
uh pocket on chats
and uh
you
and we will answer
yes as we see cube token has a high
demand and low supply and many people
want to buy it on pre-sale
and we as poker ton give opportunity to
win tokens through playing poker uh i
think it's cool mechanic uh it's like uh
for its form
of play to earn mechanic play poker on
ever or for free and win
tokens
i think it's cool mechanic
[Music]
please join us and try to win some cube
if you
don't enter on
a pre-sale on everstart for example i
personally
have some small small allocation of
tokens
cube tokens
uh and little reminder about poker tone
one minute
uh
attracting new users to every scale
network is a part of our mission uh it's
our main mission
and we have been the first ever scale
partners from the start of every scale
network
launch we host first tournament that's
seven days after the everscale mainnet
launch
and also
we will continue promoting um
by adding cube or zoom token and other
partners project tokens as prizes in
pokertown tournaments
ron if you want we can promoting
tokens of
i forgot
i forgot naming
ever
ever ever no no not ever
no no cube um not cube i forgot um
sorry
yes
yes yes you can give you can give small
allocation to pocket on and we can
create tournament series uh
but after cube and after soon token guys
we can host tournament series and why
[Laughter]
also we can
do it together because i don't want to
mix
i want to
i think that great to focus
first cube series and other series only
one series per
day yeah
and we have posted a report about pocket
on performance on you can find an
acquainted with our report
in the forum
we have uh half million users in total
almost two hundred and
on chains wallet
um
yes
that's 230 000.
okay yes i forgot k
that's all i want to say
please join fire cube series if you have
any questions so you can ask in charts
and our admins will help you
thank you for your attention
and thank you kirill
that's wonderful very interesting
fantastic so everybody who wants to join
join do it no
personally ask you to go and do it
unless you hate poker and then learn how
to play and do it
thank you carol appreciate it
okay um yeah uh so let's move on to our
last segment um
hang on
i always come up with these silly
silly quotes
i look forward to them every week ron
i'm sure you do you stay up nights
wondering what ron's going to come up
with and it's so hilariously funny that
even i can't laugh at him
so as always
uh here comes our quick shot curly fry
that's you
aspiring musician word magician and
community statistician on an information
mission then
yes
that's your best one so far i like that
curly really i thought that was the
worst one all right but okay i might
change my uh twitter handle now bro
blushy blush all right
brilliant okay so bits this week i've
got loads to get through so uh
let's start with uh content
um we've had some content coming out in
the form of ever kits nikita did a
really cool interview
uh we've had an article about nfts on
ever how to make your own mnfts going
through grand bazaar and a few other
processes
uh there's been a really cool article
come out about grants and the scouting
grants program and uh also a couple more
on that note so again if you've not read
them if you've not shared them you know
if they're on medium you can go on you
just hold the button and do some claps
and it helps the visibility yeah really
really helps the words
okay so uh we've had some video content
apart from never mind the coins of
course
uh there's been a bunch of summaries of
the weekly meetings going out on the uh
well the channel you're watching now if
you're on youtube hi youtube
uh there's also a bunch of really
helpful videos going out on the surf
youtube channel as well
uh on the note of the cube token uh
that's been really interesting hasn't it
they indeed as you might have seen in on
kirill's screen there uh five times
their own hard cap in the pre-sale so
demand was huge there really
and i believe they also burnt all the
ever from the transaction fees
from that token sale so that's pretty
cool really isn't it a little bit of
burn
uh
still on the note of brocktus uh the
bridge
the octa-octus bridge is now even easier
to use they've kind of streamlined the
processes over there and they've also
had the fourth part of the bridge token
air drop so if if you hold bridge token
and you know you've been holding go go
collect that why not you know free money
uh
there was
not such good news a couple of issues uh
this week which should be noted about
impersonators in telegram so people
pretending to be you know members of the
everex team or the brocktos team sending
out just basically you know if someone
messages you out of the blue it's
probably not one of us guys the surf
team a lot of people yeah yeah exactly
and i mean basic advice if you're on
telegram you can always check the
message history if you go into the chat
and try and send us the first message
etc yeah you'll always be on the right
route there but no one's ever going to
ask you for your private details your
name your phone number nothing like that
you know but i don't want to know those
things about you
so stay vigilant basically
uh june network i think we've touched on
this but uh basically i believe
the 99 the majority of this should have
gone through by now all the tokens i
mean that i've was i believe my second
half of my tokens were pretty much
toward the bottom of the list and i've
received them so if you haven't yet and
yeah you're wondering how to do the
final steps or whatever send me a
message or yeah reach out to fabrice or
someone will help
there was amazing news uh see what i did
there with the amaze and everex
partnership i haven't really read into
the details but i know that it's pretty
cool stuff alex might be able to fill in
give us a word on that
uh in a minute or two
oh yeah so podcasting as well kwpc i
believe that's coming soon if me just
not still with us but uh he's got big
plans uh myself and anastasia are
actually kind of moving on to a bit of a
project so he's got new hosts over there
but it's all still very exciting stuff
and on the note of uh well me and
anastasia doing a little project uh
never mind the coins news we're
going to be doing our first episode
today i mentioned it a few weeks back
now that we've got some plans in the
works
uh but like i say obviously there's been
a few events and that kind of thing it's
been the breaks have been put on but
this will be coming soon tonight
hopefully
touchwood definitely definitely i've
even recorded a theme tune for it and
final one for me which
segways and ties back nicely to uh the t
zos bridge
um i'm
trying a little viewer giveaway
competition with the never mind the
coins uh show podcast whatever you want
to call it nowadays
so if you watch the show there's a
little viewer listener contest where you
can win a hundred ever brilliant
and my lovely other half uh also works
for a project running on the tesos
blockchain and she's thrown in a hundred
dog tokens which is a very exciting
project over there so soon you might be
able to bridge them across to your ever
stick them in your ever wallet hey
brilliant house that'll tie together i
like when that happens
and um yeah about belief that's my bits
for the week thank you very much
everyone
well thank you very much ben well you
always do it so quick i don't understand
how you just
right through it man awesome thank you
very much
okay um we do have a question from uh
youtube and it goes to me uh
also to meet you and chuck and a few
other people but uh i'll i'll
i'll deal with it so it's a long one but
let me condense it into one simple uh
statement uh somebody's asking about the
status on qan quick app ninja
saying you supported it meaning myself
a few other people did as well
and uh wondering what the kpi was
completed please say something about now
and then uh why no comments why no
nothing so first i'd like to say i did
leave a comment i left a very extensive
comment i didn't leave it in the qan
chat i replied in a chat
that is uh
called
[Music]
that is
directed directly at me and a chuck that
was started within the forum so i
replied where the comment came so if you
go and look there you'll find it if
you'd like i'm happy to replicate it on
the qan chat and the bottom line is this
it's it's quite simple
we follow a process so i supported it um
i think a lot of people supported it it
passed which is why it was supported
since then um there has been an
analytics report that's been uh
requested
per the original uh partnership proposal
and we're waiting for that
my understanding is
part of the reason that report wasn't
published
was because it might be
not necessarily
necessary because it might
put
somebody in
[Music]
under
a sense of impropriety
however i requested personally that it
be published and as i understand it will
be so i don't uh jump to conclusions
like um some people do uh judging based
on the fact that something happened a
year ago
it's important to also remind people
that uh the qan partnership was if
not the third maybe the fourth so we're
talking about somewhere in the jewish
august-ish time frame of 2021
when we were just you know still
unraveling how all of this is going to
work i
absolutely agree
that whatever the report says
i will support whatever that says
um but i don't work on the basis of
personal emotion were there some things
that happened with qan where tokens were
sold
uh without uh
results being provided yep i agree i
absolutely agree but i also think that
uh before you go to an emotional tirade
why don't you a read my comment which i
didn't leave in the qan chat like i said
which i'll happily copy and paste and
the second thing is let's wait for the
report and then we can throw stones okay
so i hope that answers that question
um and that
is pretty much it uh unless anybody else
has a question or a comment
i think we're done
anyone last call for alcohol
no
okay
everybody thank you so much for coming i
appreciate it i do it every week and i
love your support and um
everybody enjoys these uh
these uh
these uh calls so have a great rest of
your week have a wonderful weekend and
uh i haven't done this in a while how
about a because we have time three
two
one
goodbye
bye thank you bye
