00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,000
and decided that for the sake of
 

523
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,030
and decided that for the sake of
defining winners uh

524
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,040
defining winners uh
 

525
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,150
defining winners uh
we will uh not use

526
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
we will uh not use
 

527
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,389
we will uh not use
votes of those jurors who didn't vote

528
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
votes of those jurors who didn't vote
 

529
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,430
votes of those jurors who didn't vote
for all

530
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:23,440
for all
 

531
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,870
for all
works actually although there is a new

532
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880
works actually although there is a new
 

533
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,910
works actually although there is a new
polemics raised

534
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:27,920
polemics raised
 

535
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,590
polemics raised
afterwards and

536
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
afterwards and
 

537
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,829
afterwards and
some other members so they resisted this

538
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
some other members so they resisted this
 

539
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,870
some other members so they resisted this
position so

540
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:34,880
position so
 

541
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,230
position so
uh first of all we need to make the

542
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,240
uh first of all we need to make the
 

543
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,150
uh first of all we need to make the
calculation for both cases

544
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,160
calculation for both cases
 

545
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,910
calculation for both cases
and i already asked the contest stats

546
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:41,920
and i already asked the contest stats
 

547
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,189
and i already asked the contest stats
group to do this

548
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
group to do this
 

549
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,629
group to do this
and we will present the results

550
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
and we will present the results
 

551
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,269
and we will present the results
of this calculation both results so the

552
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:49,279
of this calculation both results so the
 

553
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,150
of this calculation both results so the
original one

554
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,160
original one
 

555
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,670
original one
uh according to us if uh all

556
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
uh according to us if uh all
 

557
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,230
uh according to us if uh all
jurors vote will be counted and the new

558
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
jurors vote will be counted and the new
 

559
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,949
jurors vote will be counted and the new
one

560
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:56,959
one
 

561
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,069
one
uh when some votes are put aside

562
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079
uh when some votes are put aside
 

563
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,350
uh when some votes are put aside
and then we will uh decide what to do

564
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
and then we will uh decide what to do
 

565
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,590
and then we will uh decide what to do
actually so it's it's a tricky point

566
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,600
actually so it's it's a tricky point
 

567
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,629
actually so it's it's a tricky point
actually because

568
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
actually because
 

569
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,269
actually because
there is some ambiguity in in the

570
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:09,279
there is some ambiguity in in the
 

571
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,310
there is some ambiguity in in the
contest terms

572
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
contest terms
 

573
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,470
contest terms
uh on how to tackle to those voices

574
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
uh on how to tackle to those voices
 

575
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,790
uh on how to tackle to those voices
uh for example which are not

576
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800

 

577
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,269

qualified enough so for example they

578
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:21,279
qualified enough so for example they
 

579
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,430
qualified enough so for example they
consist of two words only

580
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,440
consist of two words only
 

581
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,189
consist of two words only
and uh although the contest terms do not

582
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
and uh although the contest terms do not
 

583
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,430
and uh although the contest terms do not
uh prohibit uh to count such such votes

584
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
uh prohibit uh to count such such votes
 

585
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,710
uh prohibit uh to count such such votes
although the juror uh will not get the

586
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
although the juror uh will not get the
 

587
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,310
although the juror uh will not get the
the reward but uh still the the result

588
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
the reward but uh still the the result
 

589
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,990
the reward but uh still the the result
of his uh

590
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
of his uh
 

591
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,990
of his uh
votes may be counted uh

592
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,000
votes may be counted uh
 

593
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,350
votes may be counted uh
so i think that first of all we need to

594
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,360
so i think that first of all we need to
 

595
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,550
so i think that first of all we need to
calculate both scenarios and after that

596
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
calculate both scenarios and after that
 

597
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,269
calculate both scenarios and after that
so uh discuss once again

598
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
so uh discuss once again
 

599
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,470

really invest their time and analyze
each

658
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,360
each
 

659
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,470
each
each work uh very diligently

660
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,480
each work uh very diligently
 

661
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,750
each work uh very diligently
uh some others they just hop on

662
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:25,760
uh some others they just hop on
 

663
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,909
uh some others they just hop on
to the voting train in the very last

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640

 

667
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,470

throw some random random votes

668
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,480
throw some random random votes
 

669
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,590

and this is uh this is bad actually for
 

673
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,950
and this is uh this is bad actually for
for the

674
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960
for the
 

675
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,230

how to improve this is a good question

678
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
how to improve this is a good question
 

679
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,270
how to improve this is a good question
and

680
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,280
and
 

681
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,470
and
uh there is no direct answer to this so

682
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:52,480
uh there is no direct answer to this so
 

683
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,830
uh there is no direct answer to this so
this can be

684
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:53,840
this can be
 

685
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,430
this can be
elaborated only by the experiment uh

686
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
elaborated only by the experiment uh
 

687
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,830
elaborated only by the experiment uh
so we already tried for example in the

688
00:17:59,830 --> 00:17:59,840
so we already tried for example in the
 

689
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,350
so we already tried for example in the
device of governance to

690
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
device of governance to
 

691
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,750
device of governance to
increase number of jurors we try to

692
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:03,760
increase number of jurors we try to
 

693
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,029
increase number of jurors we try to
increase the reward of jurors

694
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
increase the reward of jurors

but in some cases it was not possible
 

783
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,549
but in some cases it was not possible
literally

784
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:04,559
literally
 

785
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,270

a hundred million of different factors

786

here is transparency

792
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,120
here is transparency
 

793
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,870
here is transparency
uh because uh from participant side

794
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
uh because uh from participant side
 

795
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,149
uh because uh from participant side

uh i cannot say that there was a weak
 

797
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,590
uh i cannot say that there was a weak
transparency because

798
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:21,600

974
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,080

 

975
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,669

i had to use other k and then

976
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:25,679
i had to use other k and then
 

977
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,789
i had to use other k and then
easy walls program that i'm usually used

978
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:28,799
easy walls program that i'm usually used
 

979
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,430
easy walls program that i'm usually used
for

980
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440

 

981
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,549

i just couldn't pass it and

982
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:34,559
i just couldn't pass it and
 

983
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,669
i just couldn't pass it and
that's all and it didn't work as well

984
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:37,679
that's all and it didn't work as well
 

985
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:38,310
that's all and it didn't work as well
because

986
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320
because
 

987
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,110
because
the key was changed and i had to do this

988
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,120
the key was changed and i had to do this
 

989
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,870
the key was changed and i had to do this
manually in the last minutes and just

990
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:42,880
manually in the last minutes and just
 

991
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,390
manually in the last minutes and just
because i technically

992
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:44,400
because i technically
 

993
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,830
because i technically
didn't time to put all my marks

994
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:47,840
didn't time to put all my marks
 

995
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,310
didn't time to put all my marks
on the system so it's like a technical

996
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,320
on the system so it's like a technical
 

997
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,590
on the system so it's like a technical
issue

1046
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,000
created the work i submitted it and now
 

1047
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,870
created the work i submitted it and now
you are just

1048
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:00,880
you are just
 

1049
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,390
you are just
ruin my work by uh

1050
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:04,400
ruin my work by uh
 

1051
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,430
ruin my work by uh
for what so i don't understand and there

1052
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:07,440
for what so i don't understand and there
 

1053
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,830
for what so i don't understand and there
is a silence for madison

1054
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:09,840
is a silence for madison
 

1055
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,070
is a silence for madison
this is uh one of the systemic problems

1056
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,080
this is uh one of the systemic problems
 

1057
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,549
this is uh one of the systemic problems
that need to be addressed and solved

1058
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:14,559
that need to be addressed and solved
 

1059
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,750
that need to be addressed and solved
actually so uh i don't have

1060
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:17,760
actually so uh i don't have
 

1061
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,990
actually so uh i don't have
the solution for this now and i think

1062
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,000
the solution for this now and i think
 

1063
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,909
the solution for this now and i think
that nobody thinks

1064
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:21,919
that nobody thinks
 

1065
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,390
that nobody thinks
but at least we can uh form some

1066
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,400
but at least we can uh form some
 

1067
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,190
but at least we can uh form some
hypothesis

1068
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:25,200
hypothesis
 

1069
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,510
hypothesis
and and try to test them in the coming

1070
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:27,520
and and try to test them in the coming
 

1071
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,710
and and try to test them in the coming
contests

1072
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:28,720
contests
 

1073
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,710
contests
uh so for example uh

1074
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:32,720
uh so for example uh
 

1075
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,669
uh so for example uh
the presence that the ama session for

1076
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:35,679
the presence that the ama session for
 

1077
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,029
the presence that the ama session for
jurors is obligatory

1078
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039
jurors is obligatory
 

1079
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,630
jurors is obligatory
yeah to get the reward uh can we

1080
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640
yeah to get the reward uh can we
 

1081
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,590
yeah to get the reward uh can we
test this why not yeah so in this case

1082
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:43,600
test this why not yeah so in this case
 

1083
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:43,990
test this why not yeah so in this case
uh

1084
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,000
uh
 

1085
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,390
uh
at least jurors will understand uh what

1086
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:46,400
at least jurors will understand uh what
 

1087
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,909
at least jurors will understand uh what
is going on and what the submissions are

1088
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:47,919
is going on and what the submissions are
 

1089
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:48,710
is going on and what the submissions are
about

1090
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
about
 

1091
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,950
about
uh on the other uh

1092
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:52,960
uh on the other uh
 

1093
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,430
uh on the other uh
is it possible for example to draw a

1094
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,440
is it possible for example to draw a
 

1095
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,269
is it possible for example to draw a
juror to change the vote

1096
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:57,279
juror to change the vote
 

1097
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,950
juror to change the vote
not now of course yeah because the

1098
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:58,960
not now of course yeah because the
 

1099
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,549
not now of course yeah because the
contract doesn't allow this

1100
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:00,559
contract doesn't allow this
 

1101
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,510
contract doesn't allow this
but uh sometimes when juror uh didn't

1102
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
but uh sometimes when juror uh didn't
 

1103
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,230
but uh sometimes when juror uh didn't
understand

1104
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:04,240
understand
 

1105
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,830
understand
and he hurried to cast the vote

1106
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:07,840
and he hurried to cast the vote
 

1107
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,470
and he hurried to cast the vote
and later on he just discovers that his

1108
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,480
and later on he just discovers that his
 

1109
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,350
and later on he just discovers that his
uh score

1110
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:11,360
uh score
 

1111
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,830
uh score
was wrong and he wants to change it but

1112
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:13,840
was wrong and he wants to change it but
 

1113
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,669
was wrong and he wants to change it but
he cannot

1114
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:15,679
he cannot
 

1115
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,190
he cannot
so uh this is also another another

1116
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,200
so uh this is also another another
 

1117
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,510
so uh this is also another another
thing that in my opinion should be

1118
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:21,520
thing that in my opinion should be
 

1119
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,630
thing that in my opinion should be
changed because

1120
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:22,640
changed because
 

1121
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,269
changed because
uh unless the voting period is over so

1122
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:25,279
uh unless the voting period is over so
 

1123
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,950
uh unless the voting period is over so
uh

1124
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:26,960
uh
 

1125
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,990
uh
it's not criminal to change your vote

1126
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,000
it's not criminal to change your vote
 

1127
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,350
it's not criminal to change your vote
actually maybe it's it's it's

1128
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:33,360
actually maybe it's it's it's
 

1129
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,549
actually maybe it's it's it's
uh not to post the votes uh uh

1130
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:36,559
uh not to post the votes uh uh
 

1131
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,669
uh not to post the votes uh uh
until the the very last moment uh

1132
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:39,679
until the the very last moment uh
 

1133
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,470
until the the very last moment uh
i mean i mean to analyze the votes in

1134
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:42,480
i mean i mean to analyze the votes in
 

1135
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,669
i mean i mean to analyze the votes in
the contract

1136
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:43,679
the contract
 

1137
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,310
the contract
uh but i don't know how to do this

1138
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:46,320
uh but i don't know how to do this
 

1139
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,750
uh but i don't know how to do this
actually yeah because

1140
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:47,760
actually yeah because
 

1141
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,710
actually yeah because
the voting contract is uh

1142
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:52,720

 

1143
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,909

it is developed uh by tom labs and

1144
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:55,919
it is developed uh by tom labs and
 

1145
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,389
it is developed uh by tom labs and
there are several versions and i

1146
00:27:58,389 --> 00:27:58,399
there are several versions and i
 

1147
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,190
there are several versions and i
personally don't

1148
00:27:59,190 --> 00:27:59,200
personally don't
 

1149
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,230
personally don't
know everything about the latest version

1150
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:02,240
know everything about the latest version
 

1151
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,630
know everything about the latest version
except that it exists but how it looks

1152
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:04,640
except that it exists but how it looks
 

1153
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,590
except that it exists but how it looks
like

1154
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:05,600
like
 

1155
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,990
like
nobody knows actually

1156
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,000

 

1157
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,240

yeah we need two technical

1158
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,250
yeah we need two technical
 

1159
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,029
yeah we need two technical

solutions so we should allow
jury members to change their walls

jury members to change their walls
 

1165
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,549

and we should implement something like

to hide walls until the end
 

1171
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,430
to hide walls until the end
and after the voting period finished we

1172
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:31,440
and after the voting period finished we
 

1173
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,149
and after the voting period finished we
could check their law

1174
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:34,159
could check their law
 

1175
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,029
could check their law
that hiding votes until the variant is a

1176
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:37,039
that hiding votes until the variant is a
 

1177
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,310
that hiding votes until the variant is a
solution actually

1178
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,320
solution actually
 

1179
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,149

1287
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,990
you have some professional jurors
specializing on this and that so that we

specializing on this and that so that we
 

1289
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,190
specializing on this and that so that we
are coming to

1290
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:55,200
are coming to
 

1291
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,389
are coming to
uh you will have different views uh on

1292
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:58,399
uh you will have different views uh on
 

1293
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,669
uh you will have different views uh on
the same contest

the same contest
 

1295
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,990
the same contest
and in this case you will get the more

1296
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,000
and in this case you will get the more
 

1297
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,990
and in this case you will get the more
weighted uh

1298
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,000
weighted uh
 

1299
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,789
weighted uh
score so because the solution may be

1300
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:06,799
score so because the solution may be
 

1301
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,990
score so because the solution may be
technically

00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,000
technically
 

1303
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,149
technically
extremely interesting but it's unusable

1565
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,790
okay okay yeah makes sense so just a
video with uh with like an overview of

1566
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:24,800
video with uh with like an overview of
 

1567
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,150
video with uh with like an overview of
the solution and

1568
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,160
the solution and
 

1569
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,390
the solution and
yeah yeah pretty much like we did last

1570
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:28,400
yeah yeah pretty much like we did last
 

1571
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,910
yeah yeah pretty much like we did last
time so uh

1572
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:29,920
time so uh
 

1573
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,069
time so uh
doing ama session for such a complex

1574
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:32,079
doing ama session for such a complex
 

1575
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,270
doing ama session for such a complex
solution in my opinion

1576
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:33,280
solution in my opinion
 

1577
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,870
solution in my opinion
is a bit of overkill in case

1578
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:36,880
is a bit of overkill in case
 

1579
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,990
is a bit of overkill in case

jurors uh maybe we will
 

1583
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,349
