hi everybody this is sergey
hello
okay let's wait a couple minutes
for everyone to join who is interested
and then we will start
all right um
so
uh hello everyone so welcome to the 61st
uh weekly defy governance call so we
have one topic for today
to discuss
so the long-awaited uh ever never
contest stage two
so today is presented by the prevented
team uh so guys uh if you're ready
please the floor is yours
okay so hi everybody my name is probably
most of you already know me
and
i am
one of the directors of problem damn
mostly
mostly while working on formal
verification but also where they are
developing some smart contracts and
today together with my colleague
who is a key developer of the never
project
we're going to
[Music]
describe you this project
and to answer your questions
unfortunately andrey who is also the key
member of this project uh he's not able
to join us today
you know these days are very difficult
for everybody
so but we'll try to
survive without him
uh okay so please let me share the
screen
yes
okay
i can do it
okay
do you see my stream
yes we do great yes
okay let's start with a few words
what is never
in general um is impossibility
it was called node
as a reverse
name for tone but after rebranding the
new name is never
never is a stable coil
with a price quite
with the
price ever close to
one american dollar
and unlike uh some other
solutions like a
well-known udt for example
it's not based on
any centralization it's not based on
any fiat liquidity etc it's
fully decentralized and the price is
granted by the system itself
then
[Music]
later we will describe the basic
principles and how it should be
organized
uh
about the form of the never coin
right now we plan to see it as a native
one
because
as you probably know if i'm not wrong
the scale system allows
to have up to 64 native coins maybe i'm
wrong
please correct me if
you haven't
but uh and
we're going to introduce never as one of
these
yeah maybe uh sorry sir maybe it's it's
worth also to mention because not
everyone knows what the currency
collection uh
is
uh actually the the peculiarity of the
protocol we are using is that it can has
uh many native uh coins that can be used
also for gas payment and surf is the
system currency so and currently we have
only one system currency which you know
as ever
and uh potentially as srj said you can
add a few a few more and never is
expected to be one of those
okay
and uh
in case if something goes wrong and if
bible benches will not be able to
introduce as a native coin in this case
uh the
backup plan
is to design it as a tip three uh
tip three coin
but it is definitely
a less preferred
approach
i would also say uh i would also uh
know that it's not
tip three but rather tip three point one
because we had the uh standards update
recently yeah i know
yeah okay it's worse to reflect this
sure maybe now it's type 3 yes but in
the future must be type 3.1
yes or no
yeah
should be
okay so let's let's move on to the next
slide
and let's say a few words about the key
players or the key actor actors of this
process they're called validators
uh the
the goal of validators is to set up the
basic range between never and ever
so so
these are supposed to work in the
foreign way
they uh suggest
some rapes
such as them in a disclosed
equilibrium so nobody can can can
see them before rewind
and upon the time of revealing
all their
suggestions are
revealed
and
uh so the
media rate is considered as a basic rate
for uh for for the never ever
uh
rate um i change rate
so so
those radiators who failed to provide
the race close to the median one
uh uh
warned um
from
consideration from
this round
and in case of repetitions
can be slashed
because
such a
such behavior is considered as
potentially suspicious
and
intemperate
to
provide the real
rate
validators are
expected to use so-called oracles
that are of chain agents
that takes
the current rates from the popular
exchanges
like for example
bitcoin exchange
and
uh um
um
and and
[Music]
these oracles are able to provide the
information to build data centers
use this uh this data to make their
decisions
it's not mandatory for the validators to
use a standard oracle they can they're
free to use anyone but it's strictly
encouraged
and
by using the uh the standard oracles all
the
good
uh owners validators are supposed to
have approximately the same
rate from never to ever
that
allows us to
set up a good and fair
exchange rate for
for for this pair
apparently while we
implemented
oracles and uh
and most of the other holidays will lead
us during the phase one of the contest
and uh
everybody could
can look at the
at our solutions for defined number five
contest number 24.
by the way i forgot
i want to say that
this solution is fully based on
certified contest number fourteen
uh
[Music]
on the article created by media
graciously and andre russian
so if you need any details any any deep
technical details you can look in
into that article
okay any questions so far
i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm saying something
and i'm muted
so actually
my first question here uh is
which
exchanges
so
oracle
can uh or validator of the system yeah
so can provide any data in fact uh about
the exchange rate of uh ever to us
dollar
uh so uh what happens uh if for example
someone takes uh as input data
uh some exchange that this uh provides
so this doesn't have enough liquidity
for example for forever and that's why
it's exchange rate fluctuates a lot and
also uh
on
on average so it provides the wrong date
so will this validate to be slashed uh
or what happens with him so how how's
the slashing mechanism works actually
actually uh yes
this is
for the current round
and in case of
repetitions it
can be slashed
yeah but it's slashing uh is hard
meaning that it
slashes all the stake of the validator
or
it rather slashes a
part of it
actually
if i
if
i'm
if i'm right
there for the final solution about it
is not made yet and it's for phase three
so three of our activity
and uh uh
counties are some discussions around it
so for example media is uh
has a very hard opinion and here he
needs uh he thinks that it will be a
very hard session
uh for example uh i think that it should
be
a much softer process
correct me if i'm wrong
uh as i know now it's uh
it's developed like a
streak
killing we
remove
the whole stake at the moment
but yeah it's
this
decision can be easily um
remain remade uh so
we
this decision is for phase three yeah we
should wait for meetings and
meet this decision
okay
guys any other questions on this part
okay uh so uh actually what uh
are you going to
continue the presentation so uh yeah
okay please please go on
okay so
let's move to the next part when once
the basic price is
found
it's considered as a base
as a base default price
for
upcoming never ever auctions
never evolution
mechanism for
even
reverification of terrain
provided by the validators
and
corrects it
according to the
desire of the participants who
who actually like to buy never or
sell levels
so these auctions are implemented as a
weekly auction weekly auction is a
sealed beat second price auction
the the minimal loads are pretty pretty
high
so uh
so
enters
any kind of strange
bits can be slashed
that does not encourage
participants to use as a fair price and
not not to play
with some uh
not to try to
to
artificially change the rate
um
well when they all when the auction
is complete the winners
get the required loads
and all the other participants
are able to uh are welcome to
make the direct
exchange
you you use the price
found by the auction plus some practice
and a significant fear
the exact
amount of fear
is being discussed and will be found and
will be found later basically i i think
it's a
degree parameter
any questions
no that's basically him
guys please
okay i think you can move
as i already mentioned
as a previous slide the minimum load is
pretty high
and
[Music]
very few participants can afford it
to
increase the ability of participants to
participate in these auctions
the auction
mechanism is uh
adjacent so it's basically something
like depool
but for
uh
auctions so the participants can uh
uh
to be able to buy a big lot
[Music]
how participants can select uh the best
uh the auction if participants do not
know the price
but
they have some strategy for example
then they can use the information from
the particular exchanges
then can
say use
more aggressive high higher prices or
more conservative lower prices
but i didn't get the question
that the auction is the joint
business mechanism yeah
okay so then
it means that uh somebody should select
the price which is offered by that beat
and i just had this should
uh
adhere to
to that price
to that offer
actually maybe i need some help from
vadim here
yeah i know i know the answer in a
current version of design
the ocean has its owner its
admin
and
its person or maybe even contract uh who
makes the decision
so participants only gives
gives a currency and the owner makes a
decision
i think it's
really
will be worse to have
a set of
information about hd auction in fact
explaining
who is it and
how the price is formed actually so the
price algorithm that
this validator is using and
on this basis people will be selecting
this was at the auction
but uh i agree with spiders without
knowing
anyone so i personally wouldn't put any
any penny in each of these directions
unless i know
how they behave
i i agree they definitely need to
explain their strategy beforehand
and somehow are you that
do you plan to provide some interface
for this
what do you mean do we
i guess no because
strategy is a strategy the ocean the
ocean's owner can do it anything
as
they want and
can advertise it in
anyhow
as they want but i guess
it can be implemented for example
as
some
owner contract with public
public code
but
i don't know how how exactly should it
work
so so owner is not the person owner is
uh is a contract
i personally based on my experience
would recommend you uh in any case you
will have the project page so somehow
yeah so and for people be able to deploy
the validators whatever
uh also
have uh the tool on your web page for
each validator to provide description at
least about them and
how they are calculating the price
because otherwise it's a black box so it
doesn't work like this
okay maybe we should work on uh
how to how to how to um
work uh
huh
how uh owners of the oceans can uh
determine their strategies maybe i don't
know it's the point to think
uh how how often auctions
go
is it like each block or every 10 blocks
or
how it works
uh i guess it's about uh every
every every few minutes or maybe every
hour because uh uh
price uh
pri pri oracle's uh price calculation is
not not so fast it takes
about 20 or 30 seconds
but then there will be huge slippage
because yes
you you yeah you provided some
of course when you go into the auction
uh you
you can look at the current price on the
market and those those oracles they
provide just indicative range for an
auction but still okay uh
it's it's a question to andre andre and
media uh it's their decision uh
we when we know we know uh about that
problem uh
it's uh this design is uh
uh is uh um
experimental
experimental here uh uh
it's it's it's the idea how how should
work they don't think it's it's a big
deal
i'm not economist i can't i can't uh
say anything
okay guys okay but you should uh
yeah you should understand what you're
doing
i mean
yeah my question is that
how quickly
auction will be executed
so you you made a bid and then in how
many
seconds blocks you'll get the
conversion
uh i guess though only uh the only
one only problem only issue that should
suspend the process is how fast
uh the auctions owners or maybe
personal participants
make their these bits so it can take i
don't know if
if you if you a few meals a few seconds
then
the time in
in which
they
have have guaranteed to
receive information about auction starts
make
decisions send it to blockchain
[Music]
uh i would recommend actually
having the set time
of
auctions so i mean that's a duration so
and everyone who made it uh he made it
if not if he's not because this case you
would be able at least to guarantee the
delivery of of the price uh
[Music]
timeline so means that for example you
have auction each 30 seconds
and
each second the price is defined
okay um
yeah sure it's it should be just uh uh
value in some conflict system conflict
uh but uh
uh yeah yeah it should value
okay
guys any other questions please
uh i have a question uh is the auction
is the participant of regular auction
because in original paper
it states that it's separate auctions
the auctions two
to two the auctions and two regular
options
uh in
our
current understanding of the
of the process the ocean is participant
of regular auction
it's just aggregate a
contract yeah it's it's it's a
kind of kind of uh fake participants uh
who
uh
who are a combination of a smaller
participant yeah it's liquidity pool
the question is that
actual from
usability point of view
and if auctions uh
quite
happen quite often then it is no way for
regular users to be able to
uh
participate because then they should
like
sit and wait before they send some uh
tokens to
the auctions and the other question is
that for example if you participated in
the election contract which didn't win
so then uh what happens then you don't
you don't
get exchange
as i know as i know uh in it's
it's not specified in the paper uh but
my
personal opinion is that the oceans
should be
re-runnable
and
like in
depots
any participant who can
[Applause]
put put it to a checkbox that
they
want to continue participating continue
their participation
and uh wait wait wait wait wait uh
wait for successful of successful
auction
it should
such behavior should be possible for uh
participants
to wait success to wait for success
okay
i have another question as well so um
two questions indeed um
the first one uh is about the uh reward
distribution so uh
so first first thing is uh how the
reward uh from where the report appears
yeah so and
then how it is distributed between
validators
it's
[Music]
it's not specified for now
uh
very very there is uh there is a few
possible strategies so it can be
uh
it can be a auctions fee it can be a
transfer fee uh it
can be
a part of emission
and
this decision decision is not made for
now
but can you at least please uh propose
those scenarios because i asked this
question last time so it's the first
stage so
and uh
it was too early maybe but now when
you're approaching the
uh implementation station the auctions
should if they ser
function as depooled so they also should
include the functionality
for
distributing rewards
and in this case so
it really
may be affected by how the economic
model is implemented
so i would recommend
at least defining a few ways on how the
economics can function
and the second
question is when there is a slashing
appears on some validator so where does
his stake goes
so
there is a distribution between all
other players and on what basis
or it's just
returned and his address is banned
or some some other scenario
um
it's not specified for now it can be in
in in any scenario and
as i understand it's
this solution is uh integration of
solution between different parts so it
should be on the final uh third
stage of the project
first to more about writing
the systems
oracle
validators
and auction dia auction
third is about to combine all the stuff
together
okay
well i think media joined us very cool
media maybe you have the answer to my
question about the economic model for
the system
which i didn't know which i didn't hear
the main question is uh uh what is the
motivation for uh validators uh to
participate in the system so where money
come from
and how is he distributed
well it distributes according to the
stakes
and in the white paper
there is a it's described the mechanism
which i don't remember now but there are
some commissions that uh taken from
auctions
and these commissions are
kind of they're it's described
in the white paper what what how the uh
like what what sort of commissions
um
is distributed between
[Music]
okay because uh i remember that we
discussed it some time ago so uh whether
or not this system so will be it will
have the fees for people who are willing
to um
uh
yeah so actually sell a lot or buy a lot
of uh neighbors uh
like 99 sure i mean i may remember that
that that's part of the white paper
okay
and uh are there any uh plans to uh use
the collateral that
is back in the never uh
exchange rate
uh
in some i don't know in landing
protocols or whatever so just to make
money no this is a stabilization uh
collateral so
it should be used to stabilize the the
system
because that exactly provides like an
insurance that provides
the guarantees that um
that you it's like a central bank uh
you know preserve
it ensures that there is no run on the
bank
like uh because people know that there
is always
a guarantee
that whatever happens
um
like
the the
the everest will be exchanged numbers
will be always essential with the within
the current price
um that is currently projected by
by
the oracles
okay so the answer is no
yeah the answer is no and and right but
again um
because if it would be over
collateralized then then you know what
will happen
yeah obviously it's like the collateral
which is over collateralized
means that
or i would say under collateralize in
this respect and that means no
collateral
yeah so if you use it in the lending
protocols then then then you're kind of
basically just reducing the
characterization
okay okay very good so um one uh maybe
last question from my side so uh whether
or not the system is going to have a
dial so uh to configure all the
parameters of this uh
never stabilization system
well we know when i thought that it's
need to have a dow because like these
validators that are are actually valid
they call oracles that validating it
and then the main governance now i think
should should govern the system because
it's a system it's a system protocol
and that's always was kind of like the
idea was to create a system level
protocol okay and and what is what it
what is important to mention is and i
thought by the way that oracles are
already uh implemented now
yeah they were implemented
so i would suggest additional kind of
small contest to add
or maybe it's already there i didn't
really see the implementation sorry um
it is very important to add actually uh
to the oracle data possibility to uh
suggest arbitrary data not only the like
dollar for example curve
uh price
so and that is important because if we
already have a protocol
that
kind of ensures the data is correct
meaning that the oracle data is correct
and we should use it to
uh to kind of provide all sorts of data
different other data
for example if someone wants to start a
synthetic asset of a projection apple
stock price within the system
then apart from the auction part so the
auction part is only forever and ever
but the oracles can
actually take and make more money by
that
by by also by also providing for the
same mechanism providing not the dollar
price data but
you know i will stock price data or you
know tesla stock right there price date
or whatever what not
then
and i i really want to use it in flex
because then any
any decks
can then create very easily create a
synthetic asset
based on this and
pay
back
under certain conditions like paid back
to the validators for providing this
this this data and that will create kind
of universal oracle more or less within
the system on the system level
um which i think is a very beneficial
idea and
i think that will create a lot of boost
for
kind of
as well basically it will position
um the access on every scale being able
to
provide same like kind of same
[Music]
services any centralized exchange uh
even not the crypto only one but for
example we can really go and and kind of
i don't know
compete with ftx
okay and it's easily done because again
the the protocol is already there
there's just an additional layer that
need to be
written to
kind of absorb that data and pay for it
which is which yeah i will write
actually i'm thinking about that already
for a few weeks now
because i really want to make it and
flex make all sorts of data available on
flex it is very important that it will
be decentralized
because then the regulator
as you may know regulator already acted
upon
a decentralized protocol so like less
centralized protocols which tried to do
the same thing as you know there were
several protocols who got subpoenaed by
scc because they
they started trading regular assets on
the blockchain
so therefore it is very important that
the provision of the service
uh and
it will be decentralized and then the
service
that it's um based upon this data like
the provision of the data is centralized
and the the service of the data is
separated from the provision of the data
the service that you built on top of
that so the asset itself like the this
synthetic part of it
in the decks is completely decoupled
from the data provided by the oracles
and has completely different like uh
governance
and both also decentralized right and
then and then it's also decentralized i
mean it's only dex then in this case
like what do you do
okay so someone is providing some data
someone else is smart has a smart
contract
that
you know make it trading on the on the
data possible and what do what you're
gonna do i mean
it's impossible to
to prevent this right so
um so i think this is very important and
i think that i will propose some
extension
later on of course when once this is
finished to to allow such thing as an
extension to the oracle's data
and that will provide i think additional
nice fit nice
kind of uh possibilities still your
question of the monetization it will
provide additional monetization for the
validators to
provide this data
very good
okay guys
any questions
please no uh okay let's move on
here
actually basically i'm almost done just
uh the last slides are mostly about the
current situation we already discussed
it so phase one is currently uh has been
completed
so
it's a
partial implementation of nervous
validate and uh and oracle's mechanism
so for phase 2 we propose oxygen
direction
and
phase 3 the last
the rest of the project
so also looks like
currently we need to
explicitly uh
address some issues that arise and your
durian today
for example about um
[Music]
about the strategy of the dear joey
auctions and
some other
and then we'll
represent this document for your bro
okay very good so uh concerning the
contest itself so uh
i uh
runs through the contest so and made
some fixes in the wording
uh so because most of the things that
you put there is already present in the
procedural remarks and we are
sticking to them so when we are running
the content on this in the device of
governance
uh so uh and a couple of things that i'm
missing uh hot criteria and the real
deliverables so please add those uh to
make the
uh transparent uh
understanding to jurors and to
participants so how this contest should
be judged uh you can uh take as an
example the ssi stage three uh contest
so i will send you the link
uh so please add those parts and we can
uh hopefully launch the contest today
for coin design i mean it should be i
think um the from the currency
collection right i don't know if that's
how it's yeah it's status there so it's
stated as a main case but also as a
backup plan for
to support the tip 3.1 token
um uh well i would just stick to the
currency collection i think this is like
an important systemic uh stablecoin no
need to do the t3 variation sergey then
in this case please remove the tip three
uh
token implementation okay
yeah no need for that
good
it's redundant just additional effort
all right uh so thank you guys from
prevent the team thank you sergey
so it was a nice presentation and a good
discussion in my opinion so uh so
when you are done with the boarding uh
things with the contest and just ping me
and i will launch the contest
in the governance interface
uh so actually this was the only topic
for today and
not so many news yet
but hopefully so we will start
collecting more more and more news
uh especially uh i know that guys from
uh the
uh defy lines are now just uh almost
finished building the website for the
everscale
and
more and more information is appearing
there
and also uh
they will be
merging the
the fire lines website into the
everscale website to make the homogenic
place where one can find
any information about the everscale
so
if you have any other topics we have a
few minutes left
for today so please raise your hand
three two one no no topics okay guys so
thank you for attending today and i will
publish the recording once it's
converted so and
see you next time next week hopefully
okay bye thank you
thanks baby
