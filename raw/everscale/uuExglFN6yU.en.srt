maybe because
 

585
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,030
maybe because
after cliff you would

586
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,040
after cliff you would
 

587
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,150
after cliff you would
the tokens would become gradually um

588
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,160

 

589
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,069

question is about
killer whale tokens

610
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:53,920
killer whale tokens
 

611
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,949
killer whale tokens
would it be a cross course of kilowatt

612
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
would it be a cross course of kilowatt
 

613
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,710
would it be a cross course of kilowatt
tokens and surf tokens

614
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:00,720

619
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,590

exchanges will support both tokens and

620
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
exchanges will support both tokens and
 

621

or
 

633
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,670
or
to integrate with flex

634
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,680

 

635
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,749

we are not going to

636
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:35,759
we are not going to
 

637
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,189

like text services will be available in
swerve but we are not going to create

644
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:43,680
swerve but we are not going to create
 

645
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,949
swerve but we are not going to create
own exchange because we have like we

646
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:46,959
own exchange because we have like we
 

647
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,430
own exchange because we have like we
have flex we have other maybe we'll find

654
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
i mean the main exchange flex will be
 

655
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,870
i mean the main exchange flex will be
integrated to the source app

656
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:02,880

 

657
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,189

yeah i think that flex is our strategic

658
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:05,199
yeah i think that flex is our strategic
 

659
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,870
yeah i think that flex is our strategic
partners so

660
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
partners so
 

661
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,710
partners so
a server would be a mobile terminal for

662
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720
a server would be a mobile terminal for
 

663
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,549
a server would be a mobile terminal for
this exchange

664
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
this exchange
 

665
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,829
this exchange
and uh you can find it in our road map

666
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:15,839
and uh you can find it in our road map
 

667
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,029
and uh you can find it in our road map
so yeah

668
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:17,039
so yeah
 

669
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,350
so yeah
flex not our own version of exchange

670
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:21,360
flex not our own version of exchange
 

671
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,230
flex not our own version of exchange
um

672
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,240
um
 

673
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,510
um
then

674
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
then
 

675
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,740
then
the next question

676
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:26,750

or why
 

681
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,830
or why
so little tokens is left for liquidity

682
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
so little tokens is left for liquidity
 

683
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,789
so little tokens is left for liquidity
pool

684
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:34,799
pool
 

685
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,430
pool
andrew could you help this question

686
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
andrew could you help this question
 

687
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,390
andrew could you help this question
yeah i'll see i'll show the distribution

688
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:40,400
yeah i'll see i'll show the distribution
 

689
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:47,590
yeah i'll see i'll show the distribution
at first um

690
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600

 

691
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,710

it's um

692
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:52,720

 

693
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,909

so because it's utility tokens and

694
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:55,919
so because it's utility tokens and
 

695
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,549
so because it's utility tokens and
because um

696
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559
because um
 

697
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,630
because um
so we are not

698
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
so we are not
 

699
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,789
so we are not
we are not going to

700
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
we are not going to
 

701
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,750
we are not going to
um

702
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:03,760
um
 

703
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,990
um
make it to create a bubble

704
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
make it to create a bubble
 

705
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,950
make it to create a bubble
so

uh i think we can maybe
 

777
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,830
uh i think we can maybe
talk about an example of

778
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840
talk about an example of
 

779
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,390
talk about an example of
using a surf token inside survey

780
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:42,400
using a surf token inside survey
 

781
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,830
using a surf token inside survey
for example

782
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:43,840
for example
 

783
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,190
for example
we have

784
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
we have
 

785
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,510
we have
currently we have a partnership with the

786
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:47,520
currently we have a partnership with the
 

787
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,549

789
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,590
gift cards pro service provider
and

790
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:51,600
and
 

791
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,789
and
we can

792
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
we can
 

793
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,950
we can
the first i think the first case for

794
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
the first i think the first case for
 

795
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,110
the first i think the first case for
using surf token would be

796
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
using surf token would be
 

797
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,270
using surf token would be
integration with them so in surf you

798
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
integration with them so in surf you
 

799
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,789
integration with them so in surf you
would be able to

800
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:00,799
would be able to
 

801
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,190
would be able to
buy some gift cards

802
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,200
buy some gift cards
 

803
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,950
buy some gift cards
um from

804
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:04,960
um from
 

805
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,840
um from
for different

806
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,850

e-commerce sites
 

815
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,430
e-commerce sites
and then you would have some cashback

816
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,440
and then you would have some cashback
 

817
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,350
and then you would have some cashback
and surf tokens

818
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360

 

819
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,029

locked for this

820
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:21,039
locked for this
 

821
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,230
locked for this
purpose

822
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
purpose
 

823
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,110
purpose
so

824
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,120
so
 

825
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,230
so
um for service providers the use would

826
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,240
um for service providers the use would
 

827
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,430
um for service providers the use would
be to

828
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:27,440
be to
 

829
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,110
be to
use our audience and to use our

830
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,120
use our audience and to use our
 

831
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,390
use our audience and to use our
interface to make people access

832
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:34,400
interface to make people access
 

833
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,990
interface to make people access
their services in a native way

834
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,000
their services in a native way
 

835
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,830
their services in a native way
so i think it would be

836
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:39,840
so i think it would be
 

837
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,470
so i think it would be
a win-win situation for both sides for

838
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
a win-win situation for both sides for
 

839
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,430
a win-win situation for both sides for
users and for service providers

840
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,440
users and for service providers
 

841
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,350
users and for service providers
just as an example

842
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,360
just as an example
 

843
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,110
just as an example
of usage

844
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,120

 

845
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,350

then

846
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,360
then
 

847
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,350
then
next yeah we have many many ideas how to

848
00:20:59,350 --> 00:20:59,360
next yeah we have many many ideas how to
 

849
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,310
next yeah we have many many ideas how to
how to use these tokens like during for

850
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,320
how to use these tokens like during for
 

851
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,310
how to use these tokens like during for
stakings for

852
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
stakings for
 

853
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,510
stakings for
um

854
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:05,520
um
 

855
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,070
um
for purchases for top up the balances

856
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,080
for purchases for top up the balances
 

857
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,549
for purchases for top up the balances
and so on so uh so they will be

858
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:10,559
and so on so uh so they will be
 

859
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,110
and so on so uh so they will be
integrated i'll say in each products

860
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,120
integrated i'll say in each products
 

861
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,750
integrated i'll say in each products
that will be available in surf

862
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:15,760
that will be available in surf
 

863
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,230
that will be available in surf
yeah for example talking about staking

864
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
yeah for example talking about staking
 

865
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,590
yeah for example talking about staking
we can add additional validators to

866
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:21,600
we can add additional validators to
 

867
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,950
we can add additional validators to
the stake button inside surf

868
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960
the stake button inside surf
 

869
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,029
the stake button inside surf
and

870
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:27,039
and
 

871
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,669
and
that would help them to have more tokens

872
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:29,679
that would help them to have more tokens
 

873
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,110
that would help them to have more tokens
in their stakes in their depots or for

874
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,120
in their stakes in their depots or for
 

875
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,470
in their stakes in their depots or for
users uh it can be um

876
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480

 

877
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,149

increasing their

878
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:40,159
increasing their
 

879
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,590
increasing their
revenue their reward is taking

880
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:43,600
revenue their reward is taking
 

881
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,190
revenue their reward is taking
if

882
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,200
if
 

883
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,750
if
they have some surf tokens

884
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:47,760
they have some surf tokens
 

885
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,549
they have some surf tokens
so

886
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
so
 

887
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,470
so
i think

888
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
i think
 

889
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,070
i think
also it could be

890
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,080
also it could be
 

891
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,430
also it could be
a

892
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,440
a
 

893
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,630
a
multi-leveled

894
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:56,640

 

895
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,190

program inside the server when on

896
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,200
program inside the server when on
 

897
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,549
program inside the server when on
different levels you have different

898
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:00,559
different levels you have different
 

899
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,950
different levels you have different
possibilities it could be for example

900
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:02,960
possibilities it could be for example
 

901
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,950
possibilities it could be for example
calls insights are

902
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:04,960
calls insights are
 

903
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,909
calls insights are
available for

904
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:07,919

 

905
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,750

so um
this is one of the

1148
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:27,919
this is one of the
 

1149
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,110
this is one of the
reason

1150
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,120
reason
 

1151
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,430
reason
why we also

1152
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:31,440

also
 

1323
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,310
also
we of course we can use only error for

1324
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:14,320
we of course we can use only error for
 

1325
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,070
we of course we can use only error for
all these features

all these features
 

1327
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,149
all these features

1355
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,070
it's also one of the promotion when you
see the sort of token so you can

1356
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,080
see the sort of token so you can
 

1357
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,070
see the sort of token so you can
understand uh

1358
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,080
understand uh

features that you used in sword because
 

1367
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,350
features that you used in sword because
you will get uh these tokens for

1368
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:07,360
you will get uh these tokens for
 

1369
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,669
you will get uh these tokens for
for for staking for instance for cards

1370

1377
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,389

it's extra talking to every scale

1378
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:18,399
it's extra talking to every scale
 

1379
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,669
it's extra talking to every scale
it's it's not going to

1380
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:21,679
it's it's not going to
 

1381
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,310
it's it's not going to
to change the functions of error it's

1382
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,320
to change the functions of error it's
 

1383
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,389
to change the functions of error it's
impossible due to the

1384
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:26,399
impossible due to the
 

1385
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,470
impossible due to the
algorithm specific

1386
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:28,480
algorithm specific
 

1387
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,789
algorithm specific
so i hope yeah

1388
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:30,799
so i hope yeah

self-talking is not only utility token
 

1493
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,230
self-talking is not only utility token
but it's only a part of this idea

1494
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:32,240
but it's only a part of this idea
 

1495
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,510

00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,160
putting together these two areas
 

1499
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,470

and
 

1503
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,470
and
making it very smooth

1504
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:44,480
making it very smooth
 

1505
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,510
making it very smooth
and comfortable for both sides to

1506
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:47,520
and comfortable for both sides to
 

1507
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,710
and comfortable for both sides to
work with it to communicate to interact

1508
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:50,720
work with it to communicate to interact
 

1509
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,710
work with it to communicate to interact
to solve their problems

1510
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:52,720
to solve their problems
 

1511
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,910
to solve their problems
and in this way self-talking is a part

1512
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:55,920
and in this way self-talking is a part
 

1513
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,589
and in this way self-talking is a part
of the error scale it's another

1514
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:57,599
of the error scale it's another
 

1515
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,390
of the error scale it's another
structure but it has its id and its idea

1516
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:00,400
structure but it has its id and its idea
 

1517
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,069
structure but it has its id and its idea
of is the same as in the surf

1518
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:04,079
of is the same as in the surf
 

1519
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:04,870
of is the same as in the surf
its

1520
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:04,880
its
 

1521
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,310
its
idea of making this bridge

1522
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:08,320
idea of making this bridge
 

1523
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:15,510
idea of making this bridge
and making it comfortable to use

1524
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:15,520

 

1525
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,670

okay how have we answered alex

1526
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:19,680

 

1527
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,870

to your question

1528
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:20,880
to your question
 

1529
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,829
to your question
yeah

1530
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:21,839
yeah
 

1531
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,190
yeah
just

1532
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:23,200
just
 

1533
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,910
just
still it means that it's some kind of

1534
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:27,920

 

1535
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,790

i don't see actually real benefits

1536
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:30,800
i don't see actually real benefits
 

1537
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,990
i don't see actually real benefits
for the community having another token

1538
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,000
for the community having another token
 

1539
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,829
for the community having another token
if it is not governance token of course

1540
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:35,839
if it is not governance token of course
 

1541
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:36,870
if it is not governance token of course
but

1542
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:36,880
but
 

1543
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,390
but
as you said it will not be governance

1544
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:40,400
as you said it will not be governance
 

1545
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,150
as you said it will not be governance
so

1546
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,160

see any reason
for this

1554
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:51,920

1562
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:05,440
maybe let's go to this
 

1563
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,829
maybe let's go to this
next question

1564
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:07,839

any decentralized platform
 

1755
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,550
any decentralized platform
so now uh there is no smart contract as

1756
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:16,560
so now uh there is no smart contract as
 

1757
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,670
so now uh there is no smart contract as
i understand

1758
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:17,680
i understand
 

1759
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,190
i understand
am i right nikita

1760
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:19,200
am i right nikita
 

1761
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,230
am i right nikita
yeah you're right we continue to develop

1762
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,240
yeah you're right we continue to develop
 

1763
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,550
yeah you're right we continue to develop
the standard itself to free

1764
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:24,560
the standard itself to free
 

1765
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,069
the standard itself to free
so

1766
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:26,079
so
 

1767
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,790
so
when we will complete some

1768
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:28,800
when we will complete some
 

1769
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,270
when we will complete some
issues we

1770
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:31,280
issues we
 

1771
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,190
issues we
will start to implement it

1772
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:35,200
will start to implement it
 

1773
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,870
will start to implement it
so it will be tip 3 or tip 3.1

1774
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:40,880

 

1775
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,550

there are differences between this
 

1779
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,550
there are differences between this
standard as i know tip 3 is

of
the series of standards and tip 3.1 is

1786

the series of standards and tip 3.1 is
 

1787
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,790
the series of standards and tip 3.1 is
describes very basic

tip-free standard as i understand

1796
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:14,880

 

1797

but they support different methods
actually to get information about token

1800
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:19,920
actually to get information about token
 

1801
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,069
actually to get information about token
for example

1802
00:42:22,069 --> 00:42:22,079
for example
 

1803
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,910
for example
we still needed to be

1804
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:23,920
we still needed to be
 

1805
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,829
we still needed to be
changed a bit about

1806
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:25,839
changed a bit about
 

1807
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,589
changed a bit about
previous old format of tp but now is a

1808
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:29,599
previous old format of tp but now is a
 

1809
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,230
previous old format of tp but now is a
wrapper with the

1810
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:32,240
wrapper with the
 

1811
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,190
wrapper with the
old all the tips

1812
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,200
old all the tips
 

1813
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,990
old all the tips
of every scale and

1814
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,000
of every scale and
 

1815
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,030
of every scale and
one of the tips to free and inside the

1816
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:41,040
one of the tips to free and inside the
 

1817
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,950
one of the tips to free and inside the
standard

1818
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:42,960
standard
 

1819
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,710
standard
now uh there is three point one and

1820
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:46,720
now uh there is three point one and
 

1821
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,670
now uh there is three point one and
there will be some other

1822
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:49,680
there will be some other
 

1823
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,470
there will be some other
sub

1824
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:50,480
sub
 

1825
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,710
sub
sub sub interfaces

1826
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:52,720
sub sub interfaces
 

1827
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,109
sub sub interfaces
substandards to three point two and so

1828
00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:55,119
substandards to three point two and so
 

1829
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,349
substandards to three point two and so
on and uh

1830
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:57,359
on and uh
 

1831
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,990
on and uh
i think i can say yes for your

1832
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,000
i think i can say yes for your
 

1833
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,550
i think i can say yes for your
question because it's t 3.1 compatible

1834
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:04,560
question because it's t 3.1 compatible
 

1835
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,750
question because it's t 3.1 compatible
i think it would be even even another

1836
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:07,760
i think it would be even even another
 

1837
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,630
i think it would be even even another
some other format of tip three because

1838
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:10,640
some other format of tip three because
 

1839
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,550
some other format of tip three because
we needed to be

1840
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:12,560
we needed to be
 

1841
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,630
we needed to be
to work with flex and

1842
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:14,640
to work with flex and
 

1843
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,270
to work with flex and
flat cube all both of them

1844
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:17,280
flat cube all both of them
 

1845
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,829
flat cube all both of them
so i think that

1846
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:19,839
so i think that
 

1847
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,550
so i think that
you would be able to see the contract

1848
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:22,560
you would be able to see the contract
 

1849
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,950
you would be able to see the contract
root address and so on before the

1850
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:24,960
root address and so on before the
 

1851
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,510
root address and so on before the
meeting so end of april i think it's

1852
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:27,520
meeting so end of april i think it's
 

1853
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,030
meeting so end of april i think it's
there

1854
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,040
there
 

1855
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:29,750
there
as

1856
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:29,760
as
 

1857
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,750
as
broxas did

1858
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:31,760
broxas did
 

1859
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,750
broxas did
after upgrade

1860
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:33,760
after upgrade
 

1861
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,430
after upgrade
so

1862
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:35,440
so
 

1863
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:41,109
so
we will support this standard too

1864
00:43:41,109 --> 00:43:41,119

 

1865
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,109

okay

1866
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:43,119
okay
 

1867
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,150
okay
i hope we answered yeah

1868
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:46,160
i hope we answered yeah
 

1869
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,870
i hope we answered yeah
and next question is about our roadmap

1870
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:48,880
and next question is about our roadmap
 

1871
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,190
and next question is about our roadmap
on your roadmap quarter four then

1872
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:51,200
on your roadmap quarter four then
 

1873
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,430
on your roadmap quarter four then
support will take

1874
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:53,440
support will take
 

1875
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,710
support will take
dotsof or dot error

1876
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:58,720

 

1877
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,470

i think

1878
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:00,480
i think
 

1879
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,150
i think
both

1880
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:02,160
both
 

1881
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,910
both
of them

1882
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:03,920
of them
 

1883
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,829
of them
because it's important for the network

1884
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:05,839
because it's important for the network
 

1885
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,190
because it's important for the network
on the whole

1886
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:07,200
on the whole
 

1887
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,829
on the whole
but for

1888
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:09,839
but for
 

1889
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,510
but for
surf tokens

1890
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:11,520
surf tokens
 

1891
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,230
surf tokens
holders there would be some additional

1892
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:14,240
holders there would be some additional
 

1893
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:20,790
holders there would be some additional
benefits i think this is answer

1894
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:20,800

 

1895
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,790

and i

1896
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:22,800
and i
 

1897
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,309
and i
i don't see any more questions

1898
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:26,319
i don't see any more questions
 

1899
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:27,270
i don't see any more questions
so

1900
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:27,280
so
 

1901
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,230
so
maybe

1902
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:28,240
maybe
 

1903
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,030
maybe
if

1904
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:29,040
if
 

1905
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,069
if
we have

1906
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:30,079
