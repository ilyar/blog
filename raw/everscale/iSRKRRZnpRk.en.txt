so
now
further ado so
let's welcome the cap crew team
who will pitch the project
guys are you here
we don't hear you
you are unmuted
uh
now it's good now it's good
and and now and now
no it's okay
oh great uh welcome everybody it was
very exciting days and i'm ready to
start my presentation
i will try to briefly talk about the
project and more about our bridge and
show a little demo
so
let's start i hope you see my screen yes
uh
can can you see my screen yes
yes yes we can yes yes
so uh exudi
is an nft based blockchain project
where a traditional race board game
meets hairs of magic mechanics powered
by the blockchain and nft technology
and we really try to create a bridge
from real world to blockchain world
and
between all
and between different blockchains in
this world too
that's why our track is cross chain
excellence
yeah by the way
this sentence was created before
uh
before this hackathon because when we
planned
uh have plans about creating this
project
we thought about the bridge and between
real and blockchain and between
blockchains too that's why one of our
mission is to create the bridge between
traditional board games and the emerging
world of nft games those boarding
generations together
because i i think most of you play
different board games with your family
i like a system contains some very
important topics like nft browser game
physical copy it's not less important
because it's one of interesting thing in
our project
nintendo switch game
and what is more important cross chain
breach and dao
so i will show later a nft browser game
so it's very easy the main aim of this
game is to beat your opponent and to be
the to be the first to reach the finish
line by overcoming obstacles and it
fails that come your way as well
completing missions
physical copy
for holders of premium nfc nfcs we will
produce the physical versions of our
birds
boards i will talk about this later and
yes we have some developers who develop
some
indie games for nintendo switch and by
the way i'm
a player
i'm a good player too i like this
console and we decided that we would
integrate our game on this platform too
and by the way it can be the real one of
the first
games in blockchain
and
console i will start with the uh yeah
uh
and then the next part and one of the
most important part is cross chain
breach that's what uh about we will talk
today more deeply
so our users will also be able to
transfer the token in their valid from
one blockchain to another by using the
oculus bridge process technology
and why do we need why do they need this
uh as i have talked before
uh users can play
and they will be able to play for money
that's why there will be a special type
of rooms with entry fees paid by players
which will form a price pool which
participant will be fighting for
and
the most important and interesting thing
that there will be two types of these
rooms
the first type is cross chain rooms and
the next time is single blockchain rooms
what it means
participants pay entry fee in any tokens
that they like
supported by a big study
so its price pool consists of different
tokens for example imagine it can be
like a battle between blockchains for
example you have a friends from i don't
know avalanche or near and uh you are
from our scale so you pay
your fee in errors then somebody paid in
fx or
other tokens and then
who win of the game will get the price
in his tokens that's why it uh
that's why we need to use this invisible
bridge technology
to easily uh exchange token with some
fees and
give it to the users
the next and very important part while
we need bridge 2 and by the way while we
use framework for a process it's there
so the dao will be implemented to make
strategic decisions such as centering
into partnership holding tournaments and
so on
and every epic study holder will be able
to wait with their tokens that's why
we'll integrate this
and we will have some different roles
like investors partners and what is more
important uh
i will tell about this a little bit
later sorry for fast that one of the
main industry problems in nft that it
has a very weak connection with the real
nfg um
with the with the most traditional games
let's return back that's why
uh one of the most important part of
this tao will be game manufacturers and
terminal associations
uh and by the way families yes because i
think it can be very interesting to
create you know like a clan in this dao
and you will play and so on
uh
that's why
we will use uh framework and some part
of contracts like download contract
proposal contract and we will continue
we start with integration uh the bridge
which i will show you now and the next
stage of our integration will be
integration of tao and uh invisible
bridge in our games which i will show
you a little bit later
uh piece of the tokens will be used to
level up guild beiges unlock deeper
access it's just some list of ideas like
cross guild tournaments i think it can
be very interesting thou voting for nft
creation
for in-house events and rewards it's the
first list of what we will have but it
can be more
um i will briefly talk about the game
economy and other parts of our project
and go to the demo
yeah the main uh part of
pcd4 was their free-to-play model allows
players to get with the accounted with
the game with zero friction
but they can have extra boards extra
boards tournament pairs skins and other
and other things and the most
interesting is pixie box it's like a
random box of different energies by the
way for different kind of different
blockchains that's why we need to use
the bridge too
uh i will go briefly through game
industry problems uh
i have already talked about weak
connection with traditional gamers
and we will
make solution for this because our main
mission to connect um
real world and blockchain world also
there are not a lot of games for
consoles and we will
solve this problem too and by the way we
have some
research and many k board game
manufacturers are looking for
new ways to interact with customers
that's uh where we provide our main
solution pixudin as you can see
here on this uh
slide and that's why we need to frame
work bridge framework and our framework
to build community and to build
uh like you know
multi-chain now
yeah it's market outlook uh design
choice yes i like dandy i like sega and
i like cold games
uh and many people like pixel art we
make a little research about this too
that's why the main style of our first
boards was chosen pixel pixels pixlr
yep our little customer expectation
strategy
and our roadmap as you can see we have
already have
some points about our development but
actually it's tau integration with the
greek help by optus and um multichain
bridge yes
so uh next i will go to the website i
hope you can see it just second i will
share all my screen
so is the game
and first what we have done we easily
integrate the bridge
let's go to the
game
for example if i log out we can login
one more time
let's do it
just a second
by the way you can try it on game
pixely.com too
so uh later i will show you how we can
create the game
it can be a little slowly on my computer
because of zoom
but the first uh demonstration of pixel
develop and x2d uh bridge actually octus
rocks bro brock's success bridge
let's
uh
let's wait by loading
so yes it's connect my valid
so we can choose blockchain i will
choose for example error scale and
avalanche because we plan to integrate
this
i have some
evers
two
reptiles actually
and let's start our exchange process
so let's wait for
some
time
and while the transaction is
preparing
and we need to
wait for
checked by players i will try to briefly
show you the game
you can create a game
uh here we will be a little later add
the beads you can choose the beat and uh
as i
just a second as i show it on this
slide
yes
it's a design soon it will be
transferred to the website you can
choose
blockchain and you you can choose uh
currency okay
so we can create the game
example
and it will be like this
uh by the way if someone one now he can
join us
i will check
the transfer and we'll return to this
page
so it's currently checking
uh
while we are waiting for
checking i will
um
i will maybe open one more incognito
window and will show you how actually
work
this game hacks try to do it
very very
shortly while we're waiting for
bridge
okay let's choose another wallet
and i can join someone game for example
i have game
ever let's join
or maybe
my apps maybe i can join this game
somebody waiting maybe here for me
just one second
and
so
so uh as you can see by the way while we
are loading the game we need to release
the transfer in our launch let's do it
to check that a bridge is working in our
game
let's do it just one second
my meta mask is loading
uh sorry for speed again it's because of
zoom sometimes my browser becomes slowly
let's wait
please to finish our demonstration
maybe because i
upload the game
let's reload the page
oh i have it
you can see
that i need to sign the
transaction just a second i will do it
and
yep
i press the button and it's confirmed
now
so
uh we just need to wait for tokens
um
so
we create
uh so we're on the way to create the
game
we have already created something like
mvp of our project and by the way
for us this hackathon was a great
opportunity because we discussed about
integration payments and bridges a
little bit later but when i said
we decided
just do it and we did it we integrate
the bridge we are ready to integrate dao
and other and other and uh bid mechanics
on our in our game
and i think that it can be
very interesting that you can play
with uh
some people with different blockchains
in one in in one uh on one board
you can play it with different tokens
but using the bridge
we can play together
and get our tokens
play turn
game 5
nft some text it's pixuv
thank you very much
thank you so much so it's excellent
presentation and uh
well i have nothing to say so it's a
really cool product and
so i really enjoyed to see how you uh
integrated october's bridge technology
into your business flows
uh so uh now the time for questions so
guys uh is there any question from the
offline audience please
okay i have
slime
okay hi um
so have a question one question why
why do you need a token for in this game
what so why do i need to transfer tokens
from
some networks into this game what's the
point of the token in this game
you mean
talking for dao or talking for the game
we don't need special token for the game
in our game users the main the main
difference from other games that in this
game
uh
users can use any token from their
blockchain which we have in our uh in
this bridge in this bridge
uh that's why user can use
any different token
uh in this game uh we don't need special
so these tokens uh create a prize pool
for which participants are fighting for
right
so yeah
actually
okay thank you
thank you for the question thanks any
other questions guys please
raise your hand
okay maybe we have some online questions
no questions okay so thank you very much
guys for your presentation so excellent
work uh so
thank you for coming and participating
in our hackathon so uh now we
will wait a few minutes for the next uh
team to join
so uh
see you in a while
okay thank you
okay guys so uh we are ready to uh
listen to the pitch of the second team
so tin lap
uh so hope you guys are here with us so
uh please oh i see myself on tv
nice
so please
take the screen and show us your
excellent presentation
uh hello
hello
yes okay so our team his name is
certainly love so i'll share my screen
do you see my screen
so okay
okay hello everyone so today we will
demonstrate you our product and this
name is uh
curry
um
this platform is
uh
for
uh transactions of cryptoballots uh
cryptocurrency
uh
let uh
let introduce uh our team so uh we have
mobile uh developer front and back end
developer and i'm project manager
um we are from kazakhstan
so uh what about our project
our product as a multi-functional crypto
ballot of future development on web
freeno it technology
uh
this wallet can help to
do transactions of cryptocurrency
and
uh to to
fast manipulate with cryptocurrency and
also
to do payment with qr code
uh so
um our
uh see like traditional money will in
the future will not demand uh like uh
cryptocurrency
so and our project will
help everyone to
do transactions with a
future development so what we did during
hackathon so uh first of all we did a ua
ux design for website and app
and we have mvp website and app
for android
and also we did a little
market analysis
we
compared to it with
similar projects
and
i want to show show you uh the ui ux
design of our map
app
as you can see our app uh has uh
such features like
uh qr code uh
transactions of cryptocurrency
and a login
uh so uh this is our your uh design of
our website so uh
later i will show you evp and you will
see the functionality
uh we did a research uh
of our target audience
so uh we asked people from businesses
and who uh
like from our university and uh from
people in different countries who
who
works in the fear of cryptocurrency
and um
they say that the demand of uh
this currency uh
grow girls
[Music]
through time and as you can see in
january
not
much people use this currency and now
the
popularity of uh
this sphere is
growth every time so um what about
people
that people from all countries can use
our product
and age of course
18 plus and also uh
psychological who wants and likes to
um
uh use cryptocurrency
so um
we
saw that uh we can help uh the companies
like broccolis and everscale to
uh
to
[Music]
give and
uh recommend our
uh features of our app
for example we we can see that um
such companies has online have online
values access to crypto but we also can
demonstrate our qr code for payments
through cryptocurrency and also
multifunctional uh app with uh secured
data security
and which will help to
[Music]
store your old data
uh in
insecure place
so
what about monetization how will develop
this app
uh
we
we want to uh for for the uh for first
time to uh take
commissions from transfers
but also uh
we want to
uh
we want
all the companies invest in us and we'll
develop our app in the future more and
more
so what about milestones uh
uh we
develo during the hackathon we developed
our
um
idea uh into this uh
like uh cryptocurrency wallet
and uh in august we want to continue
developing android development market
analysis of course in september we want
to uh
connect hosting and develop our
front-end features uh then backend
banking
testing and
in in the winter we want to
uh
like test our
app and
continue in the marketplace
so uh what we need for the future
development uh we need
a good market analysis of course
to
compare with all the companies what they
need to
uh develop develop
in their app and uh
what is a demand in
market uh place
so
also we need to choose the right ipi
and ios
developers and of course finance
financial accounting is needed
so um
as you
you can contact me
i am project manager of our team so um
right now i will demonstrate you
our
uh
site
so uh with it during the hackathon with
it in vp of our site
can you see yes
so
um
this is our rep as you can see we
use css html javascript
you can see the features
uh in the end of our site you can
download our app
so and
of course you know we can uh change our
background to our site
uh then you can register it on our
site
so you can write here the name and
submit
and also you can
uh
write
the number of our cards
credit cards months here and cvv
and submit
and
this will be page your registration was
successful
go back
so um
now we will demonstrate our app
so
uh right now we will begin demonstrating
the uh ux ui design of our application
so uh here is
uh the main feature which we have used
everywhere it's called glassmorphism
which is being trendy and popular
in the recent years so that's why we
decided to use such design so as arena
had already mentioned curious
multifunctional crypto wallet of the
future development uh on web
development on web 3.0 internet
technologies created to facilitate
facilitate and improve the life of
cryptocurrency users so the main page
welcomes you with this message so
welcome to curie and as you accept all
the requirements you get started
clicking this button
then uh you will have to connect your
wallet uh there is no need to
register since uh the
future application will be connected to
the one of this
wallets mentioned so uh then
you have to connect
one of the partner wallets to work with
this application and the data will be
protected with
blockchain technologies and uh after
this uh you have to select one of the uh
mentioned cryptocurrencies uh crypto
wallets and then finish registration uh
then you will have the secret phrase
which will be also connected with the
wallet for example here uh we have the
meta masks and uh in this blurred
text area you have to paste the uh
secret message uh which will come to
your uh wallet then you press go
and uh the wallet will be
shown here and as you can see here is
the encrypted
encrypted number of your card with the
uh
like money and cryptocurrency available
uh and uh here is some uh
here is a button which you can uh
where you can see the available amount
of cryptocurrency in your world and it's
the profile then after uh seeing this
you can go to the receives and here uh
there are some
uh transfers which were done uh with
your wallet uh for example
here you can see received from uh
someone which you can see
uh which you can see and after this uh
you
have to say uh you see how many um
how many uh how much amount of the
cryptocurrency was transferred to your
wallet
and then you have the uh like feature of
scanning some qr and um
like purchasing something uh any service
uh and
any purchases you you can pay uh and
it's used in
all the areas of everyday life
it's only it's done uh with your own
crypto wallet using qr functions and
uh then the last but not least uh you
have transfers so uh as we have already
mentioned before uh you can also uh like
select the wallet which you can transfer
any amount of money from uh for example
here it's bitcoins and uh some user uh
available
like who was already registered in this
application and after uh some
manipulations you press the button done
and after
the amount of money will be transferred
to that wallet
so uh it's uh quickly uh about the ux ui
design and uh arjun will continue with
his uh prototype of the mobile
application thanks
okay hello everyone do you hear me
okay uh hello elder participants and
viewers i'm a member of the team
searcher lab my name is karimat zhang
glad to meet you uh now i would like to
present the mvp of our project
firstly i will share my screen
[Music]
okay
okay uh
do you see it yeah uh the application
was made on android but in the past and
to do also on ios uh when we uh firstly
um
first event we launch the application
[Music]
first we want to launch their
application
there will be a splash screen here and
firstly there will be information uh
about to accept the terms of agreement
after accepting this condition the user
gives permission about to use the data
uh further plans to make information
about wallace which is our partners
after that user choose a crypto wallet
which he will connect uh for example in
our case it's a popular wallet metamask
then as we know will be user
authentication for general example we
made a secret phrase
our words such as for example uh
covers purple
next
click this button and there will be
information about user profile uh
the main menu where they will
information about the user balance uh
his wallet token and on the top and the
bottom will be an overview of the wallet
where there'll be information about what
currencies the user has and in what
amount
future in the
registers
there will be information about the
about the receipt of funds or
values from different users who have
wallets and what amount uh one of the
main functions we which we want to make
is qr with the help of which in the
future will be improved the technologies
uh users can pay for any purchase with
the help of simple application uh
and the last section uh it's a fantasy
uh of our team it's a possibility of
improving and speeding up the process of
transferring to crypto wallets with this
application most likely this will be
possible in the future but definitely
today this idea will be an innovation uh
this all works
[Music]
okay uh
thank you uh for
attention okay
we have finished
thank you so much for presentation
the first question maybe will i ask
myself so actually how do you plan
to integrate the octus bridge or every
scale technology within your application
guys
um
planning to integrate the system uh by
uh
by connecting with the wallets uh for
example partner wallets it will be in
the future if they will accept our idea
and
yeah the cd innovation because
today we know
our technology is going to web 3
website and
in the future this will be really
innovation for example uh purchasing
something with qr it really uh will be
possible uh we think
okay uh and uh any plans uh for some
cross chain functionality for your
wallet
um
if you need this
if you mean uh about the question
multiplication or uh manipulations with
the walls you mean um
for example we have some uh cross chain
bridges for example uh
there are some
decentralized applications which are for
example like uh which are connected to
the meta verses and we can integrate our
application to the games for example the
game of the first team maybe
because right now the situation is uh
for example in our country we have got
an application uh which is called caspi
dot uh he said which uh
like holds all the uh money uh
which all the
citizens of the kazakhstan use it for
example uh we right now we are uh how to
say cancelling the
uh cash money and uh going to the step
of the uh holding money online which is
uh web2no but uh no one are no one is
holding a cryptocurrency in their
wallets and uh for example before kaspic
is that will integrate uh these
technologies there might be
like many years and if for example the
platforms or technologies like everscale
will integrate to our country to the
countries of central asia with
its destructionalized networks i guess
in the future
it can be a huge market like a new
market to
this platform
okay thank you uh is there any questions
guys from the audience please
yeah
hello
hey yeah so i just have a question about
the working process um what was the most
challenging aspect of putting this
together for you guys
to hear us so yeah i swear the
junior and middle developers of course
the blockchain technologies are new
facilities for us and i guess uh
the main
challenge for us uh
is the fact that in our country and
maybe in the cis countries which are
previous which were members so the ussr
uh the cryptocurrencies are uh like a
new uh market to uh like to integrate
into our countries and uh
right now we are totally dependent to
the for example uh any wallets any uh
virtual wallets uh since uh in our
countries there are no uh how they say
uh like we are the new uh players on
this market and that's why the main
challenge is that we are dependent on
the abroad technologies
okay okay thank you
okay thank you guys
any other questions
any online questions guys
nothing okay thank you so much for a
presentation
some applauses to you
so we will make again a short pose and
will continue at
12 am
12 pm
at the noon belgrade time thank you so
much
okay guys we're ready to uh listen to
the pitch of the next team everscale
guild who are offline here with us in
belgrade so guys please take a floor so
uh here's the camera
here's a mic so please
hello everyone uh we're team um
everscale guild
um
our team consists of four people
us two are front enders
and we also have
a full stack developer and the team
leader
ilyar
we also have one designer
that's our whole team and we made this
website
uh so yeah uh our team leader is eliar
but since uh it happens that uh i'm here
offline so i will present our project
um
so uh this is uh that's how it looks
um
[Music]
it's an app that um
kind of like rock paper scissors
it's basically the same but
uh
we rename it um so it's slashing never
write paper it's um
[Music]
it's um
like words from blockchain
it's uh that's what our
template
uh came up
so
uh yeah we have um
our logo our name and um
a list of uh beds
so basically how it works
first we log out
log into our app
we did the authorization
next
oh
yes and we also can uh
look out um we login with our wallet
and
[Music]
we have user one
for example
we'll call it alice and alice makes a
bet
she chooses either
rock paper or scissors she um set them
out of
coins that she will um
like pet
and
yeah she made a bed
and then uh another user uh you also
look into our app and he
uh see the pets that are currently in um
in the process and he can uh um like
make another bet to beat um alice
and um
so yeah bob makes uh opposite bed and
tries to beat at least he also chooses
rock paper scissors
and
next
oh
we also
the main idea was that we could choose
the wallet
so it would be the
cross chain
relations
we now have every scale and we could
could add metamask i'm not sure if
they are added it already but the main
idea was that we could do that
um could add any wallet and
[Music]
login and then um make a bet that's how
it looks in our app so we choose rock
paper scissors we
set amount of
coins and we also
um
it might uh
be another realization of random number
so uh why we need random number that's
because
uh when alice makes a bet
she
sends
her hash with her choice and random
number and
it
generates a hash
so um
she sent the hash and bob when he wants
also to make a bet he see the hash and
he
will be sure that it wouldn't would not
change
so
when he uh makes
another bite um
the
the shoes that alice made and the
original number um
she she has only um only she has that
secret
and
when bob makes another bet
um he
will see that um yes exactly that's the
same hash and she couldn't like
is there either way she could see that
he um
he would like paper and
she had um
rock and she couldn't change it later so
it would be fair
for a game
and yeah so after we click make a bet we
create a hash
under hood and
then the new bed will appear on the list
that's how
it looks now if someone click on the bed
and he will choose rock paper scissors
like um
and
he
beat it so if
bet was
answered so if someone make another bed
it would appear like uh and green
and if
it's
the bed hasn't uh been uh
processed by any anyone it's just uh
alice that make a bed and pop has none
answered it's in orange
so um
after um
yeah after that's what i just said
after bob makes a choice alice share his
secret and pop
well now if he won or not
and the coins that was
taken after ellis made a bet they will
be transferred
to the winner
[Music]
that's the schema of the our app
it might look
a little bit complicated but basically
what we
have like alice
bob
and
that's how
yeah how our server will practice it
what we
don't have right now it's a vault well
where
we ideally wanted to store uh the secret
that alice had
uh now we started in local storage but i
know it's not an
ideal scenario
are we working on it
so yeah uh alice makes um a bet
[Music]
it creates nft and bob then create
another to
beat
alice's bed
um
so that's
basically
the idea yes
um
what we have in our uh goals what we
want to improve
i want to yeah crocheting that's uh in a
process of realization we
i want to
like i said to make blockchain storage
to keep secret
and
show who won the bet right now we we
know it but it's not um we have to
improve our ui we have to show it like
um
to to the user that um
on front end so yeah
um
thank you and uh yeah also we have um
another platform where we
test our transactions um it's not on the
presentation but
um
there are
also um
we can there also make a bet we can
answer to it we can
uh redeem our price if everyone so
maybe if you would be interested i will
show it later
so
thank you
thank you guys so excellent presentation
uh so um same question as to the
previous team so uh what's uh the value
of the cross chain in your application
so how do you plan to use it
and how your application will evolve to
give more access to
your users from other networks yeah
so
the idea was that we could
if we don't have ever skill wallet or
have any other wallet we can use it to
make a bet or to beat someone's bed
so um
yeah that's was the idea
and what does
yeah maybe uh show you some of your
plans so on uh how you plan to evolve
this game maybe you have some other
games on your mind yes yes well uh what
i had here in the upcoming course uh
that's uh the main um like tracks that
we want to improve
uh and
yeah we're planning to
uh develop this project after a
hackathon um and we want to
um
well that that's my importance that we
want to prefer now maybe um we will um
um
ex
expand the variations that we have not
not just rock paper scissors
uh there are many other variations and
we can use to
create
more interesting game
okay thank you so much guys do you have
any questions from the audience please
so can i pick one thank you
yeah thank you guys for presentation
again and uh i have planning to realize
our game application
um
even uh when we uh finished developing
uh like release at summer uh yeah maybe
yeah uh we'll see how it goes uh i hope
that we can uh yeah release it uh
someday
okay i will wait thank you thank you
yeah i would definitely play for it
uh another question please i got two
questions is it is it your birthday
today yes ah happy birthday
and uh the second question is um so if
two people make bets that aren't equal
uh can they still play together or what
is what's the protocol do you have to
map the same amount uh they cannot uh
the
bob cannot
put like any other value that's uh like
automatically he put the same values at
his head
okay
thank you
okay another question uh yeah one more
question please so bets are made only in
ever coins right uh right now yes
okay so when you
[Music]
log in by metamask your assets from
metamask
transfer to
swapped to the everest right so that's
the whole point that's
how we
had it in mind but maybe in a process
we'll
had some other ideas
okay thank you
and how will bets be determined how will
the outcome of the rock paper scissors
be determined uh have you guys planned
on a
like a model that wouldn't be able to
people wouldn't be able to
determine what would be more
likely to land on whether it's rocks
papers or scissors
um you mean how um
how user would um
i don't
for the game itself
i think is that
rock beats scissors
well yeah but
i guess it's truly uh
on the people's choice so it's it's not
generated as i got from the presentation
not generated somehow on chain but
rather people select like a real game
okay okay
yeah thank you yeah and as i said we uh
we're planning to add more choices so it
wouldn't be just free yeah
excellent
do we have any online questions
not now okay guys thank you very much
for your presentation
uh and once again congrats with you was
your birthday
uh so uh
we will meet in 15 minutes so the next
theme and
so stay online
see
okay guys uh
our next participants uh will be the dj
hustle team so uh welcome please take
the lead
hello hello hello guys thank you so much
for
invitation
let me show the screen from my laptop
i will record myself from the phone and
the shorter screen from the laptop
hold on
yes
so did you see my screen
we do
okay
let's go so first of all thank you so
much for the invitation we have spent a
really great time by
doing such a project
it was really awesome because
i had such experience like a one and a
half year ago to spend all night
in
project generation so
uh
we are a dating hustle team and uh
in our team we have two participants uh
i am
like a product owner and uh my friendly
 like a creative director or
like a creative director or
a product designer and please
be careful degen means not what you
think firstly the again means
centralized generation
so
get ready please
uh
now the world is already changed
so uh we are moving from uh
normal finances from uh normal market to
d5
we have a lot of strategies we have a
lot of chains if you are using defy
products you are using it at all
everywhere you are using it in finance
smart chain in every scale and phantom
in avalanche etc etc
and
you have
such
strategies
so for example if you are not a noob
you are using defy on
chains uh with
some strategy like for example you can
start with a lending protocol you can
start with the native assets of the
chain and then you can borrow some money
to use it on d5 then you will have the
strategy with
two products so first product this is
landing protocol and second for example
farming
and
now you already need something to
control it to maintain it so
i if you also have a lot of strategies
on different chains you need
such a tool who will be
he'll allow you to control the situation
inside for example you need to
maintain your position in the landing
particle for example you need to change
the pools in farming because you see
a greater api on different farm farming
pool
and
what you need to maintain
how how you should just check it how you
should change your positions and here's
become
zapper debunk xayon yield watch but
all of this is little bit because
you have a lot of problems inside
such a projects didn't see your farming
positions didn't see new farmings new
pools
you cannot interact with it you have
some interactions like zaps so you can
make the bush transaction but you can
control your whole strategy
and here is the calm google sheets
whatever
uh
google sheets is like a
startup killer in the web too and also
startup killer and web 3.
and
from my perspective i use in the google
sheets and create
such a strategies
it's for me because
i
have no any choices i can use zappers
area et cetera et cetera and uh that's
because i'm using google sheets and i
even have an article about
uh the default strategies and how you
can control your assets uh by using
whole shoes because
you cannot use anything else you cannot
use
any dashboards you have no any strategy
viewers inside the defy
and
okay okay so we have only the google
sheets we have zappers area on debunk
and what to do what to do if i a
professional tj and farmer
or a
really high experienced defy enthusiast
and i don't have my
tool with strategies
so uh imagine oh this is the next
picture
imagine you are
a kid and
you are
playing with a lego so you'll create
some sense by using cubics and
you build it by yourself you can change
it you can
create it
inside different environments
and you're happy so uh
let me introduce to you the defy lab
farming strategy builder
we can start connect wallet but yeah
yeah hold on hold on we have a lot of
problems inside you say to me like what
the farming strategy
[Music]
hold on
non-custodial how it can be
non-custodial what about the changes in
strategies for example we will have some
changes inside the positions of the
lending protocols and what about the
updates so
we need to maintain a lot of stuff
inside a lot of widgets of
projects
and yes
you're right but
this is really non-custodial service
because we will have active auto
compound where triggers so we have the
page and the ability to
trigger the contract by uh any other
users like
protocol users or maybe developers who
create the bots so they can
just trigger the component
trigger the contract for auto
compounding for
harvesting and
for maintaining the strategy and after
the trigger
they receive some trigger fees
also we have the governments for all
beholders
for example if the strategy
uh need to change something
in landing protocol position so we will
have a status julenium protocol and then
alternative the farmer
if you're using this strategy you
receive the lps so
and you'll be able to propose
some voting in the governments to change
for example the borrow limit inside
lenin protocol and
if the lp holders decide to change it
contract will change and what about the
projects update so
we will have the update process
when
integrated projects inside this protocol
will have
ability to
just send us the pull requests we will
review it and we will update
the whole projects okay
we can move forward and uh we can start
so this is the main page
uh we created the prototype of
the app when we can build
your pharmaceutical first thing we need
to do is connect wallet and read the
disclaimer disclaimer is a really good
stuff
in our d5 rule so this protocol is not
responsible for your assets and the way
i don't plan to steal your money we have
our own money but anything can happen
and you should agree and sign this
disclaimer by using your wallet
after it
you will
go into the creative form
and
this is a
long part of my presentation so we can
start firstly with it and then we can
check my forms explore forms and
triggers
so we can start only with ever volume
because we cannot start with lending
protocol
with any other protocols
and
let's start never wallet okay we will
have it on our uh
on our desk
then we can set it
we put the we push the button of this
gear and we will have the balances we
will choose
the favor
we can choose like 25 15 percent okay so
we choose max
then we are able to
choose
we are able to choose any other product
so for example we will choose the
landing we will have the landing also on
our decks and we can draw this line from
the wallet to the landing after it will
set the language so we can
land wherever because we choose whether
from the wallet and we can borrow dye
for example also we choose
borrow limit
okay
uh then we are
want to participate with the farming in
the strategy so we can take the farming
from this
instruments and put it on our desks
then we can set it
for example we have the farming pools
like dire weather weather cube usdc
wherever etc etc we can have a lot of
farming pools a lot of projects
farming here so we have to dive ever
with 60 percentage epr
and
put the buttons there of slippage that
means
that
after the borrowing die we will swap die
into
whoever the half of it into whatever
with zero slippage so we are don't care
about the slippage if something changed
okay we also don't care about the price
in fact if you are using
one uh
dex one imm protocol behind this stuff
uh in any strategy where i don't care
about any price impacts about any
sleepage so you should just agree with
it
okay
then we
want to
[Music]
invest our rewards from flat tube
farming to our pools
so we are set
ever pulse
take it to the desk and we can set it by
choosing here
right uh
okay and uh then we have the full start
strategy so we have to start with the
error wallet then we are going to the
landing protocol to land together and
borrow diet and we'll go to flat tube
farming to
uh
farm
and then we
harvest all rewards swap it into
ever and earn error
so after it we can deploy the farming we
should enter the farming name the
farming description trigger fee
and the performance fee because we can
earn some money
by sharing our strategy with others
push the button confirm and deploy then
we approve everything for new smart
contract which was created from
the contract factory and then we push
the button run and we have our strategy
so we're now on the page my farms and
here we have strategies
this one the first strategy that we
created we can
for example
harvest or reinvest our owner rewards
because we are creating this strategy
and we have our owner fee we can update
a farm we can work vote for for foreign
updates and we can invest and withdraw
money also we can check the notification
and check the whole page to the strategy
let's check
here we have a description of
this farming strategy with some picture
we can open this hem with some info like
api apr the number of investors tvl uh
how much to out the compounded per day
the profit received risks and the fee so
you can see your stake here you can
check everything about your state you
can even hours harvest the reward
if the strategy have the reward because
if the strategy
uh final step is some staking or after
compounding you will have no reward here
only if your owner you will have the
reward
of
this strategy
okay somehow
for some
reason i cannot scroll below
one second
let me reload the figma file
okay now we are able to scroll
so
uh as i mentioned before we started with
the
uh part of the information for this
farming strategy then we have the
strategy update proposal for example
uh we will have the updates
like
behind the market situation
we can
for example maintain this strategy in
one case if you are using the lending
protocol in this strategy we can change
the portal limit so for example you
start with 60 percentage and we would
like to change it to 20 because of the
risks and you're like a participant of
this strategy able to propose an update
for the strategy
and all lp holders should vote for this
update
if
that they take the major
part of the voting
we will process these changes to the
smart contracts
also you have like a strategy owner
reward
this
block will be only if you are the owner
of the strategy and you are able to
reinvest this owner reward inside the
strategy or you're able to harvest
and some stuff behind it like a timeline
starts of the apy investors tvl
weekly and monthly and the risks points
when we integrate the products inside
i mean this
uh
by by saying integrate the products and
creating this
widgets with the products and some
setting insights on iterating the smart
contracts inside our protocol uh we will
set the risk parameters so for example
if we are using the imm protocol with
this strategy we will have impermanent
loss
risk will have some slippage and price
impact risks
uh let's go to explore farms
you can create farms here or you can
explore
farms of others
corner and you'll see how the
all major information about the firms
like epi pr risks investors performance
fee etc etc
and here we have the triggers and
these triggers help us to be
non-custodial so
we are
creating different contract for
different strategies we have like a
contract factory inside this product and
when you set your strategy we will
create
the
different contract for you and everyone
can trigger that contract for the
trigger fee
and
that's how it works so for example uh we
will
be able to earn a little bit more money
than past fees we will push the button
trigger
submit the transaction and
our contract will auto compound
everything hovers everything and invest
everything
this is an
mvp prototype which we made
during the hackathon night
let's uh move to the presentation
about the monetization models we have
the project monetization models firstly
the performance fee as i said from the
strategies but for the whole projects we
will take like uh
0.5 or 0.2
from all strategies of all users of all
assets then you can have the paid
feature section so for example
uh some projects some projects will be
happy to
pay us
for future their strategy
and we can have the enter integration
fee
inside the project monetizations for
example we can take the business
development behind this project and
agree with the new partners and
new projects inside our farming
strategies to be integrated by some fees
so we can charge from them like
enter ticket fee
also for the user incentives uh user
will have a
owner strategy fee so if you create the
farm you the pharmaceutical you can earn
the rewards like
0.1 percentage or 0.2 from
all performance
if
strategy will earn something you will
earn
the part
of all
also the trigger fee as i said before
and the uh one of the users saying gives
high yields from the strategies because
we have higher api and apr
behind all of these parts inside so
our projects brings the value beside
it's our
own
token and bonsinomics
to be honest for now we have the time
when we have a lot of tokens a lot of
ponzis and
from my perspectives the great projects
can work without own token because a
compound can work without talking
unislope can work without talking
synthetics can work now synthetics scan
without talking because we are
length uh
synthetics
so we have the parts of the projects
which
are working without the token and
after it if we will have the value from
this product we can create some token
for investors for the users even here we
have that economic feature because we
have a lot of user insane tips like uh
own strategy fee
we will have uh
the rewards uh in a strategy we'll have
the owner rewards and we'll have the
trigger rewards and uh
because
of the projects inside the strategy and
talking of these projects we will have a
lot of ways
how to
pay this reward and we can
buy back rapid ever under the hood for
all rewards and then distributed behind
all users
or available to harvest
and
that can
like
increase the price of
rapid ever or of any other tokens maybe
our own token if we decide to create it
but
i
don't want to create it because
we are
trying to be a product which
create the value without depositing
without the tokens
and seriously how do we
launch this product
so firstly we should validate an idea in
the hackathon then we should assemble a
team from the dayton castle community
that's my community with a lot of d5
farmers and different enthusiasts that
we can uh have a grant from the
ecosystem for mvp then we can pitch to
funds for the first round like a 2-3
millions then we can develop large mvp
collect analytics and calculate the unit
economics and then we have another pitch
for the phones to the second round for
five millions and uh finally developed
in product piece
and why way i choose everscale so define
every scale there is an initial stage
and we have lower gas fees but the first
one is a major different initial stage
because
we just have
a few products which we can simply
integrate and
then continue our growth with these
products and
it will help us easily integrate any
older products after it
and
what did we miss in the prototype so
we worked
a lot with my friend we spent all night
but we missed some features the one
feature we missed is the setting the
coffee sense to maintain strategy for
example
in the voting process you will be able
to
vote in some
coefficients and before it in the
strategy you should set it so for
example the voting can be
in changing pools in some farming
strategy or in changing oral limit in
the landing particle also we are lose
the entire process of devoting and
accepting changes because
we create this user flow
we will have like 15 screens in it
also you lose the private strategy
because uh someone's don't want to see
they don't want to share
your
own strategy and uh
it's a really powerful feature because
uh i just saw the opportunities i want
to create the strategy and
even we are miss the strategy clubs or
the strategy groups for example they can
come together with five or ten people's
chest shoulder strategy and that's it
with any other kids also that means the
assets analytics so within our strategy
in deep i mean we'll have a lot of
assets inside the strategy and we should
have the analytics behind it so for
example in the whole strategy i would
love to see
uh the risk parameters for the lending
protocols like how much money we already
borrowed how much money we are landed
what's uh the collateral factor what's
the borrow limit just to understand is
it safe to invest or not
also build the strategy approval process
uh we have some ideas how we can improve
how how we can uh maintain this process
like for example after
the
half a million
tvl inside the strategy it becomes
public or we can review it by our hands
or
it will have like a voting process uh
from
the
other strategy users
also will lose
about five pop-ups
in our prototype and infinity of
tooltips because there we should have a
lot of tool tips to explain everything
for the user
and
thank you so much i'm really happy to be
a participant on this hackathon
uh we're
like
spent a really great night
and
we can
continue with the questions if you have
so
yeah
excellent presentation guys uh so uh the
first question is typical so pretty much
uh like to any other team so uh how do
you plan to use uh
cross chain and specifically october's
bridge in your technology
and uh
which specific protocols would you
target who is it uh we are having no any
plans to use the cross chain and
bridge inside this product because it's
useless
for this product we cannot create a
strategy like cross chain strategies
because we have a lot of problems inside
for example you can
hold the money on the on on the first
chain in the lending protocol and then
trying to use the breach
and
use the farming on the other chains
if something happened behalf this part
you will lose your whole strategy and
you lose your whole
assets inside so it's really uh like a
risk factor for this type of product of
using the cross chain first what we
should do is the mvp on only one chain
with like three or five projects after
it we can think about the cross chain
but uh behind this uh have a lot of
problems
okay
any other questions guys please
yes we actually have one question from
our community
so
is there any code ready for digging
hustle
this is the question
is there any training is is there any
code ready for digging hustle no no no
we have no any
codes behind it we have no it helps we
don't write any line of the code because
we are participating in uiux perfection
and
we have no coder in our team for this
hackathon
okay any other questions guys please
nothing uh okay thank you very much for
the presentation once again and
so we will be welcoming our next
participant in three minutes
okay thank you so much
hello mr dj
okay guys uh so it's now time for the
next team uh w3u i'm here
okay i see excellent so go on guys
please
okay
are you with us
uh-huh
oh yeah okay
one second please
um
[Music]
do you see yes yes yes we do
okay
uh hello everyone uh today we would like
to
show our product called short hub
we put a lot of work
this idea was inspired by
vitalik buterin
and his white paper about soulbound
token
where there is an idea
the trust is ensured by reputation
our solution includes several tokens
reflecting a use of reputation and
allowing to transfer these tokens
between
several blockchains
via ever skill cross chain
right now uh
it supports uh everscale and ethereum
but in the future
we will add
supporting another
blockchains
today everybody knows how it's important
to
provide end users
[Music]
opportunity to interact with uh
product
without any problems uh because a lot of
a lot of projects today
uh give more attention technology
than more
[Music]
than more interface that's why we create
a website with convenience and nice
interface where users easily understand
how to get their reputation and use it
on different services of web free
[Music]
okay okay yeah
so
our product uh right now is just a
website uh that is like showcase for our
further
work and what it does is actually
uh have the uh like step-by-step guide
how the future users gonna
like
interact with other uh further library
about the library i'm gonna talk a
little bit further
so um
the um on the website we have like the
connection of the wallet and uh the
button that computes the reputation for
the user for the current uh address
uh and i guess
after the reputation is computed he can
produce
the
soul bound token on the everscale
or and
further transfer this
token on other blockchains
so yeah um
the next uh site
okay so what is the actually our
reputation token um so our reputation
token is uh actually is a non-functional
token
so after the user is
tapped on the button on the website the
reputation uh for him is computed um
let's take a minute and i will explain
you how we right now compute the
reputation
so um other um current uh technology
interacts with the octus bridge api
so uh right now the formula is not that
complicated um
because it's temporary solution
and
how it works it's um
checks for the address all of his
transactions on there
every scale and count their amounts
and divide them by the old transaction
he has and this is the current
reputation
but i wanna repeat it's a temporary
solution
so
uh this uh
this number reputation is put uh put it
into a non-funchable token this
non-fungible token is our sbt
uh and um uh
after the all of this these
interactions
the
svg is finally minted and deployed on
the network
on the everscale blockchain
and
what user can do about it he can um
transfer it to other chains i can give
you a brief example
let's imagine that we have one
developer and he builds a product for
um allowing people
uh
uh to
uh compute their reputation on every
scale
so he uh he simply uh
uh he or she uh connects um our library
and
um for one line of code and he can
easily
uh compute reputation from uh for the
user
let's imagine um another scenario we
have other developers who
are working on uh for instance the
website for landing
um on ethereum
uh so uh and they wanna to allow to use
uh like they wanna
um only specific amount of users use
their function functionality so what
they can do they can
also import our uh
library and uh
like one line of code for instance um
check the user's uh
reputation
sorry it's my cat
and
this reputation is
easily gathered from every scale and if
it's good then
they can allow user to use the landing
if not
it's not allowed to
and
all right current smart contracts are
written on solidity and deployed
on the network using clock lift
i want to talk a bit more about the
implementation
uh so um
um there is one one big problem uh
because um when the user created a
soulbound token on
ethereum blockchain um he
cannot transfer it to um
other chains because uh current
octus bridge not allow to transfer the
non-functional token
so we have a simple
uh hack for this
uh this hack is um
like using uh uses the functional token
so this uh reputation uh is
from non-tangible token goes to fungible
token this punchable token is
transferred to uh another chain using
octus bridge and uh on the other chain
um
we produce a sl bound token this is a
temporary implementation but they think
that the next versions of ocus breach
can allow us to easily
transfer all bound tokens
uh
yeah
next
it's really simple other developers can
um uh implement the connection on the
wallets and
import our library this library can
either
compute the reputation of the user uh
and creates album token or it can breach
uh um
uh this um uh like uh soul bound talking
to other chains
yeah or request from other chain the
reputation from over every scale
there's so many scenarios
[Music]
okay
the next slide please
oh well excuse me for a minute um uh
timothy can you please uh
uh
continue
okay okay
uh this is our team and
right now maybe
i would say several sentences about uh
future
uh
how romance had
we created a website and we implemented
several tokens it's fungible talking and
non-fungible talking
but in the future
we think
it was
it will be only one fungible one
non-fungible token
and this token
will be transferred between blockchain
and uh
to
reflect uh users reputations
um
[Music]
maybe
that's all thank you so much
yeah thank you
thank you guys excellent presentation so
um actually just a small commander uh
yeah in fact uh octus bridge doesn't
support the nft transfer for now but uh
because there are a lot of situations uh
that you need to tackle uh in terms of
nfc transfer but we plan doing this in
the nearest future so it's already in
development
um yeah so actually uh my first question
uh to you uh
would be
what kind of scoring do you see
to check the reputation would it be an
aggregate score for uh
for a user or rather it would be split
into categories
um i can answer this question please
um our librarian can be easily uh
changed
because other developers can for
instance pull uh edit pull request into
it or
rewrite the whole algorithm for
computing the reputation
if other developers think that a current
algorithm is bad it's bad
uh to be honest they can easily
create their work and edit the algorithm
maybe choose their own apis
uh yeah
it's really like scalable solution
customizable also yeah
okay thank you uh do you have any
questions guys
uh for now we don't have any uh
yeah uh okay do we have some online
questions yeah
okay in this case so thank you again
guys for your presentation i really like
the ideas that you tackled on so do you
have actually any code in place
yeah yeah we have um the implementation
of the website um
so you can check it out or we have not
fully built smart contracts uh yeah
and because we have limited amount of
time but if we like had more time we
would
make a lot of like better products okay
super and do you plan to continue
working on this project
yeah it's yeah of course because we
think that the idea of uh like soulbound
tokens is um
really
right now
uh so
like
um like so great and no one implemented
actually but we can be the first uh one
who build it
yeah it's really interesting excellent
okay thank you guys again for for coming
for presentation participation in the
hackathon so now we will make the break
for the lunch so and so we see each
other so according to the agenda
something like
2 30pm if i'm strong so uh
bill great time
2 pm bill great time
okay thanks
okay thank you a lot bye
okay guys uh so time for our next
participants uh the identics team so
guys are you here with us
perfect hi hi there
so uh please take the screen and share
your presentation
yeah sure just give me
30 seconds
okay how much time do i have for the
presentation for the demonstration uh
you have something like 20 25 minutes
depends on the number of questions so i
would target 20 minutes to leave some
some space for for questions if any yeah
that's fine
can you see my screen yes
cool so let's get started
uh first off we are ident xsbt team
which attempted to create a solution for
this separate decentralized reputation
for the ever scale community i suppose
that uh everybody's everybody heard
about
a paper that was published by uh vitalik
buterin in authorship in may 2022
on the case of uh decentralized
reputation on ethereum and other
blockchains
where he proposed uh to create a kind of
uh
core smart contract which is called
seoul and to associate with this smart
contract other
uh non-fungible tokens
which called sbt sold bounded tokens
which can
demonstrate some reputational events
that are related to a
specific person
so uh we observed the landscape of the
everscale community and decided that
okay there is still no
proper sbt implementation and we decided
to employ to employ uh vitalik's
architecture and create
maybe one of the first nodes but one of
the first
blockchain
solution
on the sbt architecture so today i am
going to demonstrate you uh like our use
case and our
definition of gun what we really did
during this uh two days of friday and
saturday and um what we managed to do
and what we are going to do with it
further
uh so bringing some context to this
intro to the case of decentralized
reputation i support that
everybody understand that uh there is
kind of a problem in the field of web 3
where we have said anonymous accounts
numerous of them and we still do not
know uh how many real person like human
beings are using uh
any blockchain ecosystem including
everscale
and that's the problem for
all investors for all projects because
uh there are lots of botnets that
simulate
like kind of activity economical
activity uh which can be then used to
get significant air drops from battery
services therefore uh like we believe
that current air drop paradigm is not
effective uh and we believe that there
must be kind of
reputational events which are provided
and verified by human beings or by
organizations which can prove that this
account is real it is not just some kind
of economical activity which is
performed by botnet uh like this person
is real and this person performs certain
activity that is appreciated by third
parties
uh the other point is that uh many
people in uh the world of web 3 they
don't have a clear
user journey roadmap when they onboard
web3 ecosystem they still do not do not
know what to do here
and that's kind of a problem and we
believe that the system of decentralized
reputation may create a new system of
incentivization for these users if you
understand that if you gain a certain
reputation uh
work in a proper way or do something in
a proper way join dials make certain
contributions create nft collections uh
that can be recorded and all these
reputational events later can be used uh
by you to get bonuses benefits access to
what uh clubs or whatever
therefore we believe that uh like
decentralized reputation is a good case
for a
proper web 3 user journey map
and we decided to use the architecture
that was proposed by vitalik
during our implementation but in our
implementation we created a sole
contract which is a controller for
reputational events for sbts sold bound
tokens and we created sbts as well we
created three spd's
uh like
these
contracts were created on the basis of
uh
tip four token like nfc token itself and
we uh additionally created the
collection for uh these tokens
uh we did not manage to create a social
recovery mechanism because like it
requires several more days to implement
and we did not um
prepare for this hackathon in advance
uh therefore uh like social recovery is
not something that that we are going to
do in
our next milestones
of the project
so some words about like our use case
uh we created a system of uh
achievements which were received by a
person
uh
in advance for example you used um
for example octopus bridge or you used a
flat cube for quite some time and you
traded a lot and you had a pretty pretty
good volume so you receive uh an
achievement from this third-party
services that okay this soul uh and this
person uh is really good now like
he or she uh
did lots of good stuff in our ecosystem
or traded a lot or made lots of
transactions therefore we will uh award
this person an achievement that like you
are like dex master or like cocktails
british master whatever
uh so the person receives this uh sbt
slow bounded token which is associated
to his sole contract and then the person
imports uh his uh sbt to our service and
uh the verifier like and and you like
for example decentralized exchange
verifies these sbts
checks these smart contracts checked his
his soul
and uh then he allows to perform certain
actions for on this platform for example
give the access to a
like
huge
like trade movie limits or something
like this or from a great
leverage
for trading
so uh in our case like uh sole contract
is uh pre-issued and you start with sbt
issuance
uh like we also like issued uh these
sbts and then you import it
and
like when you import it then you proceed
proceed with the presenting it then this
contracts to the verifier and the
verifier automatically checks uh your
sbds
uh we decided to simulate some backend
logics uh most of the like of the
verifications and checks are performed
on the front end and because of like
lack of time for us
so and now i would like to demonstrate
you uh the use case itself and then i
will proceed with my presentation
so uh firstly we should uh
insert here like firstly obviously first
we should connect our wallet of course
yeah we did everything on the test net
okay i connected my wallet but then
uh
i should it may take some time
so please be patient
then i should insert our sew contract
address
you can find it in the test net
so i logged in with my sole contract
address and here you can see that
this verifier requires me to provide him
three
uh sbts like that i am experienced
trader that i am cross chain master and
then that i am a premium club member so
like conflict coupon office bishop black
grandpa's that obviously is just
fictional
sbts
which can be made in future
and here you can see like like the
address of the collection
where you can find this
spts so
uh what i'm gonna do next
uh
next i'm going to
import
uh
our
sbts
so i should insert enter sbt token
address
uh and during my demonstration i will
just import two tokens and mint another
one
okay here i can
just wait for a second
it may take some time
because everything is live
okay
okay i inserted my collection address
and here i can find
nft address and then address for the
personality
and
insert it here
okay imported the first one
then
i'm importing
the second one
so when i'm now i'm going to
add the third one
let me just wait for a second let's mint
it
a private club member
remains
okay
so address
oops
remove the keyboard
sending a message
so waiting for the fastest test net
okay
it's done
yeah it's here
so i'm copying the third nft address
and important so uh here we have like
kind of automated uh verification scheme
because we decided to hard hold it
because like basically this verification
skill depends on the
needs of a certain verifier if for
example this my awesome exchange will
need much more
um
like sbts from various collections not
from the one collection obviously they
can
create their own data scheme and
this data schema can be performed on the
smart contract so basically we can do
everything uh on chain but it is
something that we are going to do
in our further milestones
so uh let me proceed with
my presentation
here is like our definition of done sole
contract sbt insurance model
sbt collection and like front-end app
for demonstrating the use case and
verification of the sbts so everything
you can find in our github repositories
and some words about further steps
we would like to proceed with the
development of the social recovery tool
because we believe that it is of huge
importance uh people may uh lose their
keys they may want to transfer
uh like
some parts of their reputation uh
but it's not an orthodox scheme for
vitalik but anyway
uh
obviously we want to automate like the
soul creation because like in this use
case it is hardcoded but we want our
users to create uh their their own souls
in uh
user-friendly interface without using
ibs and jsons and
copying addresses as i did in our
demonstration and we would like to
create the verification that data scheme
uh for
any um
like
ever scale community participant because
we believe that uh this use case is of
huge importance and uh that's how every
scale community may create clear
incentivization path for uh like
newcomers that are coming from other
blockchains and uh that can be can that
can be a distinctive feature
that uh
will move uh every scale to the top
so that's it some credits to my guys who
participated in this hackathon um like
i'm very grateful that they worked hard
because they expected that the deadline
will be on sunday but it appeared that
it is it was on saturdays therefore we
worked uh the whole night from friday to
saturday therefore thank you guys it was
an amazing job i'm really proud of you
so
thank you thank you everyone for giving
me the opportunity to demonstrate our
use case
thank you very much so excellent
presentation guys
uh so the first question traditionally
so how do you plan to
use octa's bridge technology so within
your product
well basically we can use octopus breach
well uh um
when the oculus bridge will implement uh
cross chain entities obviously that will
be the greatest case from my personal
perspective the greatest case for
cross-chain reputation
so we are waiting for this solution
because uh
basically you can create sole contracts
which will be controlled in the rescale
network and you may create sbts in other
networks and oculus bridge may
be a tool for managing this therefore we
are waiting for this technology stack of
focus breach
okay thank you
do you have any question guys
nothing so uh thank you so much for
pitching your project uh
so
i i enjoy you joining us this hackathon
so and we will see each other in 15
minutes with our next team
thank you
okay guys so uh we are ready to listen
to our next participants uh mycelium lab
guys are here
perfect please speak closer to the
microphone because it's
very quiet
okay
no better thank you
uh can you see my presentation yes
um hello everyone my name is emily our
team presents a project called everboy
at the hackathon we created nft game
cartridges
that can contain chip 8 byte code
and nft marketplace smart contracts
also we created a web application in
which you can buy an nft cartridge and
play it on our web emulator
uh chip 8
is a virtual machine of old
8-bit games like
space invaders
pacman
our
target audience
in the first picture
we can see game cartridges collectors uh
like me
these people
like new technologies
retro video games
game consoles
they are
our target audience
in the second picture we can see a retro
assembler game developer who post his
games on github
and has some audience on youtube or
telegram
uh to these people we will give an
opportunity to sell their games on our
marketplace
not only for their audience
after the packaging is over we will
start preparing our platform to launch
to do this we will refine the technical
part
uh as well as write old games and create
new original games
in order to avoid copyright problems
uh
no later than a month after
the end of crypto inter we will going to
place our nft games on third-party
platforms and conduct a marketing
campaign to attract users to our
platform
we hope that the funds
raised
in the first phase
will help us to add online idea and
high-level
language compiler
uh so that more developers will be able
to sell their games on our platform and
pay us five percent fee ah they also
some chains
of releasing nft cartridges in
conjunction with nintendo they will
never pass uh
up an opportunity to sell old games for
the price of new games
here
you can see our interface
this is
our games
uh
and uh
emulator looks like this
uh then i will um
i will show
the demo
uh
some features that we're going to
implement after the hackathon
uh future you can add emulator frame to
you web applications that can allows
users
to play
chip 8 games
when they are waiting for transaction
confirmation or something else
this will help users stay on your
app longer
i also want to create online idea like
octoproject to
[Music]
chip 8 bytecode which can help
helps chip 8 game developers
create test and sell their games
thanks
let's watch
live demo
uh
this is uh
my games
uh like uh
tank pacman tetris
second
space invaders
then
we can see the market
this is my games but i can buy it
for example
let's play
[Music]
games
for example space invaders
uh maybe
fun game
um
a russian invasion
here
we can
drop the bombs
for the
peaceful town
tetris
and that is all
okay guys uh thank you so much so a
traditional question uh
so how do you plan to leverage uh
the octopus bridge technology for
example uh for your game
um
we
we can
connect
uh other
chains
uh
for example fbm chains
like a polygon
ethereum
binance to
uh
buy
nft cartridges on our marketplace
okay thank you
are there any questions guys please
we have one question
uh well maybe you already said it but i
will be available on mobile i think
mobile gaming right now is more suitable
for these kind of games than
desktop
um
our
nearest plans are targeted to
web up games
and
old retro games
but
we can
in future create a framework or
library to swift or
[Music]
react native uh
that can help
mobile gamers
play
their
nft games
on the
mobile platform
thank you i don't get this right that
the source code of the bytecode of the
game itself of these stores inside the
nft
yes yes
cool
that's totally cool
uh okay if there are no more questions
thank you guys for your presentation and
uh in
20 minutes so we will listen to other
participants thank you so much
goodbye thank you
okay time for
another team so eternal labs so please
come to the floor
we'll be presenting
take your ticket mic
do you need one more
uh two more
two more okay i have only two
so please
shall we
uh do you have your slides yes yes
did you send them to the guys
yes
presentation
i'm not sure
okay we have technical difficulties just
a second
guys please output the presentation so
you guys will forward
you can use the hdmi yeah
okay
it will be visible
on the stream
okay
okay perfect we see it
well hello
uh
it is nice it is a pleasure being here
and um
i hope you're all having a lovely day
uh we are
uh team eternal
uh we come from novi sad and we have
made adele factory
uh
just second
uh
shall we come here
we have made
the doll factory smart contract uh
for uh developed for users uh to be able
to create their own dow
uh with much more ease than usual
uh the idea behind it is to make octus
bridge even more uh decentralized
by giving every user the possibility to
manipulate their own dow in their on
their own accord
uh the dell factory contract deploys an
existing optimization contract uh dal
route thus making integration with octus
bridge simpler
uh
dow factory
dot sol contract written in solidity uh
is created based on contracts that are
already uh
in the octus bridge
that it uses and it relies on them in
order to make uh the root contract
deployment uh possible
it consists of two methods uh the deploy
method uh
which is the heart of the contract and
it's based on the platform code and uh
proposal conf
configuration struct uh containing
information about voting its duration
etc uh and deploys the new down returns
addresses of the deployed dolls
withdraw gas is the second uh method
it use
if a user wants to
uh abort the deployment for any reason
uh gas for deploying the new dial will
be transferred
to the address specified in the function
functions parameters
uh in the next few steps uh we will uh
these are the commands that should be
typed in uh in order to generate
the desired output
so
these two steps
are
used to generate the code and save it to
the dell factory.code file and we shall
create the api
and it's going to be stored in the
abi.json
dell factory.api.js
the third one
is um
as you can see uh it outputs the path uh
in the
path from the input
then
it is compiled save to the dollar
factory tvc and the contract address
that uh is used
also
these are the
uh next few steps uh the commands uh
will get the raw addresses uh and uh
after that uh
address of the deployed contract
um
i don't want to take more of your time
by looking at this
uh
so we get to the dow
daru deployment
uh so after the successful uh deploy
deployment of the owl factory
you will need to generate the
platform.tvc file
in order to decode it and use it for the
dial deployment
later
these are the next few commands that
should be used to achieve it
uh and this should be the generated
output
uh
then
we can go to the next step
uh dolph uh this is how uh
uh
so in these steps we are using the
ever bitey
executor
we will input the address of the
deployed contract and load the abbey
file so that we can see all of the
functions that are available
in the deployed contracts
uh in this step we are using the address
of the dao factory so that we can deploy
new dao root
okay so
here is the
output when we clicked on the search
button
it consists out of
constructor uh the deploy method and
withdraw gas method
we will call the deploy method for
deploying dow root
so
when we click on the deploy method
there will be
parameters that are needed for the dow
root constructor constructor so that a
new download can be deployed
so first is the platform quote
that is the decoded code from the
platform.sol
contract
next is the proposal configuration
configuration struct
which consists out of
the next parameters that are necessary
for
deploying new proposal through the dow
root
and then when we fill out all the
parameters we will click on send
external
so that
the contract can interact with each
other and deploy the new dow route
and this is the output
of
of the method deploy
and the
the return value is the address of the
new deployed contract the dow root
contract
yes
and
that's about it
and that's about it okay guys
thank you so much um so do you plan uh
on extending this functionality to a
fully functional so think with
interfaces and
yeah yes yes
we were thinking about
making the
interface
we were thinking about making the
interface like
uh
in the flat cube for creating the new
custom token
something like that so that the user can
input their own
parameters and just click
uh deploy the
or create the perfect will it be
possible to update the dow
configuration after the deployment uh it
should be
should be okay perfect uh and uh in
which way so uh this new deploy dao so
facilitates interaction with uh octo
bridge
uh can you repeat the question
you said that uh this way so we need to
play your own down so you it will be
much easier for you to interact with
octus bridge then so can you maybe give
a bit more details about uh how you see
this work
uh well i see it work
our our primary idea was to make it uh
for the
new octus bridge feature that's why it
is deploying the dow root contract from
the octus bridge contract okay
but
any user can
use it for their own platform just to
adjust
the parameters
and
the configuration needed
okay thank you so much guys do you have
any questions
uh please take the mic so that's our
remote people could hear as well
so
do you
have a plan to improve your solution is
after deploy is taking contracts and
automatically
configure this
with
new dao
we didn't think of that so far but you
gave us a great idea
thank you
any other questions guys please
maybe something online
thank you for excellent presentation so
uh thank you for uh for your
efforts and uh so we have uh only one
team uh left if i'm not wrong so uh
so let's listen to them in 20 minutes
thank you guys thank you as well
okay uh so uh last but not least the
evereef team so uh we'll be presenting
as a solution now so it is
the last of the teams on our list after
which
the jury will go for the final decision
making
uh
so
yeah guys from evereef are you here
guys
hello
it seems they decided not to pitch
okay let's give give them a minute so uh
so but in case they are not coming in a
minute so then we will skip this speech
and we'll go for decision making this
case
hello
yes finally super i'm here
please share the screen with us and move
on
yeah just give me a second
okay uh do you see
yes yes we do
awesome um so let me start from the
introduction
uh my name is daniel i am a ceo of
evereef
entertainment application
that allows to host
and join parties
in virtual
real environment
so anyone can start their own
event or party
uh in any place of the world just by
using the application that is now
available on ios only for
cypriot users
and
they
can earn money and tokens from
participating those events
so let's break down the
core loop of the
application
so because of the
model of the applications it is closed
so
not any not everyone can actually um
register in the application because
a user needs to have some special qr
code
so that he could access the application
and register himself
so we have we have example of john who
is not a user of evereef but his friend
alex has qr code and he already
registered in the application so alex
can share his qr code as an actual as an
activation link
to
for john to join and register himself
um
straight after uh when when john joins
uh the brave he receives one token
called irv talking don't mix it with
every scale packing like different names
so
at that time john
owner of qr code he has some special
costume that allows him to earn tokens
just just because of um
inviting people
from through his qr code
so how does actually work he has costume
that is broke
is broken down into four parts uh first
part is the head
second one is body third one is legs and
fourth one is feet
uh this is very similar to vulcan io
application
on step and move to earn
but
in this case
those four parts of the costume allow
user to
increase and enhance the earning rates
of
our native token
so uh first attribute that
part of the costume has is popularity
popularity is the
discount on
events that user can pick to enter some
events because we have several events
arranged so first event can be some
small party in lima soul
with 20 people
and that's it
and
second one is closed party only for
uh very good programmers and it's paid
party so not everyone who wants to join
can actually join
so they need to pay some money so if you
have very high score of popularity you
can decrease
the price you need to pay to join this
party so you get discount
so another attribute is accessibility
accessibility uh allows you to attend
different events
so if you have very low costing you
cannot join
some uh very good
and
valuable events such as
exhibition of
like startups if you if you see
uh
and you cannot and you cannot join like
some
exhibition this elon musk for example if
he wants to create some room in skype
zoom or in reality
so by having the epic
rarity in costume you can actually allow
yourself to join this event and
start earning even more money in there
so the third attribute is called luck
this is the
rev this is the percentage of
probabilities that you get
if you want to receive a part of the
costume
so once you open the application in your
city
and you can open them up and you can see
some points of event on the map and you
can pick for example every scale
hackathon
so you can press
join button just like here we have
exclusive crypto punks for example
once you once you've joined this this
application you can now get to it
and
start on
hunting for those costume parts so if
you've played pokemon go there is a
special technology for
augmented reality where you can open the
camera and catch pokemon in our case
this is exactly the same
you can
actually get some
very rare item of your costume just by
opening the camera and catching the uh
part of the costume
so the fourth one is littleness this is
chances of receiving extra event tasks
so if you want to increase and get even
more tokens from the events that you uh
participating now you can
actually get this if you have very good
question
and the last one is durability it shows
when you would need to repair your
costume to keep it using
so those items they they can be
purchased on marketplace or they can be
hunted
on different events just like in pokemon
you can also upgrade the level of them
you can increase the
perks and you can transfer them to any
metaverse you want such as the
centerland or any other like it's like
sandbox and you can use exactly the same
visual
uh part of the costume in reality so
after some time in our future roadmap
you will be able to
order the exactly the same physical
version of the costumes which you have
on your character in our application
so let's get back to the core loop now
we have decomposed the
costumes
so once the user joined the event he
needs to activate his geolocation on his
phone and press button
start
right from this application will um
receive information about the costume
user has
and give him specific hourly rate
of tokens he can earn while he is uh
participating in this particular event
so after the event the ending he can go
to workshop he can upgrade he can repair
he can
make something better with his costume
and lastly he can decide okay guys i
want to sell my costume and buy some
something new
uh and the loop starts again
um
i'm not sure if i can ask whether you
have questions i don't need to continue
uh i think that you
need to go on so and we will ask
questions at the very end okay no
problem
okay
currently we have two clients
of this application
first one is on ios
we have made it with swift and second
one web client
it's react and jungle
so we
are looking for
our teammates we want to
get more team members in our team so if
you have some experience so you know
somebody who can
create smart contracts or help us with
any of the
uh served stock
technological stack please please chat
chat with me and direct message me
uh this this so this is our four
features that is available now you can
create uh a party in any location you
want so let's say decentraland you want
to create party metaphors you can pick
any date you like you can make it
physical like in europe in your city
with physical joining or you can join in
metabolism and party there and you can
make it paid for free
with 345 years for example also you can
integrate your entities that you have in
your wallet now and customize the
profile
you can also see
the statistics of how many array events
you've organized and visited
you also can
chat with your friends
and join any events on the map or in
virtual reality
so
when it comes to the marketing
we don't require
much
uh spending and marketing because we
want to go through community
uh this is why we decided to create a
task pool mechanism
that allows pretty one every user to
take particular task
completed and receive tokens
so how it actually works
we have
alex who is a youtuber he has 2 000 of
subscribers on youtube
and he is in his years
uh if you
bring
100 people
and register them in every eighth we
will receive 100 tokens
so and he asks him asks himself can i
actually do it do i have enough people
in my subscriptions to complete this
task and if the answer is he can pick
this task he can bring those hundred
users and he will get a hundred tokens
to him that he can
later use in our marketplace
and further on also we have season pass
it's a limited time event
like
you can just fulfill some tasks such as
take five pictures of different bars
become started brave make three videos
or add five reps to your wishlist so you
can also receive those daily tasks
on daily basis
so
let's talk about the monetization for
business
uh what differs us from the step and and
vulcan is that we have a more stable
economic model so we know that
in step and it pretty much depends
depending on
how many new users
will come to the application and
purchase their tokens and purchase
sneakers
in our case we have reverse model
because
we also have perspective of user and
also we have perspective of the business
who
or any host who wants to host event or
party
so
they would need to
use their resources uh to make it look
better and unique so they can actually
uh go and start on selling their
entities with us for example
uh they can also create paid rates
um
if they create paid rates that it works
in the same way they if they
say i can bring 1000 people to the
application i want to get back
or sorry 1000 of your tokens and then
sell it later
or they can integrate with
everything and he created custom things
together and sell further
uh so this was pretty much it
because of our application is now uh
opened and i can share activation code
with you if everyone if anyone wants it
we can
give you some places and spots invite
list
if you can earn the highest amount of
earth tokens and different perks tokens
after um
it will last for one month so within
these months um
after you start on earning those things
uh we can give you a certificate
and top three
five percent you'll get uh free loot box
that is worth of um
from five hundred two thousand dollars
and uh the rest will get very good uh
discounts on the white list for the
pre-sale of
initial nifty offering
so um
our
road map lays like this we have designed
the
mock-up landing page light paper and
information but we still need feedback
and changes in case if you have
something to say or suggest
we have website website prototype
social kick-off and ios application
lounge launching
and now our task is to integrate with
people with different bars
and currently we integrate in different
high fashion brands
to collaborate with them such as gucci
or brother to digitize their items and
introduce them in a costume manner
so
we have some commitments
from them and now negotiating the
terms and we will later announce it
further
so here is my contact details
this is my phone number you can use it
for whatsapp or
telegram this is our website and
our email in case you if you are an
investor and wants to help us with the
precedent round or you have some
feedback please
do not hesitate to message me
so yes
okay
thank you
uh so actually um
so uh what's your vision about the cross
chains about how you are planning to use
octopus bridge and your technology so is
it some somewhat useful for your
application
uh yes uh 400
because for us uh current blockchain
system like layer one or layer two of
edm compatible blockchains they sort of
separate islands
that have their small populations and we
cannot
connect to each other so this is why we
think as if we want to make the
blockchain available for everyone no
matter what blockchain they actually use
and like so uh
yes
we would further integrate uh every
single blockchain to allow
huge experience for our users and the
thing is is our model our model doesn't
require
require web3 users current of three
users to join and start on earning money
no we go through a different way
we will allow
anyone who is not familiar with
blockchain at all
to start on earning because we
want to integrate some crypto processing
uh system payments such as ramp dot io
or xola and ftg account to allow them to
purchase it from their debit or credit
cards in apple pay
okay
any more questions guys please
please
hey i wanted to ask you where the items
will be stored is there
like an in-game wallet or will you
integrate a surfboard or ever wallet
um yes uh we will integrate um
um
every scale uh no no we will not create
our custom wallet we will use uh
another wallet such as every scale
wallet or metamask
or any other worlds people use now
so the owners will have a full control
of their items
absolutely yes yes
okay
okay thank you
any other question
please
uh yes hi maybe you already told about
it but where will these people meet
like it will be a metaverse or it will
be like just an audience room like like
a group chat or and
if it is more than just an audience
a room or group or chat
how could they interact with each other
maybe couldn't can could they show the
outfit or something like that
absolutely yes uh because our events
going to be hosted in
reality and virtual reality so i live in
limassol with cyprus and we've already
initiated several events with evereef
so we have i.t
parties over here and some of them now
we use our application to create and to
join so this is actual physical place
it's like um
cafe and they join there they speak to
each other and they scan each other or
like give some talking so
like talk about their business but just
they're using uh a brave as the
application so and it can be and can
also be a metaverse like something which
is online
uh maybe in skype maybe twitch or
youtube because this is all field for us
to actually gather together and enjoy
time
okay thank you
thank you
thanks
any more questions guys please
no okay thank you for your presentation
