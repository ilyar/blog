strategy to
 

201
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,589
strategy to
to to apply that for the last minutes or

202

yeah next uh there were two more active

248
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
yeah next uh there were two more active
 

249
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,029
yeah next uh there were two more active
contests which uh oracle contest and

250
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
contests which uh oracle contest and
 

251
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:13,990
contests which uh oracle contest and
testaton

252
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
testaton
 

253
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,790
testaton
contest they there is still enough time

254
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
contest they there is still enough time
 

255
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,430
contest they there is still enough time
uh

256
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440

21 days and 46 days accordingly
so nothing to say here so there's still

260
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
so nothing to say here so there's still
 

261
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,230
so nothing to say here so there's still
a bunch of time

262
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
a bunch of time
 

263
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,749
a bunch of time
uh okay so let's move to the next topic

264
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
uh okay so let's move to the next topic
 

265
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,790
uh okay so let's move to the next topic
of today's agenda

266
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
of today's agenda
 

267
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,070
of today's agenda
uh there is actually two updates

268
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
uh there is actually two updates
 

269
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,550
uh there is actually two updates
from from our site uh from the brock's

270
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
from from our site uh from the brock's
 

271
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,550
from from our site uh from the brock's
site first of all and from freeton defy

272
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
site first of all and from freeton defy
 

273
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,670
site first of all and from freeton defy
line site

274
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
line site
 

275
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,990
line site
so the first one is about the ethereum

276
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
so the first one is about the ethereum
 

277
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,110
so the first one is about the ethereum
bridge uh

278
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
bridge uh
 

279
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,350
bridge uh
we are approaching actually the

280
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
we are approaching actually the
 

281
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,510
we are approaching actually the
implementation of a dell model

282
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
implementation of a dell model
 

283
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,270
implementation of a dell model
and uh it will use the native

284
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,280
and uh it will use the native
 

285
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,230
and uh it will use the native
bridge governance token and so it's

286
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
bridge governance token and so it's
 

287
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,189
bridge governance token and so it's
named bridge

288
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
named bridge
 

289
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,870
named bridge
for simplicity uh yeah and uh

290
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
for simplicity uh yeah and uh
 

291
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,070
for simplicity uh yeah and uh
just i will briefly explain uh how it

292
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
just i will briefly explain uh how it
 

293
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,629
just i will briefly explain uh how it
works and

294
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
works and
 

295
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,670
works and
sergey will uh dive a bit deeper into

296
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
sergey will uh dive a bit deeper into
 

297
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:05,990
sergey will uh dive a bit deeper into
the

298
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
the
 

299
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,990
the
uh economic part so actually uh

300
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
uh economic part so actually uh
 

301
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,710
uh economic part so actually uh
we analyzed uh all the popular dao

302
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
we analyzed uh all the popular dao
 

303
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,550
we analyzed uh all the popular dao
models that are currently being used in

304
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
models that are currently being used in
 

305
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:14,950
models that are currently being used in
uh

306
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
uh
 

307
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,749
uh
especially in fritz on uh sorry in

308
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
especially in fritz on uh sorry in
 

309

especially in fritz on uh sorry in
ethereum

310
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
ethereum
 

311
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,670
ethereum
network and we try

312
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
network and we try
 

313
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,790
network and we try
to take the best parts of it

314
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
to take the best parts of it
 

315
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,469
to take the best parts of it
so actually what is bridge talking uh

316
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479
so actually what is bridge talking uh
 

317
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,510
so actually what is bridge talking uh
about you will need this

318
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
about you will need this
 

319
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,990
about you will need this
of course if you want to become a relay

320
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
of course if you want to become a relay
 

321
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,029
of course if you want to become a relay
a relay

322
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
a relay
 

323
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,870
a relay
if you remember it's a special note that

324
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:38,880
if you remember it's a special note that
 

325
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,150
if you remember it's a special note that
checks and transfers the value uh

326
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
checks and transfers the value uh
 

327
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,870
checks and transfers the value uh
from one network to another so there can

328
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
from one network to another so there can
 

329
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,670
from one network to another so there can
be

330
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680

uh as for the dividends part uh

uh as for the dividends part uh
 

445
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,070
uh as for the dividends part uh
so fifty percent of it will be

446
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
so fifty percent of it will be
 

447
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,190
so fifty percent of it will be
redistributed

448
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
redistributed
 

449
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,190
redistributed
among relayers proportionally to the

450
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
among relayers proportionally to the
 

451
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,030
among relayers proportionally to the

452
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
stake and 50
 

453
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,750

will be uh distributed among all token

454
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
will be uh distributed among all token
 

455
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,389
will be uh distributed among all token
holders

456
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:26,399
holders
 

457
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,509
holders
bridge token holders uh so this is

458
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
bridge token holders uh so this is
 

459
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,829
bridge token holders uh so this is
uh a good reason to be a relay actually

460
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839
uh a good reason to be a relay actually
 

461
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,990
uh a good reason to be a relay actually
yeah and

462
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
yeah and
 

463
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,870
yeah and
that's that's where we expect a good

464
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
that's that's where we expect a good
 

465
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,670
that's that's where we expect a good
competition

466
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680
competition
 

467
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,269
competition
and also that's why we believe that

468
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
and also that's why we believe that
 

469
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,630
and also that's why we believe that
the token uh price will be organically

470
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
the token uh price will be organically
 

471
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,430
the token uh price will be organically
pushed up

472
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
pushed up
 

473
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,430
pushed up
and this is a good economic economic

474
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
and this is a good economic economic
 

475
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,430
and this is a good economic economic
tool

476
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440

 

477
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,509

so again i will i will give you the word

478
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
so again i will i will give you the word

00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
in a while uh another announcement is
 

481
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,389
in a while uh another announcement is
that

482
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:58,399
that
 

483
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,910
that
uh we are very very close to agreement

484
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:01,920
uh we are very very close to agreement
 

485
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,750
uh we are very very close to agreement
with two big protocols

486
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
with two big protocols
 

487
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,949
with two big protocols
from ethereum network uh

488
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:08,959
from ethereum network uh
 

489
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,310
from ethereum network uh
i think we will announce them quite soon

490
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
i think we will announce them quite soon
 

491
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,030
i think we will announce them quite soon
so they will appear of course in the

492
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
so they will appear of course in the
 

493
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,069
so they will appear of course in the
bridge and

494
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
bridge and
 

495
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,790
bridge and
the tokens can be easily ported through

496
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
the tokens can be easily ported through
 

497
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,790
the tokens can be easily ported through
the bridge from ethereum network

498
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
the bridge from ethereum network
 

499
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,030
the bridge from ethereum network
and also they will help us with lots of

500
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040
and also they will help us with lots of
 

501

dow as sergey said before the security
 

607
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,430
dow as sergey said before the security
audit is over and uh we already

608
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
audit is over and uh we already
 

609
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,150
audit is over and uh we already
mentioned that

610
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
mentioned that
 

611
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,550
mentioned that
there was the first uh round of security

612
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
there was the first uh round of security
 

613
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,269
there was the first uh round of security
audits that

614
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279
audits that
 

615
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,150
audits that
uh inspected our current source code and

616
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
uh inspected our current source code and
 

617
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,389
uh inspected our current source code and
you may have seen some updates coming

618
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
you may have seen some updates coming
 

619
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,710
you may have seen some updates coming
uh around the bridge when we upgraded

620
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
uh around the bridge when we upgraded
 

621
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,710
uh around the bridge when we upgraded
the bridge to the second version

622
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
the bridge to the second version
 

623
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,430
the bridge to the second version
uh so we fixed some some bugs that were

624
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
uh so we fixed some some bugs that were
 

625
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,190
uh so we fixed some some bugs that were
found by auditors

626
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,200
found by auditors
 

627
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,230
found by auditors
and uh hopefully after the second uh

628
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
and uh hopefully after the second uh
 

629
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,190
and uh hopefully after the second uh
second round we'll

630
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
second round we'll
 

631
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,670
second round we'll
take much less time because

632
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
take much less time because
 

633
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,150
take much less time because
guys already familiar with our source

634
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
guys already familiar with our source
 

635
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,310
guys already familiar with our source
code and

636
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
code and
 

637
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,550
code and
it will be easier for them to to inspect

638
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
it will be easier for them to to inspect
 

639
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,870
it will be easier for them to to inspect
it

640
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880

 

641
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,350

yeah and uh also that's why uh we

642
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360
yeah and uh also that's why uh we
 

643
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,069
yeah and uh also that's why uh we
decided

644
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
decided
 

645
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,990
decided
to combine the third and the fourth

646
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,000
to combine the third and the fourth
 

647
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,990
to combine the third and the fourth
stage of the bridge implementation into

648
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
stage of the bridge implementation into
 

649
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,389
stage of the bridge implementation into
one

650
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:40,399
one
 

651
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,949
one
so uh i think i will push to the draft

652
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
so uh i think i will push to the draft
 

653
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,310
so uh i think i will push to the draft
of the contest

654
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
of the contest
 

655
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,910
of the contest
uh either today or tomorrow uh because

656
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:47,920
uh either today or tomorrow uh because
 

657
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,269
uh either today or tomorrow uh because
we actually decided

658
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
we actually decided
 

659
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,470
we actually decided
not to uh split

660
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
not to uh split
 

661
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,990
not to uh split
it into two to two stages uh

662
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,000
it into two to two stages uh
 

663
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,150
it into two to two stages uh
of the distribution of relay

664
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
of the distribution of relay
 

665
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,910
of the distribution of relay
responsibilities and

666
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
responsibilities and
 

667
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,870
responsibilities and
uh economics and slashing and rewards

668
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:02,880
uh economics and slashing and rewards
 

669
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,870
uh economics and slashing and rewards
but rather combine it into one

670
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
but rather combine it into one
 

671
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,230
but rather combine it into one
and make the bridge operational faster

672
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
and make the bridge operational faster
 

673
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,710
and make the bridge operational faster
uh yeah i think that's pretty easy

674
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
uh yeah i think that's pretty easy
 

675
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,790
uh yeah i think that's pretty easy
about the bridge again maybe if you have

676
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:14,800
about the bridge again maybe if you have
 

677
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,030
about the bridge again maybe if you have
something else that

678
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040

 

679
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,189

get their job
and it will be possible to launch

870
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:22,480
and it will be possible to launch
 

871
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,310
and it will be possible to launch
some relay notes if you will be able to

872
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,320
some relay notes if you will be able to
 

873
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:26,950
some relay notes if you will be able to
join

874
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:26,960
join
 

875
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,990
join
uh like the pool you mean

876
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
uh like the pool you mean
 

877
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,029
uh like the pool you mean
yes that's maybe like like

878
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:33,039
yes that's maybe like like
 

879
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,950
yes that's maybe like like
like the pool we do not actually have um

880
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:36,960
like the pool we do not actually have um
 

881
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,990
like the pool we do not actually have um
the pool kind of staking when several

882
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,000
the pool kind of staking when several
 

883
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,470
the pool kind of staking when several
people can participate to fund

884
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:42,480
people can participate to fund
 

885
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,990
people can participate to fund
the relay note yet maybe we'll think

886
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,000
the relay note yet maybe we'll think
 

887
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,430
the relay note yet maybe we'll think
about this in future

888
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
about this in future
 

889
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,630
about this in future
but if you have some good relationships

890
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:50,640
but if you have some good relationships
 

891
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,909
but if you have some good relationships
with people who you trust

892
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:51,919
with people who you trust
 

893
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,630
with people who you trust
so you can just combine your tokens to

894
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:54,640
so you can just combine your tokens to
 

895
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,350
so you can just combine your tokens to
run

896
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:55,360
run
 

897
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,390
run
the software and maybe multi-sig

898
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,400
the software and maybe multi-sig
 

899
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,350
the software and maybe multi-sig
wallet like yes yes yes why not why not

900
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360
wallet like yes yes yes why not why not
 

901
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,909
wallet like yes yes yes why not why not
by the way

902
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:01,919
by the way
 

903
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,909
by the way
uh it's a good solution if you have

904
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
uh it's a good solution if you have
 

905
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,669
uh it's a good solution if you have
multi-sick wallets controlled by several

906
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:05,679
multi-sick wallets controlled by several
 

907
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:06,549
multi-sick wallets controlled by several
people

908
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:06,559
people
 

909
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,750
people
so uh you can put your tokens just in

910
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
so uh you can put your tokens just in
 

911
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:09,990
so uh you can put your tokens just in
one

912
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
one
 

913
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,830
one
place and use them to to run the relay

914
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:13,840
place and use them to to run the relay
 

915
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,590
place and use them to to run the relay
mode and this is exactly what we were

916
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:17,600
mode and this is exactly what we were
 

917
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,810
mode and this is exactly what we were
saying about

918
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:18,820
saying about
 

919
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,630
saying about
[Music]

920
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:20,640
[Music]
 

921
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,669
[Music]
i think couple of months ago there was a

922
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:23,679
i think couple of months ago there was a
 

923
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,190
i think couple of months ago there was a
lot of questions

924
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
lot of questions
 

925
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,630
lot of questions
so how people uh could become these

926
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
so how people uh could become these
 

927
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,830
so how people uh could become these
relay nodes and at that moment of time

928
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:31,840
relay nodes and at that moment of time
 

929
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,909
relay nodes and at that moment of time
uh we didn't have the clear picture

930
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
uh we didn't have the clear picture
 

931
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,270
uh we didn't have the clear picture
because we were in the

932
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
because we were in the
 

933
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,830
because we were in the
very deep market research so when trying

934
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
very deep market research so when trying
 

935
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,470
very deep market research so when trying
to

936
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:38,480
to
 

937
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,630
to
understand how the mechanics and

938
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:40,640
understand how the mechanics and
 

939
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,310
understand how the mechanics and
economics will look like

940
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,320
economics will look like
 

941
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,350
economics will look like
and now we found this solution and we

942
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:45,360
and now we found this solution and we
 

943
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,390
and now we found this solution and we
checked it with

944
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:46,400
checked it with
 

945
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,590
checked it with
some some market leaders so if they

946
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600
some some market leaders so if they
 

947
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,190
some some market leaders so if they
are interested in this and

948
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,200
are interested in this and
 

949
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,669
are interested in this and
i think this will be some novelty to the

950
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:55,679
i think this will be some novelty to the
 

951
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,950
i think this will be some novelty to the
market and that will

952
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:56,960
market and that will
 

953
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:06,149
market and that will
attract attention to the whole free tone

954
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:06,159
attract attention to the whole free tone
 

955
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,270
attract attention to the whole free tone

not sure not sure because uh there were

1112
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:10,720
not sure not sure because uh there were
 

1113
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,750
not sure not sure because uh there were
quite a number of developer contests and

1114
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:13,760
quite a number of developer contests and
 

1115
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,190
quite a number of developer contests and
uh if we remember the uh

1116
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,200
uh if we remember the uh
 

1117
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,549
uh if we remember the uh
buildings to town sdk uh i think

1118
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:20,559
buildings to town sdk uh i think
 

1119
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,750
buildings to town sdk uh i think
it was a bigger number actually

1120
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:23,760
it was a bigger number actually
 

1121
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,029
it was a bigger number actually
but they were written different

1122
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:25,039
but they were written different
 

1123
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,590
but they were written different
languages of course um

1124
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:27,600
languages of course um
 

1125
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,990
languages of course um
and maybe there were some good contests

and maybe there were some good contests
 

1127
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,669
and maybe there were some good contests

having some good website
 

1165
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,990
having some good website
where you can find all of this solution

where you can find all of this solution
 

1167
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,310
where you can find all of this solution
because right now uh

1168
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
because right now uh
 

1169
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,549
because right now uh
all of them are quite uh

1170
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:26,559

like we need to kind of participants

1370
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:29,039
like we need to kind of participants
 

1371
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,230
like we need to kind of participants
need to define

1372
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,240
need to define
 

1373
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,510
need to define
by themselves or experiment with it and

1374
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:33,520
by themselves or experiment with it and
 

1375
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,470
by themselves or experiment with it and
this this variables include for example

1376
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:36,480
this this variables include for example
 

1377
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,870
this this variables include for example
the

the
 

1379
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,389
the
the word for the oracle

1380
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:40,399
the word for the oracle
 

1381
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,870
the word for the oracle
uh the like basic reward they also the

1382
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:44,880
uh the like basic reward they also the
 

1383
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,549
uh the like basic reward they also the
feed like price feed ram

1384

00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:25,200
maybe someone can share how
 

1413
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,149
maybe someone can share how
how to evaluate them

like test
against the real price feeds uh i

1440
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:04,399
against the real price feeds uh i
 

1441
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,830
against the real price feeds uh i
just just asking for maybe you know some

1442

the coming trivial phase for example
 

1455
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,990
the coming trivial phase for example
no i i don't because it's need to be

1456
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,000
no i i don't because it's need to be
 

1457
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,430
no i i don't because it's need to be
like tested and uh

1458
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:25,440
like tested and uh
 

1459
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,870
like tested and uh
so it's up to the you know

1460
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:28,880
so it's up to the you know
 

1461
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,029
so it's up to the you know
up to the implementer okay so it's

1462
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:31,039
up to the implementer okay so it's
 

1463
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,190
up to the implementer okay so it's
inside the contest okay right

1464
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:33,200
inside the contest okay right
 

1465
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,230
inside the contest okay right
yeah like we didn't we didn't run the

1466
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,240
yeah like we didn't we didn't run the
 

1467
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,950
yeah like we didn't we didn't run the
test

1468
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:36,960
test
 

1469
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:48,830
test
simulation on that so you know

1470
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:48,840

 

1471
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,310

try

1472
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:54,320

 

1473
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,149

okay any other questions guys please

1474
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:58,159
okay any other questions guys please
 

1475
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,710
okay any other questions guys please
yeah it's also quite unclear where

1476
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:00,720
yeah it's also quite unclear where
 

1477
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,669
yeah it's also quite unclear where
should we

1478
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:01,679
should we
 

1479
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,710
should we
like get where should how how

1480
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:04,720
like get where should how how
 

1481
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,830
like get where should how how
the knots are minted because like

1482
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:07,840
the knots are minted because like
 

1483
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,389
the knots are minted because like
it's not in a paper uh i suppose or

1484
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:10,399
it's not in a paper uh i suppose or
 

1485
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:10,950
it's not in a paper uh i suppose or
maybe i

1486
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:10,960
maybe i
 

1487
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,870
maybe i
read it bad leave but like

1488
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:14,880
read it bad leave but like
 

1489
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,070
read it bad leave but like
oracle's receives reward in knots but

1490
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,080
oracle's receives reward in knots but
 

1491
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,710
oracle's receives reward in knots but
how

1492
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:18,720
how
 

1493
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,950
how
uh how kind of they

1494
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:22,960

 

1495
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,669

why not just english just a smart

1496
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:25,679
why not just english just a smart
 

1497
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,190
why not just english just a smart
contract

1498
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:27,200
contract
 

1499
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,230
contract
and uh there is a reserve

1500
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,240
and uh there is a reserve
 

1501
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,789
and uh there is a reserve
which which you trade against in the in

1502
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:32,799
which which you trade against in the in
 

1503
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,590
which which you trade against in the in
the

1504
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:33,600
the
 

1505
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,990
the
like there is an auction right or where

1506
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,000
like there is an auction right or where
 

1507
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,789
like there is an auction right or where
it means the tokens in the auction

1508
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:38,799
it means the tokens in the auction
 

1509
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,750
it means the tokens in the auction
so um somewhere there

1510
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:43,760
so um somewhere there
 

1511
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,269
so um somewhere there
is it is it an auction for what like i'm

1512
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:47,279
is it is it an auction for what like i'm
 

1513
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,269
is it is it an auction for what like i'm
i'm supplying the price fit and

1514
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:49,279
i'm supplying the price fit and
 

1515
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,070
i'm supplying the price fit and
now i need to kind of buy for that price

1516
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,080
now i need to kind of buy for that price
 

1517
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,389
now i need to kind of buy for that price
of what

1518
00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:54,399
of what
 

1519
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,630
of what
um it's in the paper fine okay

1520
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:58,640
um it's in the paper fine okay
 

1521
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,389
um it's in the paper fine okay
i need to just just thought through

1522
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:00,399
i need to just just thought through
 

1523
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,470
i need to just just thought through
because like i stopped on the auction

1524
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:02,480
because like i stopped on the auction
 

1525
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,830
because like i stopped on the auction
what auction like

1526
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:03,840
what auction like
 

1527
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,230
what auction like
i'm not trading i'm just like supply

1528
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:06,240
i'm not trading i'm just like supply
 

1529
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,430
i'm not trading i'm just like supply
there isn't there is an auction that

1530
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,440
there isn't there is an auction that
 

1531
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,230
there isn't there is an auction that
determines the

1532
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:08,240
determines the
 

1533
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,269
determines the
final price of the of the knot

1534
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:11,279
final price of the of the knot
 

1535
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,350
final price of the of the knot
of it not to turn conversion and so

1536
