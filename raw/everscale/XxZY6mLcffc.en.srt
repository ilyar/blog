if all the bridge holder is then the reason
why the bridge is growing there and why there

1139
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,130
why the bridge is growing there and why there
 

1140
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,510
why the bridge is growing there and why there
are appearing there, but we still don’t have new players  we

1141
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:02,520
are appearing there, but we still don’t have new players  we
 

1142
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,670
are appearing there, but we still don’t have new players  we
fully unpacked the entire

1143
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:04,680
fully unpacked the entire
 

1144
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,620
fully unpacked the entire
chain of the bridge, that is, if the strategies

1145
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:06,630
chain of the bridge, that is, if the strategies
 

1146
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,560
chain of the bridge, that is, if the strategies
need to work a little because of what

1147
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:09,570
need to work a little because of what
 

1148
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,300
need to work a little because of what
needs to be done, the update started, that’s the fact that

1149
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:11,310
needs to be done, the update started, that’s the fact that
 

1150
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,630
needs to be done, the update started, that’s the fact that
the same notorious type type 31 after

the same notorious type type 31 after
 

1152
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,890
the same notorious type type 31 after
it we will roll out three strategies

1153
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:15,900
it we will roll out three strategies
 

1154
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:21,970
it we will roll out three strategies
further the

1155
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:21,980

 

1156
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,940

next question is where, having given the alliance, it happens to

1157
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:25,950
next question is where, having given the alliance, it happens to
 

1158
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:32,380
next question is where, having given the alliance, it happens to
put the surpluses and

1159
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:32,390

 

1160
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,890

the question is

1161
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:35,900

 

1162
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,900

an excess of microcurrents on the market, someone is

1163
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:38,910
an excess of microcurrents on the market, someone is
 

1164
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:42,280
an excess of microcurrents on the market, someone is
buying

1165
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:42,290

 

1166
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,810

someone else now it’s a little different

1167
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:44,820
someone else now it’s a little different
 

1168
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,840
someone else now it’s a little different
it works, that is, we have

1169
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:46,850
it works, that is, we have
 

1170
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,160
it works, that is, we have
a fab fund before which there is a lot of

1171
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,170
a fab fund before which there is a lot of
 

1172
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,960
a fab fund before which there is a lot of
liquidity and, in fact, we

1173
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:50,970
liquidity and, in fact, we
 

1174
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,930
liquidity and, in fact, we
had to balance

1175
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:52,940
had to balance
 

1176
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,120
had to balance
it, that is, it is obvious that if the tokens are pouring

1177
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,130
it, that is, it is obvious that if the tokens are pouring
 

1178
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,890
it, that is, it is obvious that if the tokens are pouring
on the market, yes, that is, they go especially not

1179
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:57,900
on the market, yes, that is, they go especially not
 

1180

here on the exchanges, then there is an arbitrator

zhora and,
 

1184
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,820
zhora and,
in fact, an alliance of snow  degree the price keeps

in fact, an alliance of snow  degree the price keeps

1192
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,810

next question is what is your plan in

1193
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:20,820
next question is what is your plan in
 

1194
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,020
next question is what is your plan in
case one of the bridges of the

1195
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,030
case one of the bridges of the
 

1196

hypothetical hakuouki suddenly steals funds
 

1198
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,460
hypothetical hakuouki suddenly steals funds
look so

1199
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:27,470
look so
 

1200
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,220
look so
here it is here not just to

00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:30,230
here it is here not just to

there is sufficient verification by them,

there is sufficient verification by them,
so it’s physically impossible to withdraw everything

1209
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:40,490
so it’s physically impossible to withdraw everything
 

1210

so it’s physically impossible to withdraw everything

if some kind of

if some kind of
large transaction occurs, then we look at what kind

large transaction occurs, then we look at what kind

00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:39,970
next distribution, it might
be small, so we will do it like

respectively, we really were

00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:58,100
respectively, we really were
 

1741
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,950
respectively, we really were
taken into account the constrained update of the bridge to the

taken into account the constrained update of the bridge to the

taken into account the constrained update of the bridge to the

1744
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:02,180
new standard, now
 

1745
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,120
new standard, now
finally we will have our hands  unleashed

1746
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,130
finally we will have our hands  unleashed
 

1747
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,700
finally we will have our hands  unleashed
and the next few months, I think

1748
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:06,710
and the next few months, I think
 

1749
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,590
and the next few months, I think
that but as we see several new

that but as we see several new
 

1751
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,510
that but as we see several new
strategies to add to the bridge, which will allow

1752
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:10,520
strategies to add to the bridge, which will allow
 

1753
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,030
strategies to add to the bridge, which will allow
more efficient use of the

more efficient use of the

00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,880
second second reason - this is the limit, yes,
that is, there were no limits at night,
