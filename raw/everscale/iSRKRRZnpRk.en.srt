the first type is cross chain rooms and
 

311
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,469
the first type is cross chain rooms and
the next time is single blockchain rooms

integrate the bridge
let's go to the

566
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
let's go to the
 

567
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,710
let's go to the
game

568
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
game
 

569
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,910
game
for example if i log out we can login

570
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:35,920
for example if i log out we can login
 

571
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,509
for example if i log out we can login
one more time

572
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519

 

573
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,910

let's do it

574
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920

 

575
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,310

just a second

576
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320

 

577
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,350

by the way you can try it on game

578
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:50,360
by the way you can try it on game
 

579
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,829
by the way you can try it on game
pixely.com too

580
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:54,839

 

581
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,389

so uh later i will show you how we can

582
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
so uh later i will show you how we can
 

583
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,990
so uh later i will show you how we can
create the game

584
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
create the game
 

585
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,470
create the game
it can be a little slowly on my computer

586
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
it can be a little slowly on my computer
 

587
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,230
it can be a little slowly on my computer
because of zoom

588
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,240
because of zoom
 

589
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,430
because of zoom
but the first uh demonstration of pixel

590
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,440

so yes it's connect my valid
so we can choose blockchain i will

604
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
so we can choose blockchain i will
 

605
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,509
so we can choose blockchain i will
choose for example error scale and

606
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:33,519
choose for example error scale and
 

607
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,230
choose for example error scale and
avalanche because we plan to integrate

you can see
that i need to sign the

756
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:56,959
that i need to sign the
 

757
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:21,110
that i need to sign the
transaction just a second i will do it

758
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,120

 

759
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,150

so
 

769
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,110
so
uh we just need to wait for tokens

770
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,120
uh we just need to wait for tokens
 

771
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,230
uh we just need to wait for tokens
um

772
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
um
 

773
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,590

so
 

775
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,870
so
we create

776
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,880
we create
 

777
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,110
we create
uh so we're on the way to create the

778
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
uh so we're on the way to create the
 

779
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,630
uh so we're on the way to create the
game

780
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
game
 

781
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,190
game
we have already created something like

782
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
we have already created something like
 

783
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,230
we have already created something like
mvp of our project and by the way

784
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
mvp of our project and by the way
 

785
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,470
mvp of our project and by the way
for us this hackathon was a great

786
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:50,480
for us this hackathon was a great
 

787
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,750
for us this hackathon was a great
opportunity because we discussed about

788
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
opportunity because we discussed about
 

789
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,830
opportunity because we discussed about
integration payments and bridges a

790
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:55,840
integration payments and bridges a
 

791
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,470
integration payments and bridges a
little bit later but when i said

792
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
little bit later but when i said
 

793
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,150
little bit later but when i said
we decided

794
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
we decided
 

795
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,630
we decided
just do it and we did it we integrate

796
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
just do it and we did it we integrate
 

797
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,110
just do it and we did it we integrate
the bridge we are ready to integrate dao

798
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120
the bridge we are ready to integrate dao
 

799
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,669
the bridge we are ready to integrate dao
and other and other and uh bid mechanics

800
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:09,679
and other and other and uh bid mechanics
 

801
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,750
and other and other and uh bid mechanics
on our in our game

802
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:11,760
on our in our game
 

803
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,950
on our in our game
and i think that it can be

804
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
and i think that it can be
 

805
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,990
and i think that it can be
very interesting that you can play

806
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,000
very interesting that you can play
 

807
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,909
very interesting that you can play
with uh

808
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
with uh
 

809
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,710
with uh
some people with different blockchains

810
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720
some people with different blockchains
 

811
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,789
some people with different blockchains
in one in in one uh on one board

812
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:26,799
in one in in one uh on one board
 

813
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,430
in one in in one uh on one board
you can play it with different tokens

814
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:29,440
you can play it with different tokens
 

815
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,029
you can play it with different tokens
but using the bridge

816
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:33,039
but using the bridge
 

817
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,789

there are some

1736
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:50,839
there are some
 

1737
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:53,270
there are some
decentralized applications which are for

1738
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:53,280
decentralized applications which are for
 

1739
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,910
decentralized applications which are for
example like uh which are connected to

1740
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:55,920
example like uh which are connected to
 

1741
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,150
example like uh which are connected to
the meta verses and we can integrate our

1742
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:58,160
the meta verses and we can integrate our
 

1743
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,230
the meta verses and we can integrate our
application to the games for example the

1744
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:00,240
application to the games for example the
 

1745
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,870
application to the games for example the
game of the first team maybe

1746
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:02,880
game of the first team maybe
 

1747
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,430
game of the first team maybe
because right now the situation is uh

1748
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:05,440
because right now the situation is uh
 

1749
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,750
because right now the situation is uh
for example in our country we have got

1750
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:07,760
for example in our country we have got
 

1751
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,069
for example in our country we have got
an application uh which is called caspi

1752
00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:10,079
an application uh which is called caspi
 

1753
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,430
an application uh which is called caspi
dot uh he said which uh

1754
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:13,440
dot uh he said which uh
 

1755
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,870
dot uh he said which uh
like holds all the uh money uh

1756
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:16,880
like holds all the uh money uh
 

1757
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,630
like holds all the uh money uh
which all the

1758
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:18,640
which all the
 

1759
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,390
which all the
citizens of the kazakhstan use it for

1760
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:20,400
citizens of the kazakhstan use it for
 

1761
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,990
citizens of the kazakhstan use it for
example uh we right now we are uh how to

1762
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:24,000
example uh we right now we are uh how to
 

1763
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,589
example uh we right now we are uh how to
say cancelling the

1764
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:25,599
say cancelling the
 

1765
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,950
say cancelling the
uh cash money and uh going to the step

1766
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:28,960
uh cash money and uh going to the step
 

1767
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,750
uh cash money and uh going to the step
of the uh holding money online which is

1768
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:31,760
of the uh holding money online which is
 

1769
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,670
of the uh holding money online which is
uh web2no but uh no one are no one is

1770
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:35,680
uh web2no but uh no one are no one is
 

1771
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,270
uh web2no but uh no one are no one is
holding a cryptocurrency in their

1772
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:37,280
holding a cryptocurrency in their
 

1773
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,069
holding a cryptocurrency in their
wallets and uh for example before kaspic

1774
00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:40,079
wallets and uh for example before kaspic
 

1775
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,069
wallets and uh for example before kaspic
is that will integrate uh these

1776
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:42,079
is that will integrate uh these
 

1777
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,150
is that will integrate uh these
technologies there might be

1778
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:44,160
technologies there might be
 

1779
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,069
technologies there might be
like many years and if for example the

1780
00:48:48,069 --> 00:48:48,079
like many years and if for example the
 

1781
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,069
like many years and if for example the
platforms or technologies like everscale

1782
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:50,079
platforms or technologies like everscale
 

1783
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,549
platforms or technologies like everscale
will integrate to our country to the

1784
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:52,559
will integrate to our country to the
 

1785
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,349
will integrate to our country to the
countries of central asia with

1786
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:55,359
countries of central asia with
 

1787
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:59,190
countries of central asia with
its destructionalized networks i guess

1788
00:48:59,190 --> 00:48:59,200
its destructionalized networks i guess
 

1789

we also
 

2029
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,750
we also
the main idea was that we could choose

01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,270
the main idea was that we could choose
the wallet

01:03:59,270 --> 01:03:59,280
the wallet
 

2033
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,029
the wallet
so it would be the

2034
01:04:01,029 --> 01:04:01,039
so it would be the
 

2035
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:02,710
so it would be the
cross chain

2036
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:02,720
cross chain
 

2037
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,029

01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,190
we now have every scale and we could
could add metamask i'm not sure if

2042
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:13,200
could add metamask i'm not sure if
 

2043
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,910
could add metamask i'm not sure if
they are added it already but the main

2044
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:15,920
they are added it already but the main
 

2045
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,870
they are added it already but the main
idea was that we could do that

2046
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:18,880
idea was that we could do that
 

2047
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,410
idea was that we could do that
um could add any wallet and

2048
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:21,420
um could add any wallet and

it looks in our app so we choose rock

2054
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:29,680
it looks in our app so we choose rock
 

2055
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,990
it looks in our app so we choose rock
paper scissors we

2056
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:32,000
paper scissors we
 

2057
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,789
paper scissors we
set amount of

2058
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:34,799
set amount of
 

2059
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:37,349
set amount of
coins and we also

2060
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:37,359
coins and we also
 

2061
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:38,230
coins and we also
um

2062
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:38,240
um
 

2063
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,150
um
it might uh

2064
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:40,160
it might uh
 

2065
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,710
it might uh
be another realization of random number

2066
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:42,720
be another realization of random number
 

2067
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,589
be another realization of random number
so uh why we need random number that's

2068
01:04:45,589 --> 01:04:45,599
so uh why we need random number that's
 

2069
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,029
so uh why we need random number that's
because

because
 

2071
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:49,190
because
uh when alice makes a bet

2072
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:49,200
uh when alice makes a bet
 

2073
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,470
uh when alice makes a bet
she

01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,910
sends
her hash with her choice and random

2078
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:55,920
her hash with her choice and random
 

2079
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,670
her hash with her choice and random
number and

2080
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:57,680
number and
 

2081
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,549
number and
it

2082
01:04:58,549 --> 01:04:58,559
it
 

2083
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,950
it
generates a hash

2084
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:00,960
generates a hash
 

2085
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,630
generates a hash
so um

2086
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:02,640
so um
 

2087
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:06,150
so um
she sent the hash and bob when he wants

2088
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:06,160
she sent the hash and bob when he wants
 

2089
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,190
she sent the hash and bob when he wants
also to make a bet he see the hash and

2090
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:09,200
also to make a bet he see the hash and
 

2091
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:09,910
also to make a bet he see the hash and
he

2092
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:09,920
he
 

2093
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,069
he
will be sure that it wouldn't would not

2094
01:05:12,069 --> 01:05:12,079
will be sure that it wouldn't would not
 

2095
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:13,430
will be sure that it wouldn't would not
change

2096
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:13,440
change
 

2097
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,710
change
so

2098
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:14,720
so
 

2099
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,789
so
when he uh makes

2100
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:16,799
when he uh makes
 

2101
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,029
when he uh makes
another bite um

2102
01:05:19,029 --> 01:05:19,039
another bite um
 

2103
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:20,230
another bite um
the

2104
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:20,240
the
 

2105
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,589
the
the shoes that alice made and the

2106
01:05:23,589 --> 01:05:23,599
the shoes that alice made and the
 

2107
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:25,670
the shoes that alice made and the
original number um

2108
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:25,680
original number um
 

2109
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,349
original number um
she she has only um only she has that

2110
01:05:29,349 --> 01:05:29,359
she she has only um only she has that
 

2111
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,029
she she has only um only she has that
secret

2112
01:05:31,029 --> 01:05:31,039
secret
 

2113
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:31,910
secret
and

2114
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:31,920
and
 

2115
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,190
and
when bob makes another bet

2116
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:35,200
when bob makes another bet
 

2117
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,349
when bob makes another bet
um he

2118
01:05:37,349 --> 01:05:37,359
um he
 

2119
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:40,230
um he
will see that um yes exactly that's the

2120
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:40,240
will see that um yes exactly that's the
 

2121
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:45,270
will see that um yes exactly that's the
same hash and she couldn't like

2122
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:45,280

 

2123
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,349

is there either way she could see that

2124
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:47,359
is there either way she could see that
 

2125
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:48,950
is there either way she could see that
he um

2126
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:48,960
he um
 

2127
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,230
he um
he would like paper and

2128
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:52,240
he would like paper and
 

2129
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,150
he would like paper and
she had um

2130
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:54,160
she had um
 

2131
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,589
she had um
rock and she couldn't change it later so

2132
01:05:57,589 --> 01:05:57,599
rock and she couldn't change it later so
 

2133
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:59,589
rock and she couldn't change it later so
it would be fair

2134
01:05:59,589 --> 01:05:59,599
it would be fair
 

2135
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:01,190
it would be fair
for a game

2136
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:01,200
for a game
 

2137
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,390
for a game
and yeah so after we click make a bet we

2138
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:04,400
and yeah so after we click make a bet we
 

2139
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,630
and yeah so after we click make a bet we
create a hash

2140
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:06,640
create a hash
 

2141
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,670
create a hash
under hood and

2142
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:09,680

 

2143
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:14,069

then the new bed will appear on the list

2144
01:06:14,069 --> 01:06:14,079

 

2145
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,510

that's how

2146
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:15,520
that's how
 

2147
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,750
that's how
it looks now if someone click on the bed

2148
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:17,760
it looks now if someone click on the bed
 

2149
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,870
it looks now if someone click on the bed
and he will choose rock paper scissors

2150
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:20,880
and he will choose rock paper scissors
 

2151
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,950
and he will choose rock paper scissors
like um

2152
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:22,960
like um
 

2153
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,630
like um
and

2154
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:24,640
and
 

2155
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,829
and
he

2156
01:06:25,829 --> 01:06:25,839
he
 

2157
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:29,990
he
beat it so if

2158
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:30,000

 

2159
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,430

bet was

2160
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:31,440
bet was
 

2161
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,549
bet was
answered so if someone make another bed

2162
01:06:34,549 --> 01:06:34,559
answered so if someone make another bed
 

2163
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:37,270
answered so if someone make another bed
it would appear like uh and green

2164
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:37,280
it would appear like uh and green
 

2165
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,549
it would appear like uh and green
and if

2166
01:06:38,549 --> 01:06:38,559
and if
 

2167
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:39,349
and if
it's

2168
01:06:39,349 --> 01:06:39,359
it's
 

2169
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:41,990
it's
the bed hasn't uh been uh

2170
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:42,000
the bed hasn't uh been uh
 

2171

2221
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:44,870
don't have right now it's a vault well
where

2222
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:44,880
where
 

2223
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,910
where
we ideally wanted to store uh the secret

01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,470
uh now we started in local storage but i
know it's not an

01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:54,480
know it's not an
 

2231
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,390
know it's not an
ideal scenario

2232
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:56,400
ideal scenario
 

2233
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,470
ideal scenario
are we working on it

2234
01:07:58,470 --> 01:07:58,480
are we working on it
 

2235
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,370

01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,070
um
so that's

2250
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,080
so that's

2318
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:41,920
uh so um same question as to the
 

2319
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,950
uh so um same question as to the
previous team so uh what's uh the value

2320
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:44,960
previous team so uh what's uh the value
 

2321
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,550
previous team so uh what's uh the value
of the cross chain in your application

2322
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:46,560
of the cross chain in your application
 

2323
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,709
of the cross chain in your application
so how do you plan to use it

2324
01:09:48,709 --> 01:09:48,719
so how do you plan to use it
 

2325
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:51,910
so how do you plan to use it
and how your application will evolve to

2326
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:51,920
and how your application will evolve to
 

2327
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,910
and how your application will evolve to
give more access to

2328
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:53,920
give more access to
 

2329
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,470
give more access to
your users from other networks yeah

2330
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:56,480
your users from other networks yeah
 

2331
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,430
your users from other networks yeah
so

2332
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:57,440
so
 

2333
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,830
so
the idea was that we could

2334
01:09:59,830 --> 01:09:59,840
the idea was that we could
 

2335
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,910
the idea was that we could
if we don't have ever skill wallet or

2336
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:01,920
if we don't have ever skill wallet or
 

2337
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,990
if we don't have ever skill wallet or
have any other wallet we can use it to

2338
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:04,000
have any other wallet we can use it to
 

2339
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,950
have any other wallet we can use it to
make a bet or to beat someone's bed

2340
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:06,960
make a bet or to beat someone's bed
 

2341
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,709
make a bet or to beat someone's bed
so um

2342
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:08,719
so um
 

2343
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:11,990
so um
yeah that's was the idea

2344
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:12,000
yeah that's was the idea
 

2345
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,070
yeah that's was the idea
and what does

2346
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:14,080
and what does
 

2347
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,310

such
strategies

2652
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:15,120
strategies
 

2653
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:18,149
strategies
so for example if you are not a noob

2654
01:32:18,149 --> 01:32:18,159
so for example if you are not a noob
 

2655
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:21,350
so for example if you are not a noob
you are using defy on

2656
01:32:21,350 --> 01:32:21,360
you are using defy on
 

2657
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,669
you are using defy on
chains uh with

2658
01:32:23,669 --> 01:32:23,679
chains uh with
 

2659
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:26,470
chains uh with
some strategy like for example you can

2660
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:26,480
some strategy like for example you can
 

2661
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:29,189
some strategy like for example you can
start with a lending protocol you can

2662
01:32:29,189 --> 01:32:29,199
start with a lending protocol you can
 

2663
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:31,510
start with a lending protocol you can
start with the native assets of the

2664
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:31,520
start with the native assets of the
 

2665
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,070
start with the native assets of the
chain and then you can borrow some money

2666
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:34,080
chain and then you can borrow some money
 

2667
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:37,270
chain and then you can borrow some money
to use it on d5 then you will have the

2668
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:37,280
to use it on d5 then you will have the
 

2669
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:38,950
to use it on d5 then you will have the
strategy with

2670
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:38,960
strategy with
 

2671
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:41,030
strategy with
two products so first product this is

2672
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:41,040
two products so first product this is
 

2673
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,189
two products so first product this is
landing protocol and second for example

2674
01:32:43,189 --> 01:32:43,199
landing protocol and second for example
 

2675
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:44,229
landing protocol and second for example
farming

2676
01:32:44,229 --> 01:32:44,239
farming
 

2677
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:45,350
farming
and

2678
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:45,360
and
 

2679
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,510
and
now you already need something to

2680
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:47,520
now you already need something to
 

2681
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,709
now you already need something to
control it to maintain it so

2682
01:32:50,709 --> 01:32:50,719
control it to maintain it so
 

2683
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:53,110
control it to maintain it so
i if you also have a lot of strategies

2684
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:53,120
i if you also have a lot of strategies
 

2685
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,270
i if you also have a lot of strategies
on different chains you need

2686
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:55,280
on different chains you need
 

2687
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:57,990
on different chains you need
such a tool who will be

2688
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:58,000
such a tool who will be
 

2689
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,870
such a tool who will be
he'll allow you to control the situation

2690
01:33:00,870 --> 01:33:00,880
he'll allow you to control the situation
 

2691
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:03,189
he'll allow you to control the situation
inside for example you need to

2692
01:33:03,189 --> 01:33:03,199
inside for example you need to
 

2693
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:05,350
inside for example you need to
maintain your position in the landing

2694
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:05,360
maintain your position in the landing
 

2695
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,350
maintain your position in the landing
particle for example you need to change

2696
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:07,360
particle for example you need to change
 

2697
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:10,149
particle for example you need to change
the pools in farming because you see

2698
01:33:10,149 --> 01:33:10,159
the pools in farming because you see
 

2699
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:14,550
the pools in farming because you see
a greater api on different farm farming

2700
01:33:14,550 --> 01:33:14,560
a greater api on different farm farming

non-custodial how it can be
 

2839
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,070
non-custodial how it can be
non-custodial what about the changes in

2840
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:54,080
non-custodial what about the changes in
 

2841
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:56,310
non-custodial what about the changes in
strategies for example we will have some

2842
01:35:56,310 --> 01:35:56,320
strategies for example we will have some
 

2843
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,229
strategies for example we will have some
changes inside the positions of the

2844
01:35:58,229 --> 01:35:58,239
changes inside the positions of the
 

2845
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:00,870
changes inside the positions of the
lending protocols and what about the

2846
01:36:00,870 --> 01:36:00,880
lending protocols and what about the
 

2847
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,470
lending protocols and what about the
updates so

2848
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:02,480
updates so
 

2849
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,550
updates so
we need to maintain a lot of stuff

2850
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:04,560
we need to maintain a lot of stuff
 

2851
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:07,189
we need to maintain a lot of stuff
inside a lot of widgets of

2852
01:36:07,189 --> 01:36:07,199
inside a lot of widgets of
 

2853
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:08,229
inside a lot of widgets of
projects

2854
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:08,239
projects
 

2855
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:09,669
projects
and yes

2856
01:36:09,669 --> 01:36:09,679
and yes
 

2857
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:11,830
and yes
you're right but

2858
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:11,840
you're right but
 

2859
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,830
you're right but
this is really non-custodial service

2860
01:36:13,830 --> 01:36:13,840
this is really non-custodial service
 

2861
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,470
this is really non-custodial service
because we will have active auto

2862
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:16,480
because we will have active auto

01:36:33,189 --> 01:36:33,199
create the bots so they can
 

2875
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:35,590
create the bots so they can
just trigger the component

they receive some trigger fees

2888
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:48,880
they receive some trigger fees
 

2889
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,550
they receive some trigger fees
also we have the governments for all

2890
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:50,560
also we have the governments for all
 

2891
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:53,350
also we have the governments for all

beholders
 

2893
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:56,390
beholders
for example if the strategy

2894
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:56,400
for example if the strategy
 

2895
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:59,189
for example if the strategy
uh need to change something

2896
01:36:59,189 --> 01:36:59,199
uh need to change something
 

2897
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:01,430
uh need to change something
in landing protocol position so we will

2898
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:01,440
in landing protocol position so we will
 

2899
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,350
in landing protocol position so we will
have a status julenium protocol and then

2900
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:03,360
have a status julenium protocol and then
 

2901
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,510
have a status julenium protocol and then
alternative the farmer

2902
01:37:05,510 --> 01:37:05,520
alternative the farmer
 

2903
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,270
alternative the farmer
if you're using this strategy you

2904
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:07,280
if you're using this strategy you
 

2905
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:11,109
if you're using this strategy you
receive the lps so

2906
01:37:11,109 --> 01:37:11,119

 

2907
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:13,910

and you'll be able to propose

2908
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:13,920
and you'll be able to propose
 

2909
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,229
and you'll be able to propose
some voting in the governments to change

2910
01:37:16,229 --> 01:37:16,239
some voting in the governments to change
 

2911
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:17,830
some voting in the governments to change
for example the borrow limit inside

2912
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:17,840
for example the borrow limit inside
 

2913
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:20,709
for example the borrow limit inside
lenin protocol and

2914
01:37:20,709 --> 01:37:20,719
lenin protocol and
 

2915
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:23,510
lenin protocol and
if the lp holders decide to change it

2916
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:23,520
if the lp holders decide to change it
 

2917
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,750
if the lp holders decide to change it
contract will change and what about the

2918
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:25,760
contract will change and what about the
 

2919
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,229
contract will change and what about the
projects update so

2920
01:37:28,229 --> 01:37:28,239
projects update so
 

2921
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:30,629
projects update so
we will have the update process

2922
01:37:30,629 --> 01:37:30,639
we will have the update process
 

2923
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:31,590
we will have the update process
when

2924
01:37:31,590 --> 01:37:31,600
when
 

2925
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:35,910
when
integrated projects inside this protocol

2926
01:37:35,910 --> 01:37:35,920
integrated projects inside this protocol
 

2927
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,189
integrated projects inside this protocol
will have

2928
01:37:37,189 --> 01:37:37,199
will have
 

2929
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:39,030
will have
ability to

01:37:39,030 --> 01:37:39,040
ability to
 

2931
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:41,669
ability to
just send us the pull requests we will

2932
01:37:41,669 --> 01:37:41,679
just send us the pull requests we will
 

2933
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:44,390

on our desk
then we can set it

3000
01:38:56,950 --> 01:38:56,960
then we can set it
 

3001
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,430
then we can set it
we put the we push the button of this

3002

we can choose like 25 15 percent okay so

3010
01:39:08,149 --> 01:39:08,159
we can choose like 25 15 percent okay so
 

3011
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:10,229
we can choose like 25 15 percent okay so
we choose max

we choose max
 

3013
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:12,709
we choose max
then we are able to

3014
01:39:12,709 --> 01:39:12,719
then we are able to
 

3015
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:16,629
then we are able to
choose

3016
01:39:16,629 --> 01:39:16,639

we are able to choose any other product
 

3019
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:20,070
we are able to choose any other product
so for example we will choose the

3020
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:20,080
so for example we will choose the
 

3021
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:23,030
so for example we will choose the
landing we will have the landing also on

3022
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:23,040
landing we will have the landing also on
 

3023
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,750
landing we will have the landing also on
our decks and we can draw this line from

3024
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:25,760
our decks and we can draw this line from
 

3025
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:28,550
our decks and we can draw this line from
the wallet to the landing after it will

3026
01:39:28,550 --> 01:39:28,560
the wallet to the landing after it will
 

3027
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,910
the wallet to the landing after it will
set the language so we can

3028
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:31,920
set the language so we can
 

3029
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:33,830
set the language so we can
land wherever because we choose whether

3030
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:33,840
land wherever because we choose whether
 

3031
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,590
land wherever because we choose whether
from the wallet and we can borrow dye

3032
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:35,600
from the wallet and we can borrow dye
 

3033
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,910
from the wallet and we can borrow dye
for example also we choose

3034
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:37,920
for example also we choose
 

3035
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,310
for example also we choose
borrow limit

3036
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:40,320
borrow limit
 

3037
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,750
borrow limit
okay

3038
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:41,760
okay
 

3039
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,990
okay
uh then we are

3040
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:44,000
uh then we are
 

3041
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,709
uh then we are
want to participate with the farming in

the strategy so we can take the farming

3044
01:39:49,669 --> 01:39:49,679
the strategy so we can take the farming
 

3045
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:50,629
the strategy so we can take the farming
from this

3046
01:39:50,629 --> 01:39:50,639

then we can set it
for example we have the farming pools

3052
01:39:57,270 --> 01:39:57,280
for example we have the farming pools
 

3053
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,750
for example we have the farming pools
like dire weather weather cube usdc

01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:53,760
uh as i mentioned before we started with
 

3239
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:54,870
uh as i mentioned before we started with
the

3240
01:43:54,870 --> 01:43:54,880
the
 

3241
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,870
the
uh part of the information for this

3242
01:43:56,870 --> 01:43:56,880
uh part of the information for this
 

3243
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,870
uh part of the information for this
farming strategy then we have the

3244
01:43:58,870 --> 01:43:58,880
farming strategy then we have the
 

3245
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:01,910
farming strategy then we have the
strategy update proposal for example

3246
01:44:01,910 --> 01:44:01,920
strategy update proposal for example
 

3247
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:04,950
strategy update proposal for example
uh we will have the updates

3248
01:44:04,950 --> 01:44:04,960
uh we will have the updates
 

3249
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:07,109
uh we will have the updates
like

3250
01:44:07,109 --> 01:44:07,119
like
 

3251
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:10,149
like
behind the market situation

3252
01:44:10,149 --> 01:44:10,159
behind the market situation
 

3253
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:11,750
behind the market situation
we can

3254
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:11,760
we can
 

3255
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:14,310
we can
for example maintain this strategy in

3256
01:44:14,310 --> 01:44:14,320
for example maintain this strategy in
 

3257
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,550
for example maintain this strategy in
one case if you are using the lending

3258
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:16,560
one case if you are using the lending
 

3259
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:19,189
one case if you are using the lending
protocol in this strategy we can change

3260
01:44:19,189 --> 01:44:19,199
protocol in this strategy we can change
 

3261
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:20,950
protocol in this strategy we can change
the portal limit so for example you

3262
01:44:20,950 --> 01:44:20,960
the portal limit so for example you
 

3263
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,510
the portal limit so for example you
start with 60 percentage and we would

3264
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:23,520
start with 60 percentage and we would
 

3265
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:26,070
start with 60 percentage and we would
like to change it to 20 because of the

3266
01:44:26,070 --> 01:44:26,080
like to change it to 20 because of the
 

3267
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:29,270
like to change it to 20 because of the
risks and you're like a participant of

3268
01:44:29,270 --> 01:44:29,280
risks and you're like a participant of
 

3269
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:33,030
risks and you're like a participant of
this strategy able to propose an update

3270
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:33,040
this strategy able to propose an update
 

3271
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:35,270
this strategy able to propose an update
for the strategy

3272
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:35,280

and here we have the triggers and

3352
01:46:12,550 --> 01:46:12,560
and here we have the triggers and
 

3353
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:14,629
and here we have the triggers and
these triggers help us to be

3354
01:46:14,629 --> 01:46:14,639
these triggers help us to be
 

3355
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:16,950
these triggers help us to be
non-custodial so

3356
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:16,960
non-custodial so
 

3357
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,470
non-custodial so
we are

3358
01:46:18,470 --> 01:46:18,480
we are
 

3359
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:20,950
we are
creating different contract for

3360
01:46:20,950 --> 01:46:20,960
creating different contract for
 

3361
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,590
creating different contract for
different strategies we have like a

3362
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:23,600
different strategies we have like a
 

3363
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:26,149
different strategies we have like a
contract factory inside this product and

3364
01:46:26,149 --> 01:46:26,159
contract factory inside this product and
 

3365
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:27,990
contract factory inside this product and
when you set your strategy we will

3366
01:46:27,990 --> 01:46:28,000
when you set your strategy we will
 

3367
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,910
when you set your strategy we will
create

3368
01:46:29,910 --> 01:46:29,920
create
 

3369
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:30,870
create
the

3370
01:46:30,870 --> 01:46:30,880
the
 

3371
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:33,830
the
different contract for you and everyone

3372
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:33,840
different contract for you and everyone
 

3373
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,669
different contract for you and everyone
can trigger that contract for the

3374
01:46:35,669 --> 01:46:35,679
can trigger that contract for the
 

3375
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:36,950
can trigger that contract for the
trigger fee

3376
01:46:36,950 --> 01:46:36,960
trigger fee
 

3377
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:37,990
trigger fee
and

3378
01:46:37,990 --> 01:46:38,000
and
 

3379
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,870
and
that's how it works so for example uh we

3380
01:46:40,870 --> 01:46:40,880
that's how it works so for example uh we
 

3381
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:41,910
that's how it works so for example uh we
will

3382
01:46:41,910 --> 01:46:41,920
will
 

3383
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:45,189
will
be able to earn a little bit more money

3384
01:46:45,189 --> 01:46:45,199
be able to earn a little bit more money
 

3385
01:46:45,199 --> 01:46:47,669
be able to earn a little bit more money

the project monetization models firstly
 

3409
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:17,109
the project monetization models firstly
the performance fee as i said from the

3410
01:47:17,109 --> 01:47:17,119
the performance fee as i said from the
 

3411
01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:19,510
the performance fee as i said from the
strategies but for the whole projects we

strategies but for the whole projects we
 

3413
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:21,950
strategies but for the whole projects we
will take like uh

3414

economics and then we have another pitch
for the phones to the second round for

3614
01:51:12,550 --> 01:51:12,560
for the phones to the second round for
 

3615
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:15,589
for the phones to the second round for
five millions and uh finally developed

3616
01:51:15,589 --> 01:51:15,599
five millions and uh finally developed
 

3617
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:17,350
five millions and uh finally developed
in product piece

3618
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:17,360
in product piece
 

3619
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:20,709
in product piece
and why way i choose everscale so define

3620
01:51:20,709 --> 01:51:20,719
and why way i choose everscale so define
 

3621
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:22,870
and why way i choose everscale so define
every scale there is an initial stage

3622
01:51:22,870 --> 01:51:22,880
every scale there is an initial stage
 

3623
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:25,990
every scale there is an initial stage
and we have lower gas fees but the first

3624
01:51:25,990 --> 01:51:26,000
and we have lower gas fees but the first
 

3625
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,709
and we have lower gas fees but the first
one is a major different initial stage

3626
01:51:28,709 --> 01:51:28,719
one is a major different initial stage
 

3627
01:51:28,719 --> 01:51:29,750
one is a major different initial stage
because

3628
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:29,760
because
 

3629
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,589
because
we just have

3630
01:51:31,589 --> 01:51:31,599
we just have
 

3631
01:51:31,599 --> 01:51:33,669
we just have
a few products which we can simply

3632
01:51:33,669 --> 01:51:33,679
a few products which we can simply
 

3633
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:35,270
a few products which we can simply
integrate and

3634
01:51:35,270 --> 01:51:35,280
integrate and
 

3635
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,589
integrate and
then continue our growth with these

3636
01:51:37,589 --> 01:51:37,599
then continue our growth with these
 

3637
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:39,270
then continue our growth with these
products and

3638
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:39,280
products and
 

3639
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:42,229
products and
it will help us easily integrate any

3640
01:51:42,229 --> 01:51:42,239
it will help us easily integrate any
 

3641
01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:45,030
it will help us easily integrate any
older products after it

3642
01:51:45,030 --> 01:51:45,040
older products after it
 

3643
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:45,830
older products after it
and

3644
01:51:45,830 --> 01:51:45,840
and
 

3645
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:49,270
and
what did we miss in the prototype so

3646
01:51:49,270 --> 01:51:49,280
what did we miss in the prototype so
 

3647
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:50,390
what did we miss in the prototype so
we worked

3648
01:51:50,390 --> 01:51:50,400
we worked
 

3649
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:52,470
we worked
a lot with my friend we spent all night

3650
01:51:52,470 --> 01:51:52,480
a lot with my friend we spent all night
 

3651
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:54,390
a lot with my friend we spent all night
but we missed some features the one

3652
01:51:54,390 --> 01:51:54,400
but we missed some features the one
 

3653
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,070
but we missed some features the one
feature we missed is the setting the

3654
01:51:56,070 --> 01:51:56,080
feature we missed is the setting the
 

3655
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:58,229
feature we missed is the setting the
coffee sense to maintain strategy for

3656
01:51:58,229 --> 01:51:58,239
coffee sense to maintain strategy for
 

3657
01:51:58,239 --> 01:51:59,510
coffee sense to maintain strategy for
example

3658
01:51:59,510 --> 01:51:59,520
example
 

3659
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:01,750
example
in the voting process you will be able

3660
01:52:01,750 --> 01:52:01,760
in the voting process you will be able
 

3661
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:02,470
in the voting process you will be able
to

3662
01:52:02,470 --> 01:52:02,480
to
 

3663
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:04,790
to
vote in some

3664
01:52:04,790 --> 01:52:04,800
vote in some
 

3665
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:07,910
vote in some
coefficients and before it in the

3666
01:52:07,910 --> 01:52:07,920
coefficients and before it in the
 

3667
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,149
coefficients and before it in the
strategy you should set it so for

3668
01:52:10,149 --> 01:52:10,159
strategy you should set it so for
 

3669
01:52:10,159 --> 01:52:13,510
strategy you should set it so for
example the voting can be

3670
01:52:13,510 --> 01:52:13,520
example the voting can be
 

3671
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:15,750
example the voting can be
in changing pools in some farming

3672
01:52:15,750 --> 01:52:15,760
in changing pools in some farming
 

3673
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:18,790
in changing pools in some farming
strategy or in changing oral limit in

3674
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:18,800
strategy or in changing oral limit in
 

3675
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:21,430
strategy or in changing oral limit in
the landing particle also we are lose

3676
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:21,440
the landing particle also we are lose
 

3677
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:23,350
the landing particle also we are lose
the entire process of devoting and

3678
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:23,360
the entire process of devoting and
 

3679
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:25,510
the entire process of devoting and
accepting changes because

3680
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:25,520
accepting changes because
 

3681
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:28,709
accepting changes because
we create this user flow

3682
01:52:28,709 --> 01:52:28,719
we create this user flow
 

3683
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:32,070
we create this user flow
we will have like 15 screens in it

3684
01:52:32,070 --> 01:52:32,080
we will have like 15 screens in it
 

3685
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:33,669
we will have like 15 screens in it
also you lose the private strategy

3686
01:52:33,669 --> 01:52:33,679
also you lose the private strategy
 

3687
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:36,950
also you lose the private strategy
because uh someone's don't want to see

3688
01:52:36,950 --> 01:52:36,960
because uh someone's don't want to see
 

3689
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:39,189
because uh someone's don't want to see
they don't want to share

3690
01:52:39,189 --> 01:52:39,199
they don't want to share
 

3691
01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:40,149
they don't want to share
your

3692
01:52:40,149 --> 01:52:40,159
your
 

3693
01:52:40,159 --> 01:52:42,629
your
own strategy and uh

3694
01:52:42,629 --> 01:52:42,639
own strategy and uh
 

3695
01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:45,189
own strategy and uh
it's a really powerful feature because

3696
01:52:45,189 --> 01:52:45,199
it's a really powerful feature because
 

3697
01:52:45,199 --> 01:52:47,350
it's a really powerful feature because
uh i just saw the opportunities i want

3698
01:52:47,350 --> 01:52:47,360
uh i just saw the opportunities i want
 

3699
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:49,830
uh i just saw the opportunities i want
to create the strategy and

3700
01:52:49,830 --> 01:52:49,840
to create the strategy and
 

3701
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:53,430
to create the strategy and
even we are miss the strategy clubs or

3702
01:52:53,430 --> 01:52:53,440
even we are miss the strategy clubs or
 

3703
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,669
even we are miss the strategy clubs or
the strategy groups for example they can

3704
01:52:55,669 --> 01:52:55,679
the strategy groups for example they can
 

3705
01:52:55,679 --> 01:52:57,830
the strategy groups for example they can
come together with five or ten people's

3706
01:52:57,830 --> 01:52:57,840
come together with five or ten people's
 

3707
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:59,510
come together with five or ten people's
chest shoulder strategy and that's it

3708
01:52:59,510 --> 01:52:59,520
chest shoulder strategy and that's it
 

3709
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:02,470
chest shoulder strategy and that's it
with any other kids also that means the

3710
01:53:02,470 --> 01:53:02,480
with any other kids also that means the
 

3711
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:05,589
with any other kids also that means the
assets analytics so within our strategy

3712
01:53:05,589 --> 01:53:05,599
assets analytics so within our strategy
 

3713
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:08,390
assets analytics so within our strategy
in deep i mean we'll have a lot of

3714
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:08,400
in deep i mean we'll have a lot of
 

3715
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,629
in deep i mean we'll have a lot of
assets inside the strategy and we should

3716
01:53:10,629 --> 01:53:10,639
assets inside the strategy and we should
 

3717
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:12,550
assets inside the strategy and we should
have the analytics behind it so for

3718
01:53:12,550 --> 01:53:12,560
have the analytics behind it so for
 

3719
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:14,629
have the analytics behind it so for
example in the whole strategy i would

3720
01:53:14,629 --> 01:53:14,639
example in the whole strategy i would
 

3721
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:15,910
example in the whole strategy i would
love to see

3722
01:53:15,910 --> 01:53:15,920
love to see
 

3723
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:18,229
love to see
uh the risk parameters for the lending

3724
01:53:18,229 --> 01:53:18,239
uh the risk parameters for the lending
 

3725
01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:20,870
uh the risk parameters for the lending
protocols like how much money we already

3726
01:53:20,870 --> 01:53:20,880
protocols like how much money we already
 

3727
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:22,790
protocols like how much money we already
borrowed how much money we are landed

3728
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:22,800
borrowed how much money we are landed
 

3729
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,950
borrowed how much money we are landed
what's uh the collateral factor what's

3730
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:24,960
what's uh the collateral factor what's
 

3731
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:28,470
what's uh the collateral factor what's
the borrow limit just to understand is

3732
01:53:28,470 --> 01:53:28,480
the borrow limit just to understand is
 

3733
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:30,550
the borrow limit just to understand is
it safe to invest or not

3734
01:53:30,550 --> 01:53:30,560
it safe to invest or not
 

3735
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:33,109
it safe to invest or not
also build the strategy approval process

3736
01:53:33,109 --> 01:53:33,119
also build the strategy approval process
 

3737
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:35,830
also build the strategy approval process
uh we have some ideas how we can improve

3738
01:53:35,830 --> 01:53:35,840
uh we have some ideas how we can improve
 

3739
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:39,030
uh we have some ideas how we can improve
how how we can uh maintain this process

3740
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:39,040
how how we can uh maintain this process
 

3741
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:41,270
how how we can uh maintain this process
like for example after

3742
01:53:41,270 --> 01:53:41,280
like for example after
 

3743
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:42,390
like for example after
the

3744
01:53:42,390 --> 01:53:42,400
the
 

3745
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,229
the
half a million

3746
01:53:44,229 --> 01:53:44,239
half a million
 

3747
01:53:44,239 --> 01:53:46,550
half a million
tvl inside the strategy it becomes

3748
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:46,560
tvl inside the strategy it becomes
 

3749
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:49,990
tvl inside the strategy it becomes
public or we can review it by our hands

3750
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:50,000
public or we can review it by our hands
 

3751
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,470
public or we can review it by our hands
or

3752
01:53:52,470 --> 01:53:52,480

 

3753
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:56,229

it will have like a voting process uh

3754
01:53:56,229 --> 01:53:56,239
it will have like a voting process uh
 

3755
01:53:56,239 --> 01:53:57,669
it will have like a voting process uh
from

3756
01:53:57,669 --> 01:53:57,679
from
 

3757
01:53:57,679 --> 01:53:58,629
from
the

3758
01:53:58,629 --> 01:53:58,639
the
 

3759
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:00,950
the
other strategy users

3760
01:54:00,950 --> 01:54:00,960
other strategy users
 

3761
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:02,390
other strategy users
also will lose

3762
01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:02,400
also will lose
 

3763
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:04,950
also will lose
about five pop-ups

3764
01:54:04,950 --> 01:54:04,960
about five pop-ups
 

3765
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:08,229
about five pop-ups
in our prototype and infinity of

3766
01:54:08,229 --> 01:54:08,239
in our prototype and infinity of
 

3767
01:54:08,239 --> 01:54:10,629
in our prototype and infinity of
tooltips because there we should have a

3768
01:54:10,629 --> 01:54:10,639
tooltips because there we should have a
 

3769
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:12,790
tooltips because there we should have a
lot of tool tips to explain everything

3770
01:54:12,790 --> 01:54:12,800
lot of tool tips to explain everything
 

3771
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:14,149
lot of tool tips to explain everything
for the user

3772
01:54:14,149 --> 01:54:14,159
for the user
 

3773
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:14,950
for the user
and

3774
01:54:14,950 --> 01:54:14,960
and
 

3775
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:17,510
and
thank you so much i'm really happy to be

3776

thank you so much i'm really happy to be
 

3777
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:20,070
thank you so much i'm really happy to be
a participant on this hackathon

3778
01:54:20,070 --> 01:54:20,080
a participant on this hackathon
 

3779
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:21,510
a participant on this hackathon
uh we're

3780
01:54:21,510 --> 01:54:21,520

uh like to any other team so uh how do
you plan to use uh

3802
01:54:40,870 --> 01:54:40,880
you plan to use uh
 

3803
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:42,950
you plan to use uh
cross chain and specifically october's

3804
01:54:42,950 --> 01:54:42,960
cross chain and specifically october's
 

3805
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:44,709
cross chain and specifically october's
bridge in your technology

3806
01:54:44,709 --> 01:54:44,719

bridge in your technology
and uh

3808
01:54:45,990 --> 01:54:46,000
and uh
 

3809
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,750
and uh
which specific protocols would you

3810
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:47,760
which specific protocols would you
 

3811
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:51,270
which specific protocols would you
target who is it uh we are having no any

3812
01:54:51,270 --> 01:54:51,280
target who is it uh we are having no any
 

3813
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:54,070
target who is it uh we are having no any
plans to use the cross chain and

3814
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:54,080
plans to use the cross chain and
 

3815
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:56,950
plans to use the cross chain and
bridge inside this product because it's

3816
01:54:56,950 --> 01:54:56,960
bridge inside this product because it's
 

3817
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:58,070
bridge inside this product because it's
useless

3818
01:54:58,070 --> 01:54:58,080
useless
 

3819
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:00,310
useless
for this product we cannot create a

3820
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:00,320
for this product we cannot create a
 

3821
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,950
for this product we cannot create a
strategy like cross chain strategies

3822
01:55:02,950 --> 01:55:02,960
strategy like cross chain strategies
 

3823
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:05,189
strategy like cross chain strategies
because we have a lot of problems inside

3824
01:55:05,189 --> 01:55:05,199
because we have a lot of problems inside
 

3825
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:07,430
because we have a lot of problems inside
for example you can

3826
01:55:07,430 --> 01:55:07,440
for example you can
 

3827
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:10,070
for example you can
hold the money on the on on the first

3828
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:10,080
hold the money on the on on the first
 

3829
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:12,229
hold the money on the on on the first
chain in the lending protocol and then

3830
01:55:12,229 --> 01:55:12,239
chain in the lending protocol and then
 

3831
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:14,470
chain in the lending protocol and then
trying to use the breach

3832
01:55:14,470 --> 01:55:14,480
trying to use the breach
 

3833
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:15,270
trying to use the breach
and

3834
01:55:15,270 --> 01:55:15,280
and
 

3835
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:17,750
and
use the farming on the other chains

3836
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:17,760
use the farming on the other chains
 

3837
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:20,310
use the farming on the other chains
if something happened behalf this part

3838
01:55:20,310 --> 01:55:20,320
if something happened behalf this part
 

3839
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:22,070
if something happened behalf this part
you will lose your whole strategy and

3840
01:55:22,070 --> 01:55:22,080
you will lose your whole strategy and
 

3841
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:24,550
you will lose your whole strategy and
you lose your whole

3842
01:55:24,550 --> 01:55:24,560
you lose your whole
 

3843
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:28,709
you lose your whole
assets inside so it's really uh like a

3844
01:55:28,709 --> 01:55:28,719
assets inside so it's really uh like a
 

3845
01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:31,750
assets inside so it's really uh like a
risk factor for this type of product of

3846
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:31,760
risk factor for this type of product of
 

3847
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:34,310
risk factor for this type of product of
using the cross chain first what we

3848
01:55:34,310 --> 01:55:34,320
using the cross chain first what we
 

3849
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:37,830
using the cross chain first what we
should do is the mvp on only one chain

3850
01:55:37,830 --> 01:55:37,840
should do is the mvp on only one chain
 

3851
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:40,550
should do is the mvp on only one chain
with like three or five projects after

3852
01:55:40,550 --> 01:55:40,560
with like three or five projects after
 

3853
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:42,709
with like three or five projects after
it we can think about the cross chain

3854
01:55:42,709 --> 01:55:42,719
it we can think about the cross chain
 

3855
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:45,750
it we can think about the cross chain
but uh behind this uh have a lot of

3856
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:45,760
but uh behind this uh have a lot of
 

3857
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:47,270

interact with other uh further library

4030
02:03:34,390 --> 02:03:34,400
interact with other uh further library
 

4031
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:36,470
interact with other uh further library
about the library i'm gonna talk a

4032
02:03:36,470 --> 02:03:36,480
about the library i'm gonna talk a
 

4033
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:38,149
about the library i'm gonna talk a
little bit further

4034
02:03:38,149 --> 02:03:38,159
little bit further
 

4035
02:03:38,159 --> 02:03:39,669
little bit further
so um

4036
02:03:39,669 --> 02:03:39,679
so um
 

4037
02:03:39,679 --> 02:03:42,229
so um
the um on the website we have like the

4038
02:03:42,229 --> 02:03:42,239
the um on the website we have like the
 

4039
02:03:42,239 --> 02:03:44,629
the um on the website we have like the
connection of the wallet and uh the

4040
02:03:44,629 --> 02:03:44,639
connection of the wallet and uh the
 

4041
02:03:44,639 --> 02:03:46,550
connection of the wallet and uh the
button that computes the reputation for

4042
02:03:46,550 --> 02:03:46,560
button that computes the reputation for
 

4043
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:50,069
button that computes the reputation for
the user for the current uh address

4044
02:03:50,069 --> 02:03:50,079
the user for the current uh address
 

4045
02:03:50,079 --> 02:03:53,030
the user for the current uh address
uh and i guess

4046
02:03:53,030 --> 02:03:53,040
uh and i guess
 

4047
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:56,390
uh and i guess
after the reputation is computed he can

4048
02:03:56,390 --> 02:03:56,400
after the reputation is computed he can
 

4049
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:57,669
after the reputation is computed he can
produce

4050
02:03:57,669 --> 02:03:57,679
produce
 

4051
02:03:57,679 --> 02:03:58,550
produce
the

4052
02:03:58,550 --> 02:03:58,560
the
 

4053
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:01,589
the
soul bound token on the everscale

4054
02:04:01,589 --> 02:04:01,599
soul bound token on the everscale
 

4055
02:04:01,599 --> 02:04:03,270
soul bound token on the everscale
or and

4056
02:04:03,270 --> 02:04:03,280
or and
 

4057
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:05,350
or and
further transfer this

4058
02:04:05,350 --> 02:04:05,360
further transfer this
 

4059
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:09,430
further transfer this
token on other blockchains

4060
02:04:09,430 --> 02:04:09,440

 

4061
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:12,229

so yeah um

4062
02:04:12,229 --> 02:04:12,239
so yeah um
 

4063
02:04:12,239 --> 02:04:16,550
so yeah um
the next uh site

4064
02:04:16,550 --> 02:04:16,560

 

4065
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:18,950

okay so what is the actually our

4066
02:04:18,950 --> 02:04:18,960
okay so what is the actually our
 

4067
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:21,910
okay so what is the actually our
reputation token um so our reputation

4068
02:04:21,910 --> 02:04:21,920
reputation token um so our reputation
 

4069
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:25,030
reputation token um so our reputation
token is uh actually is a non-functional

4070
02:04:25,030 --> 02:04:25,040
token is uh actually is a non-functional
 

4071
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:25,990
token is uh actually is a non-functional
token

4072
02:04:25,990 --> 02:04:26,000
token
 

4073
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,629
token
so after the user is

4074
02:04:28,629 --> 02:04:28,639
so after the user is
 

4075
02:04:28,639 --> 02:04:30,709
so after the user is
tapped on the button on the website the

4076
02:04:30,709 --> 02:04:30,719
tapped on the button on the website the
 

4077
02:04:30,719 --> 02:04:34,870
tapped on the button on the website the
reputation uh for him is computed um

4078
02:04:34,870 --> 02:04:34,880
reputation uh for him is computed um
 

4079
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:36,709
reputation uh for him is computed um
let's take a minute and i will explain

4080
02:04:36,709 --> 02:04:36,719
let's take a minute and i will explain
 

4081
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:39,270
let's take a minute and i will explain
you how we right now compute the

4082
02:04:39,270 --> 02:04:39,280
you how we right now compute the
 

4083
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:40,870
you how we right now compute the
reputation

4084
02:04:40,870 --> 02:04:40,880
reputation
 

4085
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:44,550
reputation
so um other um current uh technology

4086
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:44,560
so um other um current uh technology
 

4087
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:48,470
so um other um current uh technology
interacts with the octus bridge api

4088
02:04:48,470 --> 02:04:48,480
interacts with the octus bridge api
 

4089
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:51,189
interacts with the octus bridge api
so uh right now the formula is not that

4090
02:04:51,189 --> 02:04:51,199
so uh right now the formula is not that
 

4091
02:04:51,199 --> 02:04:53,669
so uh right now the formula is not that
complicated um

4092
02:04:53,669 --> 02:04:53,679
complicated um
 

4093
02:04:53,679 --> 02:04:55,830
complicated um
because it's temporary solution

4094
02:04:55,830 --> 02:04:55,840
because it's temporary solution
 

4095
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:56,950
because it's temporary solution
and

4096
02:04:56,950 --> 02:04:56,960
and
 

4097
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:59,910
and
how it works it's um

4098
02:04:59,910 --> 02:04:59,920
how it works it's um
 

4099
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:02,310
how it works it's um
checks for the address all of his

4100
02:05:02,310 --> 02:05:02,320

every scale and count their amounts
 

4105
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:10,950
every scale and count their amounts
and divide them by the old transaction

4106
02:05:10,950 --> 02:05:10,960
and divide them by the old transaction
 

4107
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:13,189
and divide them by the old transaction
he has and this is the current

and
what user can do about it he can um

4142
02:05:49,589 --> 02:05:49,599
what user can do about it he can um
 

4143
02:05:49,599 --> 02:05:52,310
what user can do about it he can um
transfer it to other chains i can give

4144
02:05:52,310 --> 02:05:52,320
transfer it to other chains i can give
 

4145
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:54,069
transfer it to other chains i can give
you a brief example

4146
02:05:54,069 --> 02:05:54,079
you a brief example
 

4147
02:05:54,079 --> 02:05:56,870
you a brief example
let's imagine that we have one

4148
02:05:56,870 --> 02:05:56,880
let's imagine that we have one
 

4149
02:05:56,880 --> 02:06:00,950
let's imagine that we have one
developer and he builds a product for

4150
02:06:00,950 --> 02:06:00,960
developer and he builds a product for
 

4151
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,709
developer and he builds a product for
um allowing people

4152
02:06:02,709 --> 02:06:02,719
um allowing people
 

4153
02:06:02,719 --> 02:06:03,589
um allowing people
uh

4154
02:06:03,589 --> 02:06:03,599
uh
 

4155
02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:04,629
uh
uh to

4156
02:06:04,629 --> 02:06:04,639
uh to
 

4157
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:06,470
uh to
uh compute their reputation on every

4158
02:06:06,470 --> 02:06:06,480
uh compute their reputation on every
 

4159
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:07,430
uh compute their reputation on every
scale

4160
02:06:07,430 --> 02:06:07,440

4161
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:09,750

so he uh he simply uh

4162
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:09,760
so he uh he simply uh
 

4163
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:14,069
so he uh he simply uh
uh he or she uh connects um our library

4164
02:06:14,069 --> 02:06:14,079
uh he or she uh connects um our library
 

4165
02:06:14,079 --> 02:06:14,950
uh he or she uh connects um our library
and

4166
02:06:14,950 --> 02:06:14,960
and
 

4167
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:18,310
and
um for one line of code and he can

4168
02:06:18,310 --> 02:06:18,320
um for one line of code and he can
 

4169
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:19,350
um for one line of code and he can
easily

4170
02:06:19,350 --> 02:06:19,360
easily
 

4171
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:22,069
easily
uh compute reputation from uh for the

4172
02:06:22,069 --> 02:06:22,079
uh compute reputation from uh for the
 

4173
02:06:22,079 --> 02:06:23,350
uh compute reputation from uh for the
user

user
let's imagine um another scenario we

4176
02:06:25,910 --> 02:06:25,920
let's imagine um another scenario we
 

4177
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:28,790
let's imagine um another scenario we
have other developers who

4178
02:06:28,790 --> 02:06:28,800
have other developers who
 

4179
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:32,709
have other developers who
are working on uh for instance the

4180
02:06:32,709 --> 02:06:32,719
are working on uh for instance the
 

4181
02:06:32,719 --> 02:06:34,629
are working on uh for instance the
website for landing

4182
02:06:34,629 --> 02:06:34,639
website for landing
 

4183
02:06:34,639 --> 02:06:37,109
website for landing
um on ethereum

um on ethereum
 

4185
02:06:37,119 --> 02:06:40,790
um on ethereum
uh so uh and they wanna to allow to use

4186
02:06:40,790 --> 02:06:40,800
uh so uh and they wanna to allow to use
 

4187
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:42,830
uh so uh and they wanna to allow to use
uh like they wanna

4188
02:06:42,830 --> 02:06:42,840
uh like they wanna
 

4189
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:46,550
uh like they wanna
um only specific amount of users use

4190
02:06:46,550 --> 02:06:46,560
um only specific amount of users use
 

4191
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:49,030
um only specific amount of users use
their function functionality so what

4192
02:06:49,030 --> 02:06:49,040
their function functionality so what
 

4193
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:50,709
their function functionality so what
they can do they can

4194
02:06:50,709 --> 02:06:50,719
they can do they can
 

4195
02:06:50,719 --> 02:06:53,430
they can do they can
also import our uh

4196
02:06:53,430 --> 02:06:53,440
also import our uh
 

4197
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:55,589
also import our uh
library and uh

4198
02:06:55,589 --> 02:06:55,599
library and uh
 

4199
02:06:55,599 --> 02:06:59,109
library and uh
like one line of code for instance um

4200
02:06:59,109 --> 02:06:59,119
like one line of code for instance um
 

4201
02:06:59,119 --> 02:07:01,189
like one line of code for instance um
check the user's uh

4202
02:07:01,189 --> 02:07:01,199
check the user's uh
 

4203
02:07:01,199 --> 02:07:03,589
check the user's uh
reputation

4204
02:07:03,589 --> 02:07:03,599
reputation
 

4205
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:08,390
reputation
sorry it's my cat

4206
02:07:08,390 --> 02:07:08,400

 

4207
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:09,350

and

4208
02:07:09,350 --> 02:07:09,360
and
 

4209
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:12,069
and
this reputation is

4210
02:07:12,069 --> 02:07:12,079
this reputation is
 

4211
02:07:12,079 --> 02:07:15,510
this reputation is
easily gathered from every scale and if

4212
02:07:15,510 --> 02:07:15,520
easily gathered from every scale and if
 

4213
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:18,870
easily gathered from every scale and if
it's good then

4214
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:18,880
it's good then
 

4215
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:21,669
it's good then
they can allow user to use the landing

4216
02:07:21,669 --> 02:07:21,679
they can allow user to use the landing
 

4217
02:07:21,679 --> 02:07:23,750
they can allow user to use the landing
if not

4218
02:07:23,750 --> 02:07:23,760
if not
 

4219
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:26,470
if not
it's not allowed to

4220
02:07:26,470 --> 02:07:26,480
it's not allowed to
 

4221
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:27,589
it's not allowed to
and

4222
02:07:27,589 --> 02:07:27,599
and
 

4223
02:07:27,599 --> 02:07:30,310
and
all right current smart contracts are

4224
02:07:30,310 --> 02:07:30,320
all right current smart contracts are
 

4225
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:33,270
all right current smart contracts are
written on solidity and deployed

4226
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:33,280
written on solidity and deployed
 

4227
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:36,390
written on solidity and deployed
on the network using clock lift

4228
02:07:36,390 --> 02:07:36,400
on the network using clock lift
 

4229
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:38,390
on the network using clock lift
i want to talk a bit more about the

4230
02:07:38,390 --> 02:07:38,400
i want to talk a bit more about the
 

4231
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:42,229
i want to talk a bit more about the
implementation

4232
02:07:42,229 --> 02:07:42,239

 

4233
02:07:42,239 --> 02:07:44,550

uh so um

4234
02:07:44,550 --> 02:07:44,560
uh so um
 

4235
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:47,109
uh so um
um there is one one big problem uh

4236
02:07:47,109 --> 02:07:47,119
um there is one one big problem uh
 

4237
02:07:47,119 --> 02:07:50,709
um there is one one big problem uh
because um when the user created a

4238
02:07:50,709 --> 02:07:50,719
because um when the user created a
 

4239
02:07:50,719 --> 02:07:52,470
because um when the user created a
soulbound token on

4240
02:07:52,470 --> 02:07:52,480
soulbound token on
 

4241
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:56,390
soulbound token on
ethereum blockchain um he

4242
02:07:56,390 --> 02:07:56,400
ethereum blockchain um he
 

4243
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:58,950
ethereum blockchain um he
cannot transfer it to um

4244
02:07:58,950 --> 02:07:58,960
cannot transfer it to um
 

4245
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:02,310
cannot transfer it to um
other chains because uh current

4246
02:08:02,310 --> 02:08:02,320
other chains because uh current
 

4247
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:05,109
other chains because uh current
octus bridge not allow to transfer the

4248
02:08:05,109 --> 02:08:05,119
octus bridge not allow to transfer the
 

4249
02:08:05,119 --> 02:08:06,790
octus bridge not allow to transfer the
non-functional token

4250
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:06,800
non-functional token
 

4251
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:08,390
non-functional token
so we have a simple

4252
02:08:08,390 --> 02:08:08,400
so we have a simple
 

4253
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:10,229
so we have a simple
uh hack for this

4254
02:08:10,229 --> 02:08:10,239
uh hack for this
 

4255
02:08:10,239 --> 02:08:13,669
uh hack for this
uh this hack is um

4256
02:08:13,669 --> 02:08:13,679
uh this hack is um
 

4257
02:08:13,679 --> 02:08:16,870
uh this hack is um
like using uh uses the functional token

4258
02:08:16,870 --> 02:08:16,880
like using uh uses the functional token
 

4259
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:20,709
like using uh uses the functional token
so this uh reputation uh is

4260
02:08:20,709 --> 02:08:20,719
so this uh reputation uh is
 

4261
02:08:20,719 --> 02:08:22,790
so this uh reputation uh is
from non-tangible token goes to fungible

4262
02:08:22,790 --> 02:08:22,800
from non-tangible token goes to fungible
 

4263
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:25,270
from non-tangible token goes to fungible
token this punchable token is

4264
02:08:25,270 --> 02:08:25,280
token this punchable token is
 

4265
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:27,990
token this punchable token is
transferred to uh another chain using

4266
02:08:27,990 --> 02:08:28,000
transferred to uh another chain using
 

4267
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:31,030
transferred to uh another chain using
octus bridge and uh on the other chain

4268
02:08:31,030 --> 02:08:31,040
octus bridge and uh on the other chain
 

4269
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:32,390
octus bridge and uh on the other chain
um

4270
02:08:32,390 --> 02:08:32,400
um
 

4271
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:35,189
um
we produce a sl bound token this is a

4272
02:08:35,189 --> 02:08:35,199
we produce a sl bound token this is a
 

4273
02:08:35,199 --> 02:08:37,430
we produce a sl bound token this is a
temporary implementation but they think

4274
02:08:37,430 --> 02:08:37,440
temporary implementation but they think
 

4275
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:40,229
temporary implementation but they think
that the next versions of ocus breach

4276
02:08:40,229 --> 02:08:40,239
that the next versions of ocus breach
 

4277
02:08:40,239 --> 02:08:42,069
that the next versions of ocus breach
can allow us to easily

4278
02:08:42,069 --> 02:08:42,079
can allow us to easily
 

4279
02:08:42,079 --> 02:08:44,629
can allow us to easily
transfer all bound tokens

4280
02:08:44,629 --> 02:08:44,639
transfer all bound tokens
 

4281
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:45,430
transfer all bound tokens
uh

4282
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:45,440
uh
 

4283
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:46,950
uh
yeah

4284
02:08:46,950 --> 02:08:46,960
yeah
 

4285
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:50,149
yeah
next

4286
02:08:50,149 --> 02:08:50,159

 

4287
02:08:50,159 --> 02:08:52,709

it's really simple other developers can

4288
02:08:52,709 --> 02:08:52,719
it's really simple other developers can
 

4289
02:08:52,719 --> 02:08:54,709
it's really simple other developers can
um uh implement the connection on the

4290
02:08:54,709 --> 02:08:54,719
um uh implement the connection on the
 

4291
02:08:54,719 --> 02:08:57,669
um uh implement the connection on the
wallets and

4292
02:08:57,669 --> 02:08:57,679

 

4293
02:08:57,679 --> 02:09:00,709

import our library this library can

4294
02:09:00,709 --> 02:09:00,719
import our library this library can
 

4295
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:02,470
import our library this library can
either

4296
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:02,480
either
 

4297
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:05,030
either
compute the reputation of the user uh

4298
02:09:05,030 --> 02:09:05,040
compute the reputation of the user uh
 

4299
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:08,390
compute the reputation of the user uh
and creates album token or it can breach

we created a website and we implemented
several tokens it's fungible talking and

4344
02:10:04,229 --> 02:10:04,239
several tokens it's fungible talking and
 

4345
02:10:04,239 --> 02:10:06,229
several tokens it's fungible talking and
non-fungible talking

4346
02:10:06,229 --> 02:10:06,239
non-fungible talking
 

4347
02:10:06,239 --> 02:10:09,430
non-fungible talking
but in the future

4348
02:10:09,430 --> 02:10:09,440

 

4349
02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:11,430

we think
 

4351
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:12,550
we think
it was

non-fungible token
 

4357
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:20,470
non-fungible token
and this token

4358
02:10:20,470 --> 02:10:20,480
and this token
 

4359
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:23,109
and this token
will be transferred between blockchain

4360
02:10:23,109 --> 02:10:23,119
will be transferred between blockchain
 

4361
02:10:23,119 --> 02:10:25,669
will be transferred between blockchain

support the nft transfer for now but uh

4384
02:10:50,149 --> 02:10:50,159
support the nft transfer for now but uh
 

4385
02:10:50,159 --> 02:10:52,310
support the nft transfer for now but uh
because there are a lot of situations uh

4386
02:10:52,310 --> 02:10:52,320
because there are a lot of situations uh
 

4387
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:54,310
because there are a lot of situations uh
that you need to tackle uh in terms of

that you need to tackle uh in terms of
 

4389
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:57,109
that you need to tackle uh in terms of
nfc transfer but we plan doing this in

4390
02:10:57,109 --> 02:10:57,119
nfc transfer but we plan doing this in
 

4391
02:10:57,119 --> 02:10:58,629
nfc transfer but we plan doing this in
the nearest future so it's already in

4392
02:10:58,629 --> 02:10:58,639
the nearest future so it's already in
 

4393
02:10:58,639 --> 02:10:59,910
the nearest future so it's already in

4394
02:10:59,910 --> 02:10:59,920
development
 

4395
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:02,950
development
um yeah so actually uh my first question

4396
02:11:02,950 --> 02:11:02,960
um yeah so actually uh my first question
 

4397
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:05,030
um yeah so actually uh my first question
uh to you uh

4398
02:11:05,030 --> 02:11:05,040
uh to you uh
 

4399
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:06,790
uh to you uh
would be

4400
02:11:06,790 --> 02:11:06,800
would be
 

4401
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:09,189
would be
what kind of scoring do you see

4402
02:11:09,189 --> 02:11:09,199
what kind of scoring do you see
 

4403
02:11:09,199 --> 02:11:11,830
what kind of scoring do you see
to check the reputation would it be an

4404
02:11:11,830 --> 02:11:11,840
to check the reputation would it be an
 

4405
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:14,229
to check the reputation would it be an
aggregate score for uh

4406
02:11:14,229 --> 02:11:14,239
aggregate score for uh
 

4407
02:11:14,239 --> 02:11:16,629
aggregate score for uh
for a user or rather it would be split

4408
02:11:16,629 --> 02:11:16,639
for a user or rather it would be split
 

4409
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:18,550
for a user or rather it would be split
into categories

uh to be honest they can easily

4432
02:11:45,109 --> 02:11:45,119
uh to be honest they can easily
 

4433
02:11:45,119 --> 02:11:48,149
uh to be honest they can easily
create their work and edit the algorithm

4434
02:11:48,149 --> 02:11:48,159
create their work and edit the algorithm
 

4435
02:11:48,159 --> 02:11:51,030
create their work and edit the algorithm
maybe choose their own apis

4436
02:11:51,030 --> 02:11:51,040
maybe choose their own apis
 

4437
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:52,870
maybe choose their own apis
uh yeah

4438
02:11:52,870 --> 02:11:52,880
uh yeah
 

4439
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:55,430
uh yeah
it's really like scalable solution

02:11:55,430 --> 02:11:55,440
it's really like scalable solution
 

4441
02:11:55,440 --> 02:11:58,709
it's really like scalable solution
customizable also yeah

have actually any code in place
 

4461
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:27,430
have actually any code in place
yeah yeah we have um the implementation

4462

of the website um
 

4465
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:31,830
of the website um
so you can check it out or we have not

4466
02:12:31,830 --> 02:12:31,840
so you can check it out or we have not
 

4467
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:35,430
so you can check it out or we have not
fully built smart contracts uh yeah

4468
02:12:35,430 --> 02:12:35,440
fully built smart contracts uh yeah
 

4469
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:37,270
fully built smart contracts uh yeah
and because we have limited amount of

4470
02:12:37,270 --> 02:12:37,280
and because we have limited amount of
 

4471
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:40,390
and because we have limited amount of
time but if we like had more time we

4472

yeah it's yeah of course because we

4482
02:12:50,470 --> 02:12:50,480
yeah it's yeah of course because we
 

4483
02:12:50,480 --> 02:12:53,270
yeah it's yeah of course because we
think that the idea of uh like soulbound

4484
02:12:53,270 --> 02:12:53,280
think that the idea of uh like soulbound
 

4485
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:54,870
think that the idea of uh like soulbound
tokens is um

4486
02:12:54,870 --> 02:12:54,880
tokens is um
 

4487
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:55,830
tokens is um
really

4488
02:12:55,830 --> 02:12:55,840

you have something like 20 25 minutes

4546
03:00:54,150 --> 03:00:54,160
you have something like 20 25 minutes
 

4547
03:00:54,160 --> 03:00:56,230
you have something like 20 25 minutes
depends on the number of questions so i

4548
03:00:56,230 --> 03:00:56,240
depends on the number of questions so i
 

4549
03:00:56,240 --> 03:00:59,269
depends on the number of questions so i
would target 20 minutes to leave some

4550
03:00:59,269 --> 03:00:59,279
would target 20 minutes to leave some
 

4551
03:00:59,279 --> 03:01:02,070
would target 20 minutes to leave some
some space for for questions if any yeah

4552
03:01:02,070 --> 03:01:02,080
some space for for questions if any yeah
 

4553
03:01:02,080 --> 03:01:07,269
some space for for questions if any yeah
that's fine

4554

so uh we observed the landscape of the

4604
03:02:06,469 --> 03:02:06,479
so uh we observed the landscape of the
 

4605
03:02:06,479 --> 03:02:08,790
so uh we observed the landscape of the
everscale community and decided that

4606
03:02:08,790 --> 03:02:08,800
everscale community and decided that
 

4607
03:02:08,800 --> 03:02:10,870
everscale community and decided that
okay there is still no

4608
03:02:10,870 --> 03:02:10,880
okay there is still no
 

4609
03:02:10,880 --> 03:02:14,389
okay there is still no
proper sbt implementation and we decided

4610
03:02:14,389 --> 03:02:14,399
proper sbt implementation and we decided
 

4611
03:02:14,399 --> 03:02:17,429
proper sbt implementation and we decided
to employ to employ uh vitalik's

4612
03:02:17,429 --> 03:02:17,439
to employ to employ uh vitalik's
 

4613
03:02:17,439 --> 03:02:19,910
to employ to employ uh vitalik's
architecture and create

4614
03:02:19,910 --> 03:02:19,920
architecture and create
 

4615
03:02:19,920 --> 03:02:22,070
architecture and create
maybe one of the first nodes but one of

03:02:53,510 --> 03:02:53,520
everybody understand that uh there is
 

4647
03:02:53,520 --> 03:02:56,150
everybody understand that uh there is
kind of a problem in the field of web 3

4648
03:02:56,150 --> 03:02:56,160
kind of a problem in the field of web 3
 

4649
03:02:56,160 --> 03:02:59,030
kind of a problem in the field of web 3
where we have said anonymous accounts

4650
03:02:59,030 --> 03:02:59,040
where we have said anonymous accounts
 

4651
03:02:59,040 --> 03:03:01,590
where we have said anonymous accounts
numerous of them and we still do not

4652
03:03:01,590 --> 03:03:01,600
numerous of them and we still do not
 

4653
03:03:01,600 --> 03:03:05,030
numerous of them and we still do not
know uh how many real person like human

4654
03:03:05,030 --> 03:03:05,040
know uh how many real person like human
 

4655
03:03:05,040 --> 03:03:07,510
know uh how many real person like human
beings are using uh

4656
03:03:07,510 --> 03:03:07,520
beings are using uh
 

4657
03:03:07,520 --> 03:03:09,349
beings are using uh
any blockchain ecosystem including

4658
03:03:09,349 --> 03:03:09,359
any blockchain ecosystem including
 

4659
03:03:09,359 --> 03:03:10,550
any blockchain ecosystem including

everscale
 

4661
03:03:10,560 --> 03:03:13,110
everscale
and that's the problem for

4662
03:03:13,110 --> 03:03:13,120
and that's the problem for
 

4663
03:03:13,120 --> 03:03:15,590
and that's the problem for
all investors for all projects because

4664
03:03:15,590 --> 03:03:15,600
all investors for all projects because
 

4665
03:03:15,600 --> 03:03:17,830
all investors for all projects because
uh there are lots of botnets that

4666
03:03:17,830 --> 03:03:17,840
uh there are lots of botnets that
 

4667
03:03:17,840 --> 03:03:18,950
uh there are lots of botnets that
simulate

get significant air drops from battery
 

4675
03:03:27,200 --> 03:03:29,670
get significant air drops from battery
services therefore uh like we believe

4676
03:03:29,670 --> 03:03:29,680
services therefore uh like we believe
 

4677
03:03:29,680 --> 03:03:32,630
services therefore uh like we believe
that current air drop paradigm is not

4678
03:03:32,630 --> 03:03:32,640
that current air drop paradigm is not
 

4679
03:03:32,640 --> 03:03:35,349
that current air drop paradigm is not
effective uh and we believe that there

4680
03:03:35,349 --> 03:03:35,359
effective uh and we believe that there
 

4681
03:03:35,359 --> 03:03:37,269
effective uh and we believe that there
must be kind of

03:03:37,269 --> 03:03:37,279
must be kind of

03:03:49,670 --> 03:03:49,680
of economical activity which is
 

4693
03:03:49,680 --> 03:03:52,469
of economical activity which is
performed by botnet uh like this person

uh the other point is that uh many
 

4703
03:04:01,600 --> 03:04:04,230
uh the other point is that uh many
people in uh the world of web 3 they

people in uh the world of web 3 they
 

4705
03:04:04,240 --> 03:04:05,990
people in uh the world of web 3 they
don't have a clear

web3 ecosystem they still do not do not
 

4711
03:04:10,080 --> 03:04:11,830

know what to do here
 

4713
03:04:11,840 --> 03:04:13,670
know what to do here
and that's kind of a problem and we

4714
03:04:13,670 --> 03:04:13,680
and that's kind of a problem and we
 

4715
03:04:13,680 --> 03:04:15,429
and that's kind of a problem and we
believe that the system of decentralized

4716

believe that the system of decentralized
 

4717
03:04:15,439 --> 03:04:18,469
believe that the system of decentralized
reputation may create a new system of

reputation may create a new system of
incentivization for these users if you

03:04:20,630 --> 03:04:20,640
incentivization for these users if you
 

4721
03:04:20,640 --> 03:04:22,630
incentivization for these users if you
understand that if you gain a certain

contributions create nft collections uh

4730
03:04:32,389 --> 03:04:32,399
contributions create nft collections uh
 

4731
03:04:32,399 --> 03:04:34,550
contributions create nft collections uh
that can be recorded and all these

4732
03:04:34,550 --> 03:04:34,560
that can be recorded and all these
 

4733
03:04:34,560 --> 03:04:37,670
that can be recorded and all these
reputational events later can be used uh

4734
03:04:37,670 --> 03:04:37,680
reputational events later can be used uh
 

4735
03:04:37,680 --> 03:04:41,510
reputational events later can be used uh
by you to get bonuses benefits access to

4736
03:04:41,510 --> 03:04:41,520
by you to get bonuses benefits access to
 

4737
03:04:41,520 --> 03:04:44,630
by you to get bonuses benefits access to
what uh clubs or whatever

4738
03:04:44,630 --> 03:04:44,640
what uh clubs or whatever
 

4739
03:04:44,640 --> 03:04:46,870
what uh clubs or whatever
therefore we believe that uh like

4740
03:04:46,870 --> 03:04:46,880
therefore we believe that uh like
 

4741
03:04:46,880 --> 03:04:48,870
therefore we believe that uh like
decentralized reputation is a good case

4742
03:04:48,870 --> 03:04:48,880
decentralized reputation is a good case
 

4743
03:04:48,880 --> 03:04:50,870
decentralized reputation is a good case
for a

4744
03:04:50,870 --> 03:04:50,880
for a
 

4745
03:04:50,880 --> 03:04:55,429
for a
proper web 3 user journey map

4746
03:04:55,429 --> 03:04:55,439

 

4747
03:04:55,439 --> 03:04:58,070

and we decided to use the architecture

4748
03:04:58,070 --> 03:04:58,080
and we decided to use the architecture
 

4749
03:04:58,080 --> 03:05:00,790
and we decided to use the architecture
that was proposed by vitalik

4750
03:05:00,790 --> 03:05:00,800
that was proposed by vitalik
 

4751
03:05:00,800 --> 03:05:03,190
that was proposed by vitalik
during our implementation but in our

4752
03:05:03,190 --> 03:05:03,200
during our implementation but in our
 

4753
03:05:03,200 --> 03:05:05,269
during our implementation but in our
implementation we created a sole

4754
03:05:05,269 --> 03:05:05,279
implementation we created a sole
 

4755
03:05:05,279 --> 03:05:07,830
implementation we created a sole
contract which is a controller for

4756
03:05:07,830 --> 03:05:07,840
contract which is a controller for
 

4757
03:05:07,840 --> 03:05:10,389
contract which is a controller for
reputational events for sbts sold bound

4758
03:05:10,389 --> 03:05:10,399
reputational events for sbts sold bound
 

4759
03:05:10,399 --> 03:05:12,790
reputational events for sbts sold bound
tokens and we created sbts as well we

4760
03:05:12,790 --> 03:05:12,800
tokens and we created sbts as well we
 

4761
03:05:12,800 --> 03:05:14,710
tokens and we created sbts as well we
created three spd's

4762
03:05:14,710 --> 03:05:14,720
created three spd's
 

4763
03:05:14,720 --> 03:05:16,070
created three spd's
uh like

4764
03:05:16,070 --> 03:05:16,080
uh like
 

4765
03:05:16,080 --> 03:05:17,190
uh like
these

4766
03:05:17,190 --> 03:05:17,200
these
 

4767
03:05:17,200 --> 03:05:19,349
these
contracts were created on the basis of

4768
03:05:19,349 --> 03:05:19,359
contracts were created on the basis of
 

4769
03:05:19,359 --> 03:05:20,469
contracts were created on the basis of
uh

4770
03:05:20,469 --> 03:05:20,479
uh
 

4771
03:05:20,479 --> 03:05:25,030
uh
tip four token like nfc token itself and

4772
03:05:25,030 --> 03:05:25,040
tip four token like nfc token itself and
 

4773
03:05:25,040 --> 03:05:26,950
tip four token like nfc token itself and
we uh additionally created the

4774
03:05:26,950 --> 03:05:26,960
we uh additionally created the
 

4775
03:05:26,960 --> 03:05:29,670
we uh additionally created the
collection for uh these tokens

4776
03:05:29,670 --> 03:05:29,680
collection for uh these tokens
 

4777
03:05:29,680 --> 03:05:32,630
collection for uh these tokens
uh we did not manage to create a social

4778
03:05:32,630 --> 03:05:32,640
uh we did not manage to create a social
 

4779
03:05:32,640 --> 03:05:34,550
uh we did not manage to create a social
recovery mechanism because like it

4780
03:05:34,550 --> 03:05:34,560
recovery mechanism because like it
 

4781
03:05:34,560 --> 03:05:37,110
recovery mechanism because like it
requires several more days to implement

4782
03:05:37,110 --> 03:05:37,120
requires several more days to implement
 

4783
03:05:37,120 --> 03:05:39,510
requires several more days to implement
and we did not um

4784
03:05:39,510 --> 03:05:39,520
and we did not um
 

4785
03:05:39,520 --> 03:05:42,070
and we did not um
prepare for this hackathon in advance

4786
03:05:42,070 --> 03:05:42,080
prepare for this hackathon in advance
 

4787
03:05:42,080 --> 03:05:45,110
prepare for this hackathon in advance
uh therefore uh like social recovery is

4788
03:05:45,110 --> 03:05:45,120
uh therefore uh like social recovery is
 

4789
03:05:45,120 --> 03:05:46,870
uh therefore uh like social recovery is
not something that that we are going to

4790
03:05:46,870 --> 03:05:46,880
not something that that we are going to
 

4791
03:05:46,880 --> 03:05:47,910
not something that that we are going to
do in

4792
03:05:47,910 --> 03:05:47,920
do in
 

4793
03:05:47,920 --> 03:05:50,230
do in
our next milestones

4794
03:05:50,230 --> 03:05:50,240
our next milestones
 

4795
03:05:50,240 --> 03:05:51,590
our next milestones
of the project

4796
03:05:51,590 --> 03:05:51,600
of the project
 

4797
03:05:51,600 --> 03:05:55,110
of the project
so some words about like our use case

4798
03:05:55,110 --> 03:05:55,120
so some words about like our use case
 

4799
03:05:55,120 --> 03:05:57,910
so some words about like our use case
uh we created a system of uh

4800
03:05:57,910 --> 03:05:57,920
uh we created a system of uh
 

4801
03:05:57,920 --> 03:06:00,309
uh we created a system of uh
achievements which were received by a

4802
03:06:00,309 --> 03:06:00,319
achievements which were received by a
 

4803
03:06:00,319 --> 03:06:01,269
achievements which were received by a
person

4804
03:06:01,269 --> 03:06:01,279
person
 

4805
03:06:01,279 --> 03:06:01,990
person
uh

4806
03:06:01,990 --> 03:06:02,000
uh
 

4807
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:05,349
uh

03:09:26,800 --> 03:09:28,150
our
sbts

4978
03:09:28,150 --> 03:09:28,160
sbts
 

4979
03:09:28,160 --> 03:09:30,550
sbts
so i should insert enter sbt token

4980
03:09:30,550 --> 03:09:30,560
so i should insert enter sbt token
 

4981
03:09:30,560 --> 03:09:31,670
so i should insert enter sbt token
address

4982
03:09:31,670 --> 03:09:31,680
address
 

4983
03:09:31,680 --> 03:09:33,670
address
uh and during my demonstration i will

4984
03:09:33,670 --> 03:09:33,680
uh and during my demonstration i will
 

4985
03:09:33,680 --> 03:09:35,830
uh and during my demonstration i will
just import two tokens and mint another

4986
03:09:35,830 --> 03:09:35,840
just import two tokens and mint another
 

4987
03:09:35,840 --> 03:09:38,389
just import two tokens and mint another
one

4988
03:09:38,389 --> 03:09:38,399

 

4989
03:09:38,399 --> 03:09:41,750

okay here i can

4990
03:09:41,750 --> 03:09:41,760
okay here i can
 

4991
03:09:41,760 --> 03:09:44,550
okay here i can
just wait for a second

4992
03:09:44,550 --> 03:09:44,560
just wait for a second
 

4993
03:09:44,560 --> 03:09:46,389
just wait for a second
it may take some time

4994
03:09:46,389 --> 03:09:46,399
it may take some time
 

4995
03:09:46,399 --> 03:09:49,990
it may take some time
because everything is live

4996
03:09:49,990 --> 03:09:50,000

 

4997
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:58,070

okay

4998
03:09:58,070 --> 03:09:58,080

 

4999
03:09:58,080 --> 03:10:03,429

okay i inserted my collection address

5000
03:10:03,429 --> 03:10:03,439

 

5001
03:10:03,439 --> 03:10:07,510

and here i can find

5002
03:10:07,510 --> 03:10:07,520

 

5003
03:10:07,520 --> 03:10:10,229

nft address and then address for the

5004
03:10:10,229 --> 03:10:10,239
nft address and then address for the
 

5005
03:10:10,239 --> 03:10:12,150
nft address and then address for the
personality

5006
03:10:12,150 --> 03:10:12,160
personality
 

5007
03:10:12,160 --> 03:10:13,349

5019
03:10:29,120 --> 03:10:33,030

so when i'm now i'm going to

5020
03:10:33,030 --> 03:10:33,040

 

5021
03:10:33,040 --> 03:10:36,790

5023
03:10:36,800 --> 03:10:39,349

let me just wait for a second let's mint

5024
03:10:39,349 --> 03:10:39,359
let me just wait for a second let's mint
 

5025
03:10:39,359 --> 03:10:41,510
let me just wait for a second let's mint
it

5026
03:10:41,510 --> 03:10:41,520
it
 

5027
03:10:41,520 --> 03:10:43,910
it
a private club member

5028
03:10:43,910 --> 03:10:43,920
a private club member
 

5029
03:10:43,920 --> 03:10:46,070
a private club member
remains

5030
03:10:46,070 --> 03:10:46,080
remains
 

5031
03:10:46,080 --> 03:10:50,229

so address

5034
03:10:59,590 --> 03:10:59,600

 

5035
03:10:59,600 --> 03:11:02,630

oops

5036

5037
03:11:02,640 --> 03:11:12,389

remove the keyboard

5038
03:11:12,389 --> 03:11:12,399

 

5039
03:11:12,399 --> 03:11:21,670

sending a message

5040
03:11:21,670 --> 03:11:21,680

 

5041
03:11:21,680 --> 03:11:27,990

so waiting for the fastest test net

5042
03:11:27,990 --> 03:11:28,000

 

5043
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:29,269

5044
03:11:29,269 --> 03:11:29,279
okay
 

5045
03:11:29,279 --> 03:11:39,110
okay
it's done

5046
03:11:39,110 --> 03:11:39,120

 

5047
03:11:39,120 --> 03:11:42,309

yeah it's here

5048
03:11:42,309 --> 03:11:42,319

 

5049
03:11:42,319 --> 03:11:49,110

so i'm copying the third nft address

5050
03:11:49,110 --> 03:11:49,120

 

5051
03:11:49,120 --> 03:11:53,030

and important so uh here we have like

5052
03:11:53,030 --> 03:11:53,040
and important so uh here we have like
 

5053
03:11:53,040 --> 03:11:55,750
and important so uh here we have like
kind of automated uh verification scheme

5054
03:11:55,750 --> 03:11:55,760
kind of automated uh verification scheme
 

5055
03:11:55,760 --> 03:11:57,830
kind of automated uh verification scheme
because we decided to hard hold it

5056
03:11:57,830 --> 03:11:57,840
because we decided to hard hold it
 

5057
03:11:57,840 --> 03:12:00,389
because we decided to hard hold it
because like basically this verification

5058
03:12:00,389 --> 03:12:00,399
because like basically this verification
 

5059
03:12:00,399 --> 03:12:02,389
because like basically this verification
skill depends on the

5060
03:12:02,389 --> 03:12:02,399
skill depends on the
 

5061
03:12:02,399 --> 03:12:04,710
skill depends on the
needs of a certain verifier if for

5062
03:12:04,710 --> 03:12:04,720
needs of a certain verifier if for
 

5063
03:12:04,720 --> 03:12:06,550
needs of a certain verifier if for
example this my awesome exchange will

5064
03:12:06,550 --> 03:12:06,560
example this my awesome exchange will
 

5065
03:12:06,560 --> 03:12:07,990
example this my awesome exchange will
need much more

5066
03:12:07,990 --> 03:12:08,000
need much more
 

5067
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:09,110
need much more
um

5068
03:12:09,110 --> 03:12:09,120
um
 

5069
03:12:09,120 --> 03:12:11,590
um
like sbts from various collections not

5070
03:12:11,590 --> 03:12:11,600
like sbts from various collections not
 

5071
03:12:11,600 --> 03:12:13,590
like sbts from various collections not
from the one collection obviously they

5072
03:12:13,590 --> 03:12:13,600
from the one collection obviously they
 

5073
03:12:13,600 --> 03:12:14,309
from the one collection obviously they
can

5074
03:12:14,309 --> 03:12:14,319
can
 

5075
03:12:14,319 --> 03:12:16,710
can
create their own data scheme and

5076
03:12:16,710 --> 03:12:16,720
create their own data scheme and
 

5077
03:12:16,720 --> 03:12:18,550
create their own data scheme and
this data schema can be performed on the

5078
03:12:18,550 --> 03:12:18,560
this data schema can be performed on the
 

5079
03:12:18,560 --> 03:12:20,469
this data schema can be performed on the
smart contract so basically we can do

5080
03:12:20,469 --> 03:12:20,479
smart contract so basically we can do
 

5081
03:12:20,479 --> 03:12:23,030
smart contract so basically we can do
everything uh on chain but it is

5082
03:12:23,030 --> 03:12:23,040
everything uh on chain but it is
 

5083
03:12:23,040 --> 03:12:25,030
everything uh on chain but it is
something that we are going to do

5084
03:12:25,030 --> 03:12:25,040
something that we are going to do
 

5085
03:12:25,040 --> 03:12:28,630
something that we are going to do
in our further milestones

5086
03:12:28,630 --> 03:12:28,640
in our further milestones
 

5087
03:12:28,640 --> 03:12:31,349
in our further milestones
so uh let me proceed with

5088
03:12:31,349 --> 03:12:31,359
so uh let me proceed with
 

5089
03:12:31,359 --> 03:12:33,830
so uh let me proceed with
my presentation

5090
03:12:33,830 --> 03:12:33,840
my presentation
 

5091
03:12:33,840 --> 03:12:36,389
my presentation
here is like our definition of done sole

5092
03:12:36,389 --> 03:12:36,399
here is like our definition of done sole
 

5093
03:12:36,399 --> 03:12:39,110
here is like our definition of done sole
contract sbt insurance model

5094
03:12:39,110 --> 03:12:39,120
contract sbt insurance model
 

5095
03:12:39,120 --> 03:12:41,510
contract sbt insurance model
sbt collection and like front-end app

5096
03:12:41,510 --> 03:12:41,520
sbt collection and like front-end app
 

5097
03:12:41,520 --> 03:12:44,070
sbt collection and like front-end app
for demonstrating the use case and

5098
03:12:44,070 --> 03:12:44,080
for demonstrating the use case and
 

5099
03:12:44,080 --> 03:12:47,990
for demonstrating the use case and
verification of the sbts so everything

5100
03:12:47,990 --> 03:12:48,000
verification of the sbts so everything
 

5101
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:52,790
verification of the sbts so everything
you can find in our github repositories

5102
03:12:52,790 --> 03:12:52,800
you can find in our github repositories
 

5103
03:12:52,800 --> 03:12:55,830
you can find in our github repositories
and some words about further steps

5104
03:12:55,830 --> 03:12:55,840
and some words about further steps
 

5105
03:12:55,840 --> 03:12:58,070
and some words about further steps
we would like to proceed with the

5106
03:12:58,070 --> 03:12:58,080
we would like to proceed with the
 

5107
03:12:58,080 --> 03:12:59,830
we would like to proceed with the
development of the social recovery tool

5108
03:12:59,830 --> 03:12:59,840
development of the social recovery tool
 

5109
03:12:59,840 --> 03:13:01,429
development of the social recovery tool
because we believe that it is of huge

5110
03:13:01,429 --> 03:13:01,439
because we believe that it is of huge
 

5111
03:13:01,439 --> 03:13:04,630
because we believe that it is of huge
importance uh people may uh lose their

5112
03:13:04,630 --> 03:13:04,640
importance uh people may uh lose their
 

5113
03:13:04,640 --> 03:13:07,590
importance uh people may uh lose their
keys they may want to transfer

5114
03:13:07,590 --> 03:13:07,600
keys they may want to transfer
 

5115
03:13:07,600 --> 03:13:09,269
keys they may want to transfer
uh like

5116
03:13:09,269 --> 03:13:09,279
uh like
 

5117
03:13:09,279 --> 03:13:12,150
uh like
some parts of their reputation uh

5118
03:13:12,150 --> 03:13:12,160
some parts of their reputation uh
 

5119
03:13:12,160 --> 03:13:13,830
some parts of their reputation uh
but it's not an orthodox scheme for

5120
03:13:13,830 --> 03:13:13,840
but it's not an orthodox scheme for
 

5121
03:13:13,840 --> 03:13:15,510
but it's not an orthodox scheme for
vitalik but anyway

5122
03:13:15,510 --> 03:13:15,520
vitalik but anyway
 

5123
03:13:15,520 --> 03:13:16,550
vitalik but anyway
uh

5124
03:13:16,550 --> 03:13:16,560
uh
 

5125
03:13:16,560 --> 03:13:18,469
uh
obviously we want to automate like the

5126
03:13:18,469 --> 03:13:18,479
obviously we want to automate like the
 

5127
03:13:18,479 --> 03:13:20,469
obviously we want to automate like the
soul creation because like in this use

5128
03:13:20,469 --> 03:13:20,479
soul creation because like in this use
 

5129
03:13:20,479 --> 03:13:22,630
soul creation because like in this use
case it is hardcoded but we want our

5130
03:13:22,630 --> 03:13:22,640
case it is hardcoded but we want our
 

5131
03:13:22,640 --> 03:13:26,070
case it is hardcoded but we want our
users to create uh their their own souls

5132
03:13:26,070 --> 03:13:26,080
users to create uh their their own souls
 

5133
03:13:26,080 --> 03:13:27,190
users to create uh their their own souls
in uh

5134
03:13:27,190 --> 03:13:27,200
in uh
 

5135
03:13:27,200 --> 03:13:29,830
in uh
user-friendly interface without using

5136
03:13:29,830 --> 03:13:29,840
user-friendly interface without using
 

5137
03:13:29,840 --> 03:13:32,389
user-friendly interface without using
ibs and jsons and

5138
03:13:32,389 --> 03:13:32,399
ibs and jsons and
 

5139
03:13:32,399 --> 03:13:34,469
ibs and jsons and
copying addresses as i did in our

5140
03:13:34,469 --> 03:13:34,479
copying addresses as i did in our
 

5141
03:13:34,479 --> 03:13:36,710
copying addresses as i did in our
demonstration and we would like to

5142
03:13:36,710 --> 03:13:36,720
demonstration and we would like to
 

5143
03:13:36,720 --> 03:13:39,110
demonstration and we would like to
create the verification that data scheme

5144
03:13:39,110 --> 03:13:39,120
create the verification that data scheme
 

5145

that uh
 

5169
03:14:05,040 --> 03:14:09,110
that uh
will move uh every scale to the top

5170
03:14:09,110 --> 03:14:09,120
will move uh every scale to the top
 

5171
03:14:09,120 --> 03:14:12,150
will move uh every scale to the top
so that's it some credits to my guys who

uh so the first question traditionally

5202
03:14:46,550 --> 03:14:46,560
uh so the first question traditionally
 

5203
03:14:46,560 --> 03:14:48,309
uh so the first question traditionally
so how do you plan to

5204
03:14:48,309 --> 03:14:48,319
so how do you plan to
 

5205
03:14:48,319 --> 03:14:50,710
so how do you plan to
use octa's bridge technology so within

5206
03:14:50,710 --> 03:14:50,720
use octa's bridge technology so within
 

5207
03:14:50,720 --> 03:14:53,190
use octa's bridge technology so within
your product

5208
03:14:53,190 --> 03:14:53,200
your product
 

5209
03:14:53,200 --> 03:14:55,349
your product
well basically we can use octopus breach

5210
03:14:55,349 --> 03:14:55,359
well basically we can use octopus breach
 

5211
03:14:55,359 --> 03:14:57,190
well basically we can use octopus breach
well uh um

5212
03:14:57,190 --> 03:14:57,200
well uh um
 

5213
03:14:57,200 --> 03:14:59,510
well uh um
when the oculus bridge will implement uh

5214
03:14:59,510 --> 03:14:59,520
when the oculus bridge will implement uh
 

5215
03:14:59,520 --> 03:15:01,990
when the oculus bridge will implement uh
cross chain entities obviously that will

5216
03:15:01,990 --> 03:15:02,000
cross chain entities obviously that will
 

5217
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:03,830
cross chain entities obviously that will
be the greatest case from my personal

5218
03:15:03,830 --> 03:15:03,840
be the greatest case from my personal
 

5219
03:15:03,840 --> 03:15:06,229
be the greatest case from my personal
perspective the greatest case for

5220
03:15:06,229 --> 03:15:06,239
perspective the greatest case for
 

5221
03:15:06,239 --> 03:15:07,910
perspective the greatest case for
cross-chain reputation

5222
03:15:07,910 --> 03:15:07,920
cross-chain reputation
 

5223
03:15:07,920 --> 03:15:10,389
cross-chain reputation
so we are waiting for this solution

5224
03:15:10,389 --> 03:15:10,399
so we are waiting for this solution
 

5225
03:15:10,399 --> 03:15:11,990
so we are waiting for this solution
because uh

5226
03:15:11,990 --> 03:15:12,000
because uh
 

5227
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:13,830
because uh
basically you can create sole contracts

5228
03:15:13,830 --> 03:15:13,840
basically you can create sole contracts
 

5229
03:15:13,840 --> 03:15:15,670
basically you can create sole contracts
which will be controlled in the rescale

5230
03:15:15,670 --> 03:15:15,680
which will be controlled in the rescale
 

5231
03:15:15,680 --> 03:15:18,389
which will be controlled in the rescale
network and you may create sbts in other

5232
03:15:18,389 --> 03:15:18,399
network and you may create sbts in other
 

5233
03:15:18,399 --> 03:15:20,630
network and you may create sbts in other
networks and oculus bridge may

5234
03:15:20,630 --> 03:15:20,640
networks and oculus bridge may
 

5235
03:15:20,640 --> 03:15:24,309
networks and oculus bridge may
be a tool for managing this therefore we

5236
03:15:24,309 --> 03:15:24,319
be a tool for managing this therefore we
 

5237
03:15:24,319 --> 03:15:26,550
be a tool for managing this therefore we
are waiting for this technology stack of

5238
03:15:26,550 --> 03:15:26,560
are waiting for this technology stack of
 

5239
03:15:26,560 --> 03:15:28,389

uh
 

5857
04:05:20,560 --> 04:05:22,630
uh
so we get to the dow

5858
04:05:22,630 --> 04:05:22,640
so we get to the dow
 

5859
04:05:22,640 --> 04:05:24,309
so we get to the dow
daru deployment

5860

daru deployment
 

5861
04:05:24,319 --> 04:05:27,349
daru deployment
uh so after the successful uh deploy

5862
04:05:27,349 --> 04:05:27,359
uh so after the successful uh deploy
 

5863
04:05:27,359 --> 04:05:29,590
uh so after the successful uh deploy
deployment of the owl factory

5864
04:05:29,590 --> 04:05:29,600
deployment of the owl factory
 

5865
04:05:29,600 --> 04:05:32,670
deployment of the owl factory
you will need to generate the

5866
04:05:32,670 --> 04:05:32,680
you will need to generate the
 

5867
04:05:32,680 --> 04:05:34,710
you will need to generate the
platform.tvc file

5868
04:05:34,710 --> 04:05:34,720
platform.tvc file
 

5869
04:05:34,720 --> 04:05:36,469
platform.tvc file
in order to decode it and use it for the

5870
04:05:36,469 --> 04:05:36,479
in order to decode it and use it for the
 

5871
04:05:36,479 --> 04:05:37,990
in order to decode it and use it for the
dial deployment

5872
04:05:37,990 --> 04:05:38,000
dial deployment
 

5873
04:05:38,000 --> 04:05:39,670
dial deployment
later

5874
04:05:39,670 --> 04:05:39,680
later
 

5875
04:05:39,680 --> 04:05:42,229
later
these are the next few commands that

5876
04:05:42,229 --> 04:05:42,239
these are the next few commands that
 

5877
04:05:42,239 --> 04:05:46,070
these are the next few commands that
should be used to achieve it

5878
04:05:46,070 --> 04:05:46,080
should be used to achieve it
 

5879
04:05:46,080 --> 04:05:48,790
should be used to achieve it
uh and this should be the generated

5880
04:05:48,790 --> 04:05:48,800
uh and this should be the generated
 

5881
04:05:48,800 --> 04:05:49,910
uh and this should be the generated
output

5882
04:05:49,910 --> 04:05:49,920
output
 

5883
04:05:49,920 --> 04:05:51,830
output
uh

5884
04:05:51,830 --> 04:05:51,840
uh
 

5885
04:05:51,840 --> 04:05:52,950
uh
then

5886
04:05:52,950 --> 04:05:52,960
then
 

5887
04:05:52,960 --> 04:05:57,349
then
we can go to the next step

5888
04:05:57,349 --> 04:05:57,359

 

5889
04:05:57,359 --> 04:06:08,309

uh dolph uh this is how uh

5890
04:06:08,309 --> 04:06:08,319

 

5891
04:06:08,319 --> 04:06:17,670

uh

5892
04:06:17,670 --> 04:06:17,680

 

5893
04:06:17,680 --> 04:06:21,110

so in these steps we are using the

5894
04:06:21,110 --> 04:06:21,120
so in these steps we are using the
 

5895
04:06:21,120 --> 04:06:22,710
so in these steps we are using the
ever bitey

5896
04:06:22,710 --> 04:06:22,720
ever bitey
 

5897
04:06:22,720 --> 04:06:25,030
ever bitey
executor

5898
04:06:25,030 --> 04:06:25,040
executor
 

5899
04:06:25,040 --> 04:06:26,950
executor
we will input the address of the

5900
04:06:26,950 --> 04:06:26,960
we will input the address of the
 

5901
04:06:26,960 --> 04:06:29,349
we will input the address of the
deployed contract and load the abbey

5902
04:06:29,349 --> 04:06:29,359
deployed contract and load the abbey
 

5903
04:06:29,359 --> 04:06:32,150
deployed contract and load the abbey
file so that we can see all of the

5904
04:06:32,150 --> 04:06:32,160
file so that we can see all of the
 

5905
04:06:32,160 --> 04:06:34,630
file so that we can see all of the
functions that are available

5906
04:06:34,630 --> 04:06:34,640
functions that are available
 

5907
04:06:34,640 --> 04:06:37,110
functions that are available
in the deployed contracts

5908
04:06:37,110 --> 04:06:37,120
in the deployed contracts
 

5909
04:06:37,120 --> 04:06:40,070
in the deployed contracts
uh in this step we are using the address

5910
04:06:40,070 --> 04:06:40,080
uh in this step we are using the address
 

5911
04:06:40,080 --> 04:06:42,950
uh in this step we are using the address
of the dao factory so that we can deploy

5912
04:06:42,950 --> 04:06:42,960
of the dao factory so that we can deploy
 

5913
04:06:42,960 --> 04:06:48,389
of the dao factory so that we can deploy
new dao root

5914
04:06:48,389 --> 04:06:48,399

 

5915
04:06:48,399 --> 04:06:49,590

okay so

5916
04:06:49,590 --> 04:06:49,600
okay so
 

5917
04:06:49,600 --> 04:06:52,950
okay so
here is the

5918
04:06:52,950 --> 04:06:52,960

 

5919
04:06:52,960 --> 04:06:55,510

output when we clicked on the search

5920
04:06:55,510 --> 04:06:55,520
output when we clicked on the search
 

5921
04:06:55,520 --> 04:06:56,469
output when we clicked on the search
button

5922
04:06:56,469 --> 04:06:56,479
button
 

5923
04:06:56,479 --> 04:06:58,150
button
it consists out of

5924
04:06:58,150 --> 04:06:58,160
it consists out of
 

5925
04:06:58,160 --> 04:07:01,189
it consists out of
constructor uh the deploy method and

5926
04:07:01,189 --> 04:07:01,199
constructor uh the deploy method and
 

5927
04:07:01,199 --> 04:07:02,950
constructor uh the deploy method and
withdraw gas method

5928
04:07:02,950 --> 04:07:02,960
withdraw gas method
 

5929
04:07:02,960 --> 04:07:05,269
withdraw gas method
we will call the deploy method for

5930
04:07:05,269 --> 04:07:05,279
we will call the deploy method for
 

5931
04:07:05,279 --> 04:07:11,110
we will call the deploy method for
deploying dow root

5932
04:07:11,110 --> 04:07:11,120

 

5933
04:07:11,120 --> 04:07:12,070

so

5934
04:07:12,070 --> 04:07:12,080
so
 

5935
04:07:12,080 --> 04:07:15,110
so
when we click on the deploy method

5936
04:07:15,110 --> 04:07:15,120
when we click on the deploy method
 

5937
04:07:15,120 --> 04:07:16,389
when we click on the deploy method
there will be

5938
04:07:16,389 --> 04:07:16,399
there will be
 

5939
04:07:16,399 --> 04:07:19,429
there will be
parameters that are needed for the dow

5940
04:07:19,429 --> 04:07:19,439
parameters that are needed for the dow
 

5941
04:07:19,439 --> 04:07:23,590
parameters that are needed for the dow
root constructor constructor so that a

5942
04:07:23,590 --> 04:07:23,600
root constructor constructor so that a
 

5943
04:07:23,600 --> 04:07:26,550
root constructor constructor so that a
new download can be deployed

5944
04:07:26,550 --> 04:07:26,560
new download can be deployed
 

5945
04:07:26,560 --> 04:07:29,110
new download can be deployed
so first is the platform quote

5946
04:07:29,110 --> 04:07:29,120
so first is the platform quote
 

5947
04:07:29,120 --> 04:07:32,150
so first is the platform quote
that is the decoded code from the

5948
04:07:32,150 --> 04:07:32,160
that is the decoded code from the
 

5949
04:07:32,160 --> 04:07:33,830
that is the decoded code from the
platform.sol

5950
04:07:33,830 --> 04:07:33,840

next is the proposal configuration

5954
04:07:37,990 --> 04:07:38,000
next is the proposal configuration
 

5955

on extending this functionality to a

6004
04:08:38,389 --> 04:08:38,399
on extending this functionality to a
 

6005
04:08:38,399 --> 04:08:40,149
on extending this functionality to a
fully functional so think with

6006
04:08:40,149 --> 04:08:40,159
fully functional so think with
 

6007
04:08:40,159 --> 04:08:41,750
fully functional so think with

04:08:50,720 --> 04:08:52,550
we were thinking about making the
interface like

6020
04:08:52,550 --> 04:08:52,560
interface like

04:31:34,070 --> 04:31:34,080
using the application that is now
 

6213
04:31:34,080 --> 04:31:37,429
using the application that is now
available on ios only for

6214
04:31:37,429 --> 04:31:37,439
available on ios only for
 

6215
04:31:37,439 --> 04:31:39,670
available on ios only for
cypriot users

6216
04:31:39,670 --> 04:31:39,680
cypriot users
 

6217
04:31:39,680 --> 04:31:40,710
cypriot users
and

6218
04:31:40,710 --> 04:31:40,720
and
 

6219
04:31:40,720 --> 04:31:41,590
and
they

6220
04:31:41,590 --> 04:31:41,600
they
 

6221
04:31:41,600 --> 04:31:44,550
they
can earn money and tokens from

6222
04:31:44,550 --> 04:31:44,560
can earn money and tokens from
 

6223
04:31:44,560 --> 04:31:48,790
can earn money and tokens from
participating those events

6224
04:31:48,790 --> 04:31:48,800

 

6225
04:31:48,800 --> 04:31:51,269

so let's break down the

6226
04:31:51,269 --> 04:31:51,279
so let's break down the
 

6227
04:31:51,279 --> 04:31:53,510
so let's break down the
core loop of the

6228
04:31:53,510 --> 04:31:53,520
core loop of the
 

6229
04:31:53,520 --> 04:31:54,950
core loop of the
application

6230
04:31:54,950 --> 04:31:54,960
application
 

6231
04:31:54,960 --> 04:31:57,429
application
so because of the

6232
04:31:57,429 --> 04:31:57,439
so because of the
 

6233
04:31:57,439 --> 04:31:59,510
so because of the
model of the applications it is closed

6234
04:31:59,510 --> 04:31:59,520
model of the applications it is closed
 

6235
04:31:59,520 --> 04:32:00,229
model of the applications it is closed
so

6236
04:32:00,229 --> 04:32:00,239
so
 

6237
04:32:00,239 --> 04:32:03,269
so
not any not everyone can actually um

6238
04:32:03,269 --> 04:32:03,279
not any not everyone can actually um
 

6239
04:32:03,279 --> 04:32:06,309
not any not everyone can actually um
register in the application because

6240
04:32:06,309 --> 04:32:06,319
register in the application because
 

6241
04:32:06,319 --> 04:32:08,950
register in the application because
a user needs to have some special qr

6242
04:32:08,950 --> 04:32:08,960
a user needs to have some special qr
 

6243
04:32:08,960 --> 04:32:10,389
a user needs to have some special qr
code

6244
04:32:10,389 --> 04:32:10,399
code
 

6245
04:32:10,399 --> 04:32:12,630
code
so that he could access the application

6246
04:32:12,630 --> 04:32:12,640
so that he could access the application
 

6247
04:32:12,640 --> 04:32:14,229
so that he could access the application
and register himself

6248
04:32:14,229 --> 04:32:14,239
and register himself
 

6249
04:32:14,239 --> 04:32:18,550
and register himself
so we have we have example of john who

6250
04:32:18,550 --> 04:32:18,560
so we have we have example of john who
 

6251
04:32:18,560 --> 04:32:21,189
so we have we have example of john who
is not a user of evereef but his friend

6252
04:32:21,189 --> 04:32:21,199
is not a user of evereef but his friend
 

6253
04:32:21,199 --> 04:32:24,070
is not a user of evereef but his friend
alex has qr code and he already

6254
04:32:24,070 --> 04:32:24,080
alex has qr code and he already
 

6255
04:32:24,080 --> 04:32:26,469
alex has qr code and he already
registered in the application so alex

6256
04:32:26,469 --> 04:32:26,479
registered in the application so alex
 

6257
04:32:26,479 --> 04:32:29,429
registered in the application so alex
can share his qr code as an actual as an

6258
04:32:29,429 --> 04:32:29,439
can share his qr code as an actual as an
 

6259
04:32:29,439 --> 04:32:31,349
can share his qr code as an actual as an
activation link

6260
04:32:31,349 --> 04:32:31,359
activation link
 

6261
04:32:31,359 --> 04:32:32,309
activation link
to

04:32:32,309 --> 04:32:32,319
to
 

6263
04:32:32,319 --> 04:32:35,670
to
for john to join and register himself

6264
04:32:35,670 --> 04:32:35,680
for john to join and register himself
 

6265
04:32:35,680 --> 04:32:36,630
for john to join and register himself
um

6266
04:32:36,630 --> 04:32:36,640
um
 

6267
04:32:36,640 --> 04:32:39,590
um
straight after uh when when john joins

6268
04:32:39,590 --> 04:32:39,600
straight after uh when when john joins
 

6269
04:32:39,600 --> 04:32:43,830
straight after uh when when john joins
uh the brave he receives one token

6270
04:32:43,830 --> 04:32:43,840
uh the brave he receives one token
 

6271
04:32:43,840 --> 04:32:46,550
uh the brave he receives one token
called irv talking don't mix it with

6272
04:32:46,550 --> 04:32:46,560
called irv talking don't mix it with
 

6273
04:32:46,560 --> 04:32:49,750
called irv talking don't mix it with
every scale packing like different names

6274
04:32:49,750 --> 04:32:49,760
every scale packing like different names
 

6275
04:32:49,760 --> 04:32:51,349
every scale packing like different names
so

6276
04:32:51,349 --> 04:32:51,359
so
 

6277
04:32:51,359 --> 04:32:53,429
so
at that time john

6278
04:32:53,429 --> 04:32:53,439
at that time john
 

6279
04:32:53,439 --> 04:32:56,149
at that time john
owner of qr code he has some special

6280
04:32:56,149 --> 04:32:56,159
owner of qr code he has some special
 

6281
04:32:56,159 --> 04:33:00,550
owner of qr code he has some special
costume that allows him to earn tokens

6282
04:33:00,550 --> 04:33:00,560
costume that allows him to earn tokens
 

6283
04:33:00,560 --> 04:33:03,670
costume that allows him to earn tokens
just just because of um

04:42:16,400 --> 04:42:17,910
in step and it pretty much depends
depending on

6740
04:42:17,910 --> 04:42:17,920

in our case we have reverse model
 

6751
04:42:29,040 --> 04:42:30,230
in our case we have reverse model
because

6752
04:42:30,230 --> 04:42:30,240
because
 

6753
04:42:30,240 --> 04:42:33,270
because
we also have perspective of user and

6754
04:42:33,270 --> 04:42:33,280
