uh the first was the test one uh it's uh
for our internal project just to see how

1002
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160
for our internal project just to see how

it works and uh verify all the
 

1005
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,270
it works and uh verify all the
uh chain processes and uh the second uh

1006
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,280
uh chain processes and uh the second uh
 

1007
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,190
uh chain processes and uh the second uh
we actually after that we returned the

1008
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
we actually after that we returned the
 

1009
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,029
we actually after that we returned the
money to the people because

1010
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:09,039
money to the people because
 

1011
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,789
money to the people because
it was more um

1012
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:10,799
it was more um
 

1013
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,350
it was more um
convenient for us just to to test it

1014
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360
convenient for us just to to test it
 

1015
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,789
convenient for us just to to test it
this way

1016
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:14,799
this way
 

1017
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,630
this way
uh for the

1018
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:16,640
uh for the
 

1019
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,270
uh for the
other uh the second one it was a

1020
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,280
other uh the second one it was a
 

1021
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,390
other uh the second one it was a

uh you've mentioned briefly that you're
 

1049
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,669
uh you've mentioned briefly that you're
building an accelerator with everscale

1050
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
building an accelerator with everscale
 

1051
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,669
building an accelerator with everscale
which is exciting so can you please tell

1052
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:57,679
which is exciting so can you please tell
 

1053
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,630
which is exciting so can you please tell
us more about the goals here and how it

1054
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:00,640
us more about the goals here and how it
 

1055
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,230
us more about the goals here and how it
could benefit everscale

1056
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,240
could benefit everscale
 

1057
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,590
could benefit everscale
um

1058
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:05,600
um
 

1059
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,390
um
yeah yeah i think it's an incredible

1060
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400
yeah yeah i think it's an incredible
