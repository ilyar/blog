hi guys
hi everyone island
okay traditionally let's wait a couple
minutes for everyone to join
and then we will start
we're so few today
okay everybody hi
how are you
hi erin everything's from istanbul
hi matt how are you how are friton
turkey is doing
yeah we are working hard to establish
business in turkey and create awareness
we already started negotiation with the
eminent companies in turkey with nodra
we we are right now developing a plan i
hope
in a short while we will start
generating good results
okay very good
we are also collaborating with the guy
who has been nominated as a turkey sub
governance for over one year
on the free throne called europe
we try to combine with him our powers
but we are working locally he's in
moscow we should do
face-to-face meeting business culture
with a little bit different here and
support of the nodra we created a good
synergy
we are going from our own way to achieve
good results
okay okay very good thank you thank you
uh okay so let's start so uh i think we
should not wait for anyone
uh anymore so welcome everyone at our
34th
weekly defy governance call of uh of the
free tone
so we have few topics to discuss today
but i think that they will be
interesting
so uh we didn't have the call uh last
week because
uh of eibc event and
part of active members of the deficit
governance
we are attending this event and
they will tell today so what was going
on and
are there any interesting stuff that
relates to the defy world and
i think that we will start from aibc
results
and alexander what
are here so you wanted to start
yes yes yeah perfect here
at all conference was amazing
uh interesting maybe
some problem with organization
from organizators not from freetown side
it sometimes was hard to understand
where some meetings some
[Music]
speakers but
if we look uh in our
parts of conference and free tone stand
every uh every times was
so crowded so many people it's mean that
uh people interested in it what free
tome doing
why how etc and um
we had a a little section defy section
vera
and sometimes uh comes people
who want to speak about defy on free
tone
and i had a different conversation
um with for example
first inch comes ceo
first inch comes and we had a
big speaking big speech and
about um our
partnership possible partnership and we
decide to connect after that
maybe we will be interested in it
for us i think interesting sometimes hum
centralized exchange like la token
uh owner of la talking and
um we start from speaking that
[Music]
do we want to connect with centralized
exchange
and listing our token and we start from
but okay you can listen and pay for that
ask okay it's maybe fast not so
interesting for leasing in centralized
exchange and pay for
that maybe your needs to know more about
free tone and maybe you're interested uh
in free tone and after conversation
we connect through
whatsapp and he answered that okay we
can listen without payment free for you
because i understand that it's an
interesting blockchain
i mean that it was a good idea
uh to be in
to be free tone in such conference
and i think it's a
good idea to do in the future and of
course uh
if we talk about know for example about
me i will connect
with all this possible partnership to
do this partnership yes and if
some somebody has interest interesting
who had interest interest in
conversation
um about free tone device section
they can now discuss and
say to us what it was yes
thank you thank you thank you so maybe
uh we can even
invite the the ceo of one inch
it's one of our calls and have some
interesting discussion about the
decentralized exchanges
and the problems and uh issues
perspectives of the
future uh in different networks because
they are they s an aggregators of the
know more than i guess all of us
combined all together and it will be
really interesting to have such a guest
and
discuss some questions with him yes it's
a good idea we'll try to connect with
him and in this case he wanted
to speak about listing free tone only in
his wallet
okay uh will they want to do more i'm
not sure but we need to speak discuss
and i told with alexander fellata he
said it's a good idea we need to work
together and we will try to do it
okay perfect uh very good uh
alexander maybe uh a lot of maybe you
can tell us more about
what was going on in uh in dubai and uh
other were there any interesting topics
that
you managed to discuss in terms of defy
i mean it's kind of i think alexander
said it right
it's um for me it's like kind of fade
out of chance there were some leads so i
would not
say some breakthrough leads um
like i i don't think le token is the
most reputable exchange
absolutely yes
from my personal standpoint although i
like
the founder he's a cool guy valentine
but a little bit of a dreamer
uh i mean everybody knows i guess that
we won the um
blockchain innovation of the year
category thanks to the voting by our
community yeah how it was
actually so uh tell us your emotions so
uh so uh who did we compete with
actually
well we compete with of course uh there
was i think there was
coinbase craic and finance ourselves and
polkadot
really
i wish no no i think it was in our
categories it was i think cardano
uh if i'm not mistaken and i think there
was one inch
so those were the two ones worth
mentioning and the rest i don't even
know
and i hope the fact that we were not we
were platinum sponsors did not help us
to win
i hope
it was good certainly good exposure we
have a lot of things to learn to do
better in the future conferences
i think uh one noticeable lead is that
uh
i think the defy alliance folks tatiana
specifically are talking to
there is very two conferences uh which
are focused on investors
as one in hong kong and one in dubai
so i think that's something we should
follow up on yeah
otherwise it's kind of a lot of leads
here and there
uh and again a lot of folks from the
defy lines were there so uh
very good following up on those leads
it's not
it's not worth mentioning all of them no
i think yeah absolutely
absolutely uh
okay so is there anyone else anzora
maybe
i'm wrong but i i have seen you on the
photos so you also alexander i'm sorry
nice to meet you it can be a bit off
topic can you uh
accept me on linkedin as well please i
sent
your request yeah thank you
okay i will sorry i'm not i'm like it's
too much stuff
but would you yeah okay
yeah can you hear me
yeah sure yeah okay yeah i was there and
there was a
yeah well the conference was pretty
pretty cool and the
free town was i think the coolest one
and people were coming reaching out to
me
in the smoking area
saying well you have such a nice booth
well because i was wearing a t-shirt
there was like
they were like oh you you're wearing the
freaking t-shirt tell us more about
freetom we've
heard the book and it was really really
cool and uh
most most of my of my teaching happened
actually in the smoking area because
this you know
this is where that's normal yeah this is
where the
the most interesting stuff happens
usually and uh people from the media
people from the exchanges even some
hedge funds were like wow what are you
doing and
they weren't all so much interested but
i
i didn't stop teaching so i was like
uh trying to to get
more info out there about friton because
as i found out
uh people are not uh people who
are not following triton specifically
they're not really familiar with what
we're doing they're like
they're they're not really familiar with
our practices
of contests and how we develop stuff
how how there's a lot of well there's a
ton of
open source codes released every month
so
uh yeah i don't know about that but this
conference it wasn't really that much
well it was it was one of the
conferences
as i know this maybe maybe i'm not
completely right but it wasn't very
blockchain
if you know what i mean it wasn't very
just
decentralized it was a lot about hype it
was not about
centralized exchanges trying to list
everything
and the cpa networks
and stuff like that so there was
barely any depth there was mostly
people who were like
trying to to to find out what's what's
happening what's hypey
what's what's the next big thing and
uh well people who really understood
what i was talking about
about the freetown about the five
possibilities the nft
and stuff like that they were really
excited after all and
oh because it was a bit
a bit um disappointing for me to to know
that
that to know that freetown is not
as like uh
as familiar to most of the people
uh because well uh even though
even though my story usually started
with like you know
there was a you know telegram you know
once this project yeah once upon a time
there was telegraph yeah there was stone
but then when there was the great the
big bad sec
that uh sort of stopped this whole thing
and we carried on and
yeah so
people were usually asking like uh what
what's the the big things happening in
triton
and i told them about the the different
access
that we have and different stuff that's
happening like
dns and bots specifically
but there was you know there's like
they were usually asking about i also
told them about the bridge
so uh were the bridges
so uh it wasn't uh like
they were looking for some end products
to
to interact with so i usually gave them
some links to our live products that
were working in the ecosystem but
i think most of the people are expecting
more
to sort of have something that's already
in production state and to use something
because most of the stuff
around us in the detail space is popping
up and
we're offering some stuff so i what what
i think we have to
get out of this is like oh let's get to
work let's let's release more products
that's
uh let's and
there's just as
we have to do nice products we also have
to tell
a lot of people well as many people as
possible
and devs companies partners about those
products because
also presented in the right yeah and
that's where we suffer actually that's
and that's why we were at
abc actually for people to to learn more
about free time
yeah yeah i think it worked i think it
worked
we'll see we'll see yeah yeah hopefully
hopefully yeah
okay uh alexey marabio
will you say a couple of words also
yeah hi everyone yes
i agree with andrew there were a lot of
people on this conference
lots of payments financial banking
and other guys
basically me i have met the founders of
one inch
pitched them our defi ecosystem in
freighton
and we agreed to like move forward to
discuss
like potential cooperation they have
like funds
for the five projects that they can
provide liquidity with they can
integrate
free throw methods to their wallet
sounds really interesting yeah
yeah so that's that's the
most most useful contact there
yeah actually actually uh normally on
such conferences
uh if you got at least one result it's
already good enough
so you have several so you're a hero
okay okay thank you so much uh
chuck eugene probably you want to say
something because i
also have seen you on photos yeah well
it was a good event uh some nice people
uh
the thing that actually was surprising
the most
was there i think there were more uh
people from belarus than from russia
and because you know when you sit down
with them it turns out yeah they're from
minsk
and i didn't expect that but
uh otherwise obviously it's uh it's no
secret that uh
arabs don't let neither chinese no
americans in right now
so that explains that most of the people
are from europe uh
very good event i met some interesting
people there was a guy from israel who
sells
airplanes private airplanes okay
and yeah but he also does kind of all
kinds of things
so maybe we'll do something together and
it was very nice to actually meet
everyone in person because
except ron who didn't go i haven't seen
anyone in person
ever you really
have have you been to a freedom party no
yeah
no i it was in moscow so i couldn't go
to moscow as well
okay okay okay see probably next year
we'll host
the event in some other city maybe in
seoul or somewhere else
in minsk yeah okay okay hopefully
hopefully we will not be grounded by mix
all right and free means free means
yeah probably not be located in belarus
this pre-minsk uh okay
okay guys uh thank you so much for your
comments so it was really interesting to
learn from the first hand
so what was going on there uh so
we uh slightly move into the next topic
uh
so we have a new contest in the line
coming
so it's a stone that we discussed uh
on the previous call actually so it was
polished it was
improved and now it's waiting for
uh governance members approval in the
governance interface
uh there's some issue right now with the
interface
because i cannot load it now to see how
how much people already voted
but uh yeah you just need to do as usual
go to the governance interface and cost
you about oh it's 42
already so we need one more vote uh
yeah so if you feel capable to
participate in the contest
uh it starts from tomorrow and it will
last for two
two months uh so and you will need to
implement a tip three esteton uh token
that can be
used to rob your uh
rights for uh the staked
tokens in the polls for different ways
of uh
staking from an ordinary stake to the
best instinct
and all other other stuff that you have
there
so if you have any questions so don't
hesitate to ask
uh pavel and media probably uh
so about how deep will work and also
there is a a lot of documentation right
now
so that's attached to this contest so
i think that it should be interesting
and will not pose
some some difficulties for participants
yes please
so do i understand well that this
wrapped
st token should provide
like the same interface as depooled
tokens is likely it's available for for
staked tokens so kind of transfer
and etc should
should i perform same operations like i
can perform with my state
with this token or or kind of
like what does it mean like token
representing the stake
uh if i understand right i'm not the
developer
however but the token should be the
owner of the stick so and
whoever owns the token so uh he can
claim
the stake from the depot but i might be
wrong pavel
are you here maybe you can comment yes
yes absolutely that's the whole point
so so that's why uh tokens uh
correct this is correct yes
that's why representatives
is that for ordinary states all tokens
are fungible
but for invested stakes
they are different depending on number
of cycles of testing
so that's a peculiarity which i added
into that
proposal
but it will be fun it will be
interesting to have like
100 different uh thoughts
how should uh how should this token
behave uh
if if depot is terminated kind of uh
let's not call it talking it's not it's
smart contract so
it should get the balance uh from the
pool
ah okay so so this this token actually
is not kind of token but is a
transferable
nfc kind of stuff right i mean
everything is my contact and
if you didn't know so that address will
be
in the pool uh
will be the owner in the pool and that
and if
the pool is dissolved then
that address will get tons that's very
simple
very good uh the contest
so sorry i wanna just just comment uh
the contest does not impose
uh any specific architecture uh on how
you will do this
tips3 token uh it can be nft it can be
something else uh
so it's up to you actually so uh just
if you if you prefer using nft uh so
it's up to you uh
the the question the additional question
also short uh
is uh like we we we this contest uh
is created and it assumes like
it implies some value which we will
like uh additional value in for defy
from this token can you please describe
uh like uh
kind of some mechanics
which will be possible with uh with this
kind of
yeah yeah it's it's it's very easy and
that's why it's very
exciting uh you can use uh this tokens
like for as a collateral for uh nd5
so it means that you stake you get you
you state focus you get rewards and you
use that token as a collateral to some
uh defy to get another another tones
then you can use those stones for to to
stake
uh another dipole so then you can
increase your yield by using that
mechanics
that's great mechanics yeah maybe some
like additional use cases like it it
will really help
to create maybe better architecture for
what the token the more use cases are
assumed the
the better the architecture it led
liquidity
so the file is for the fight it's very
important to have a lot of liquidity
in ecosystem and this will add
everything which from a mistake
will be able to participate in device so
we will
get significant boost in liquidity in
defined
yep i can i can describe
some mechanics for example in uh
invest note you will be able to put your
token for
some years for three and four years
and if you will put your liquidity and
you will not be able to operate with
liquidity
it will be a very bad proposition for
for investors because in defy
and defy and for yes horizons
it's it's antonyms and
if investors still be able to operate
with liquidity
through some derivatives like a stone
it will be more attractive for them and
in
texas we will put some liquidity for
farming for its token and
i think we will create big pool uh tone
to tone like one uh and and uh
aston like another hand and it will be
i think it will be trade with some
discount to tone and it will be
they'll be very interesting opportunity
for trading
so it will cost a little bit less than
original tone
or more i think it will be cost less but
uh market will show
like okay yeah i saw i saw before
similar mechanics
uh with frank's shares in other
protocols
just for from one perspective it should
be it should be
it should cost more because it uh like
provides additional
rewards but from another perspective it
is locked so
yeah yeah yes it's so so i think it will
be fun trading
fun trading all right
okay any other questions on this topic
guys
no very good uh one small announcement
before we
move to the uh presentation of the third
stage of the polkadot bridge
uh it's about the farming program that
is currently held
on the town swap dota uh
it will be continued today starting from
uh
8 p.m uh moscow time
or 7 p.m cet time
so if you if you want to participate so
just
be prepared and monitor closely once
the farming pools appear there so
it's easy as usual is usually
and now we move on to the
final topic of today's agenda so uh alex
from
windex team so are you here yes yes
um can i ask you to already first
meet pablo yeah yeah okay uh okay
everyone
uh nice day uh as you might remember
uh the last time we have demonstrated
development
uh we already successfully transferred
tip3 tokens with uh
in the bridge but at that point we only
had one relay node
uh in stage three of the bridge
development the main task was
uh distribution of relay responsibility
we will go step by step just like the
last time and explain what we're doing
while we're doing this
in order to show this okay uh as you
can you see the screen now yes yes
okay very good uh we started the two
nodes which is a free tone and another
substrate base node
and we run a setup which sends the
initial value to contracts and deploy
them to a local tone
also set up the substrate node for
interacting with dot on protocol
we are waiting for the container to
finish setup
by the way this uh setup now it also
deploys the first relay node
uh now we need to start many relay nodes
in this contest in order to show that
the distribution of really no
notes exist and we named them
alice bob and charlie which is just
random names that we've
chosen okay
now we're still waiting for the initial
setup to finish and
well like i said maybe you you can
describe
uh what you are going to present so
which which features
exactly uh well
today the main uh feature which is
uh distribution of the relays
responsibility
basically means that there will be not
one but
three relay nodes and there will be
some stage of choosing who is voting for
the proposal and who is not voting for
for the proposal to simplify it in a
very simple way um unfortunately the
presentation is a little bit
um more like uh console run
uh but now okay we are ready to continue
now we are starting the first the layman
which called the alice
and after which we need to deploy the
rest relay nodes which is bob and
charlie so we're deploying both
one second yeah it's done and now we
need to check the log
no okay let's let's stop the charlie
first
okay we deployed the charlie now we need
to open the lock windows for alice
bob and charlie which which are three
relay notes basically
one second
okay so at this setup what we have
created is three delay nodes
uh in this
demonstration two of them should be
active at any
one time so what we created three three
delay nodes but only two would have to
vote
uh it's it's done on a purpose
so
[Music]
make run pop okay
no we still we're still opening the log
windows which we will need
a little bit later in the demonstration
to see that the
uh the chosen node
is working properly so we can see what's
going on okay
so we are starting the charlie node and
going to
look of the charlie
okay so now we have basically three
windows
with three logs of three layers on the
screen right now as you can see
yes yes okay our relaying nodes
sending the public keys to vrf results
and signatures
to both chains and our algorithm
is sorting relaying nodes in accordance
to via ref results and signatures
in order to choose the active relay
nodes i'm sorry it might sound
complicated but it's actually very
simple
uh basically in the background we
seeing the two active nodes and one
inactive node
to simplify it that's all uh
it's a lot of text on the screen but it
will be all right
so to um to sort of
see that it's working properly we will
transfer
funds from uh
from substrate node to a free tone node
and while we do this we will also see in
the logs that
you know the two relay nodes will work
and one will not
as as it's supposed to happen so
we started with initiating the transfer
of tokens from
substrate account to let's see the
address and the balance
from substrate account
one second
we didn't we didn't
yeah we didn't we didn't load the
balances yet
it's the first time we're doing it so
let's uh
let's see if the balances are okay
it's in another screen i'm sorry
okay it's all done the address and the
balance of the
uh pre-deployed wallet on the free tone
network
uh the balance is zero so we copy
address
and uh signing the transaction in a
substrate and submit
now we need to check the relay node log
to see
when the relay node will show us the
that it's got the event
the initial event of the transaction
and while probably you're in the wrong
window
oh hold on a second dimitri you are
you're showing still the browser
can you change the window we apologize
we will change it now
can you see the console yes yes we do
okay very good thank you
very much for suggesting us
resolve message okay we see the result
message uh
in which one is this local analysis
okay the alice is working so the relay
note of alice
is chosen and it's voting and we will
see the other
uh log files of the box
yeah and one two okay
bob is active yes okay the bulb is also
active
and by the consequence so we need to go
to
the charlie must be
inactive so we will not see the active
sign as the
in in other log files
okay uh we see
yeah the chosen is false which basically
proves that
the three delay notes that we
demonstrated now
only two of them are chosen to vote for
the
uh proposal and one is chosen not to
vote
it's all done on the purpose so to
to come kind of um
yeah that the this is the last bit of it
we just
showing that the balance has changed
which means the tone balance
is updated and the transaction is
final basically that's all we have
on the screen to show uh it's all done
uh we will just mention that in regards
to ci cd
we have added the commands to deploy and
start the additional relay
nodes we have updated the documentation
as it is
everything we have demonstrated and the
documentation
everything that's updated is already
deployed on a github
as always we ask teams to join in
testing and checking the milestone
if you have any question during the
testing of this milestone it's normal uh
please do not hesitate asking us
in the chat or send us a messages we we
will be more than happy to explain
as we go down the development of the
bridge it's getting a little bit more
complex
so it's absolutely normal for people to
ask us questions
so we can negotiate this thank you very
much everyone for listening
vladimir thank you thank you alex
very nice result guys do you have any
questions
maybe suggestions
seems no ivan maybe you have
what's the chime in when are we going to
see the volcano
you know bridge in the final shape
um yeah it's a it's a very good question
it's uh it depends on many many things
uh in including not only our team of
developers
so we are i'm not quite ready to say the
exact date and time
i can probably guess that it will
happen uh right after the last stage of
the bridge which will implement
both economics and slashing conditions
and rights after so
it is generally
um yeah ivan please
yeah like bridges are not my
strongest uh uh understanding
but but uh nevertheless the question is
uh as far as i know
uh in polka that we have uh kind of
power chains
and is it is that bridge can organize
communication
between arbitrary parachain and
arbitrary for it on
like um
yeah like favorite on my net or
or it it just communicates must change
of of this blockchains
uh yes evan i'm sorry uh yes this
product
is uh developed with parachains
there are some uh can can you hear me
there are some exceptions that my
um so to simplify yes it is
made on parachains but if you need to
get in a little bit deeper into this
subject i suggest
like write it down and we can
communicate in
more common language okay
okay
so it's kind of deep right yes it's not
on the surface
to be exact i'm not technically deep and
i might say
something not exactly correct but it is
yes generally speaking yes it is
developed with power chains of course
yes
okay and as as far as we know uh brox's
ethereum bridge is made in a way that
it can broadcast arbitrary
uh events not only uh like transfers
uh of native token or erc20 tokens but
arbitrary
uh events and uh is it some
is is there some uh like uh
similar possibility to the in polkadot
to be able to
like communicate like arbitrary events
um i'm not very familiar with um
with bronx's bridge i mean we are
familiar we know that it's exist we know
they're developing but we're not that
deeply
uh involved in it we can have a look on
it and just uh
like in as usual in the chat we will
give you the um
the full answer on this question if you
don't mind speaking
speaking simpler can i can i for example
bridge uh
smart contract calls
uh yeah just to simplify to simple
answer yes you can yes
hello good fine thank you thank you
okay it's fine i thought you could you
couldn't hear me
very good thank you alex thank you ivan
so
does anyone have other questions
to win the steam please don't be shy
guys are here to answer your questions
okay seems now in that case
just just a small also minor
announcement that's a contest
proposal for st town contest so it
actually passed
and it will be transferred uh to the
active contests
part later today so
congrats everyone and developers prepare
okay uh that's it for today actually for
today's agenda and
uh for the next time uh
i'm i'm really looking into having
an interesting discussion on the landing
in freetown so if you have
uh some expertise in this part or you
know
someone from the big protocols like uh
i know like compound or maybe from
centralized uh
credit institutions like nexo or celsius
network
um i will not propose block fee because
they were hacked here recently
uh so yeah you can invite also them
to to to our weekly call and
we will have some interesting discussion
on how
the uh collateralized landing first of
all uh should look like
uh in freetown and using its
decentralized nature and
what is the future of the blockchain
landing
uh so i'm aiming to
to have the discussion next time so and
if anyone can help me in preparing this
so i will be really really grateful to
you
uh yeah so that's it from my site so if
you have
any open topics to discuss so just raise
your hand and the floor is yours
three two one
no one okay guys thank you so much for
attending and
have a nice weekend and uh see you next
time
bye bye bye bye
yes
