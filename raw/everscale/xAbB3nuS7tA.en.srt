let's go ahead and hop right in uh
 

177
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,030
let's go ahead and hop right in uh
technical updates are first as always

178
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
technical updates are first as always
 

179
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,749
technical updates are first as always
mita you can start us off

180
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
mita you can start us off
 

181
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,270
mita you can start us off
yeah

182
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280
yeah
 

183
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,270
yeah
well we're still not

184
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
well we're still not
 

185
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,230
well we're still not
not delivered the update to the network

186
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
not delivered the update to the network
 

187
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,590
not delivered the update to the network
it takes a little longer because

188
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
it takes a little longer because
 

189
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,590
it takes a little longer because
it's a little bit uh complicated

190
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
it's a little bit uh complicated
 

191
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,110
it's a little bit uh complicated
because the changes we are going to

192
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
because the changes we are going to
 

193
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,270
because the changes we are going to
introduce are breaking changes

194
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
introduce are breaking changes
 

195
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,390
introduce are breaking changes
and

196
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
and
 

197
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,110
and
the problem with that

198
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
the problem with that
 

199
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,189
the problem with that
is it's not only breaking changes in

200
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
is it's not only breaking changes in
 

201
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,350
is it's not only breaking changes in
terms of the node it's also breaking

202
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
terms of the node it's also breaking
 

203
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,310
terms of the node it's also breaking
changes in terms of the sdk and all of

204
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
changes in terms of the sdk and all of
 

205
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,310
changes in terms of the sdk and all of
that which follows

206
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
that which follows
 

207
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,110
that which follows
and that means that

208
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
and that means that
 

209
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,749
and that means that
we kind of need to find a way

210
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
we kind of need to find a way
 

211
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,710
we kind of need to find a way
to

212
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
to
 

213
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,870
to
kind of gracefully

214
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
kind of gracefully
 

215
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,629
kind of gracefully
change without breaking

216
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
change without breaking
 

217
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,270
change without breaking
everyone's applications out there

218
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
everyone's applications out there
 

219
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,310
everyone's applications out there
so

220
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
so
 

221
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,510
so
and the problem with that is that

222
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
and the problem with that is that
 

223
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,670
and the problem with that is that
unfortunately

224
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
unfortunately
 

225
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,150
unfortunately
the previous design didn't accommodate

226
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
the previous design didn't accommodate
 

227
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,710
the previous design didn't accommodate
for any extension extensions it wasn't

228
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
for any extension extensions it wasn't
 

229
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,430
for any extension extensions it wasn't
extendable it isn't extendable at all

230
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
extendable it isn't extendable at all
 

231
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,469
extendable it isn't extendable at all
so like

232
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
so like
 

233
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,710
so like
someone who designed that didn't think

234
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
someone who designed that didn't think
 

235
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,189
someone who designed that didn't think
that the design would never ever need to

236
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
that the design would never ever need to
 

237
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,150
that the design would never ever need to
be

238
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
be
 

239
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,070
be
extended to anything like that's the

240
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
extended to anything like that's the
 

241
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,950
extended to anything like that's the
final design this is as great as it gets

242
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
final design this is as great as it gets
 

243
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,550
final design this is as great as it gets
and so on and so forth you know that

244
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
and so on and so forth you know that
 

245
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,670
and so on and so forth you know that
drill

246
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
drill
 

247
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,629
drill
so well apparently it is not so

248
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
so well apparently it is not so
 

249
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,550
so well apparently it is not so
it's need to be upgraded

250
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
it's need to be upgraded
 

251
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,590
it's need to be upgraded
and

252
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
and
 

253
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,590
and
with many things

254
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
with many things
 

255
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,510
with many things
current upgrades and the future upgrades

256
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
current upgrades and the future upgrades
 

257
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,430
current upgrades and the future upgrades
so anyway

258
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
so anyway
 

259
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,990
so anyway
this is there's a lot of internal kind

260
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
this is there's a lot of internal kind
 

261
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,510
this is there's a lot of internal kind
of

262
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
of
 

263
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,990
of
discussions how to do that properly

264
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
discussions how to do that properly
 

265
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,390
discussions how to do that properly
were conducted in the end we kind of

266
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
were conducted in the end we kind of
 

267
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,870
were conducted in the end we kind of
settled on something it's not yet fully

268
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
settled on something it's not yet fully
 

269
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,790
settled on something it's not yet fully
implemented and there's also because it

270
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
implemented and there's also because it
 

271
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,670
implemented and there's also because it
involves also the transition plan

272
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
involves also the transition plan
 

273
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,990
involves also the transition plan
for for the sdk and you know the

274
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
for for the sdk and you know the
 

275
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,070
for for the sdk and you know the
applications the users involves all

276
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
applications the users involves all
 

277
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,150
applications the users involves all
these applications that runs

278
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
these applications that runs
 

279
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,150
these applications that runs
and serves like tens of thousands of

280
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
and serves like tens of thousands of
 

281
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,070
and serves like tens of thousands of
users currently

282
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
users currently
 

283
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,309
users currently
and you cannot just go lightly about

284
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
and you cannot just go lightly about
 

285
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,710
and you cannot just go lightly about
that because of the like you know

286
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
that because of the like you know
 

287
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,189
that because of the like you know
user experience should not be

288
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
user experience should not be
 

289
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,950
user experience should not be
such that you open applications suddenly

290
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
such that you open applications suddenly
 

291
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,469
such that you open applications suddenly
stop working

292
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
stop working
 

293
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,350
stop working
so um yeah so

294
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
so um yeah so
 

295
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,710
so um yeah so
it will take

296
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
it will take
 

297
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,430
it will take
a little bit more time i'm not sure how

298
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
a little bit more time i'm not sure how
 

299
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,870
a little bit more time i'm not sure how
much

300
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
much
 

301
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,830
much
um

302
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840
um
 

303
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,029
um
hopefully

304
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
hopefully
 

305
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,350
hopefully
maybe this week

306
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
maybe this week
 

307
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,270
maybe this week
if not next week but

308
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280
if not next week but
 

309
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,270
if not next week but
working hard on that

310
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
working hard on that
 

311
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,150
working hard on that
um

312
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
um
 

313
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,590
um
it was to all test that like all the

314
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
it was to all test that like all the
 

315
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,350
it was to all test that like all the
changes that we wanted we all did it

316
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
changes that we wanted we all did it
 

317
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,510
changes that we wanted we all did it
like what's all chat tested the new

318
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
like what's all chat tested the new
 

319
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,469
like what's all chat tested the new
instructions there are five of them

320
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
instructions there are five of them
 

321
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,150
instructions there are five of them
five or six of them

322
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
five or six of them
 

323
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,590
five or six of them
they're all working they're all have

324
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600
they're all working they're all have
 

325
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,270
they're all working they're all have
been forwardly tested there are some

326
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
been forwardly tested there are some
 

327
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,749
been forwardly tested there are some
upgrades that um

328
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
upgrades that um
 

329
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,430
upgrades that um
apart from that that's also are

330
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,440
apart from that that's also are
 

331
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,749
apart from that that's also are
important to create security upgrades

332
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
important to create security upgrades
 

333
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,749
important to create security upgrades
but um

334
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
but um
 

335
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,430
but um
so this is the status

336
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
so this is the status
 

337
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,430
so this is the status
currently

338
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
currently
 

339
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,469
currently
about that

340
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
about that
 

341
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,710
about that
um it's not that critical but

342
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:04,720
um it's not that critical but
 

343
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,670
um it's not that critical but
still

344
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
still
 

345
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,070
still
so the another thing is that

346
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
so the another thing is that
 

347
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,790
so the another thing is that
um i think

348
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
um i think
 

349
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,790
um i think

well while obviously

408
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
well while obviously
 

409
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,270
well while obviously
this is just um

410
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
this is just um
 

411
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,230
this is just um
just things that probably i said and and

412
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
just things that probably i said and and
 

413
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,749
just things that probably i said and and
um

414
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
um
 

415
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,830
um
you know instead of when you put a

416
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
you know instead of when you put a
 

417
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,350
you know instead of when you put a
roadmap right you cannot put soon there

418
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
roadmap right you cannot put soon there
 

419
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,909
roadmap right you cannot put soon there
that's really unfortunate

420
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
that's really unfortunate
 

421
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,269
that's really unfortunate
so i think they just they just

422
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
so i think they just they just
 

423
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,029
so i think they just they just
multiplied whatever i said by by a

424
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
multiplied whatever i said by by a
 

425
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,709
multiplied whatever i said by by a
factor of three

426
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
factor of three
 

427
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,589
factor of three
um

428
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
um
 

429
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,670
um
and you know if you want to give a

430
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
and you know if you want to give a
 

431
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,509
and you know if you want to give a
commitment then that's probably what you

432
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
commitment then that's probably what you
 

433
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,509
commitment then that's probably what you
need to do and that's the problem with

434
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
need to do and that's the problem with
 

435
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,190
need to do and that's the problem with
dates and the road maps right because

436
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
dates and the road maps right because
 

437
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,949
dates and the road maps right because
you as i'm telling you right now nobody

438
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
you as i'm telling you right now nobody
 

439
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,949
you as i'm telling you right now nobody
simply nobody

440
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:56,959
simply nobody
 

441
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,030
simply nobody
the hell knows when these things will be

442
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
the hell knows when these things will be
 

443
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,670
the hell knows when these things will be
delivered okay this is a true state of

444
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
delivered okay this is a true state of
 

445
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,990
delivered okay this is a true state of
the development of anything which is a

446
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
the development of anything which is a
 

447
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,150
the development of anything which is a
little bit more complicated than

448
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
little bit more complicated than
 

449
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,269
little bit more complicated than
you know

450
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279
you know
 

451
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,550
you know
than three

452
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
than three
 

453
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,829
than three
lines of code

454
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
lines of code
 

455
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,990
lines of code
so um

456
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000
so um
 

457
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,269
so um
but in

458
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:13,279
but in
 

459
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,509
but in
like so there are no

460
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
like so there are no
 

461
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,750
like so there are no
real dates

462
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
real dates
 

463
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,070
real dates
but um when you

464
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
but um when you
 

465
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,389
but um when you
press to make an assumption then the

466
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:22,399
press to make an assumption then the
 

467
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,190
press to make an assumption then the
best strategy you could uh

468
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
best strategy you could uh
 

469
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,829
best strategy you could uh
you know choose in order not to be

470
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
you know choose in order not to be
 

471
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,310
you know choose in order not to be
hold accountable is just to multiply

472
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
hold accountable is just to multiply
 

473
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,990
hold accountable is just to multiply
everything you say by some factor of

474
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,000
everything you say by some factor of
 

475
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,030
everything you say by some factor of
whatever

476
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
whatever
 

477
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,790
whatever
you choose the factor

478
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
you choose the factor
 

479
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,590
you choose the factor
right three four five whatever so that's

480
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
right three four five whatever so that's
 

481
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,110
right three four five whatever so that's
what you see here more or less

482
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
what you see here more or less
 

483
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,150
what you see here more or less
and uh the things that are in delivery

484
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
and uh the things that are in delivery
 

485
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,230
and uh the things that are in delivery
in q1

486
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
in q1
 

487
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,230
in q1
is like something that has already been

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
is like something that has already been
 

489
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,550
is like something that has already been
done more or less

490
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
done more or less
 

491
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,630
done more or less
i think well at least i'm talking about

i think well at least i'm talking about
 

493
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,350
i think well at least i'm talking about
our our stuff like whatever

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,550
states q3
so that's one thing um

524
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,560
so that's one thing um
 

525
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,110
so that's one thing um
i wanted to say

526
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
i wanted to say
 

527
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,910
i wanted to say
another thing is um that so

528
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
another thing is um that so
 

529
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,990
another thing is um that so
like bottom line many of the things that

530
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
like bottom line many of the things that
 

531
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,750
like bottom line many of the things that
are that are

532
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
are that are
 

533
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,710
are that are
uh stated here will come much sooner

534
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,720
uh stated here will come much sooner
 

535
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,190
uh stated here will come much sooner
than it is stated here but for the for

536
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
than it is stated here but for the for
 

537
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,269
than it is stated here but for the for
the for the safety of the kind of road

538
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279
the for the safety of the kind of road
 

539
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,230
the for the safety of the kind of road
map

540
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
map
 

541
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,550
map
they're they're just there's even more

542
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
they're they're just there's even more
 

543
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,230
they're they're just there's even more
time

544
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
time
 

545
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,430
time
right

546
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
right
 

547
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,230
right
um

548
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
um
 

549
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,509
um
okay so um i just want to comment on few

550
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
okay so um i just want to comment on few
 

551
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,030
okay so um i just want to comment on few
things the

552
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
things the
 

553
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,470
things the
um

554
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:57,480
um
 

555
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,030
um

the decrease in gas

558
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
the decrease in gas
 

559
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,230
the decrease in gas
that it says up to 100 x there will be a

560
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
that it says up to 100 x there will be a
 

561
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,790
that it says up to 100 x there will be a
decrease of gas that's for sure this

562
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
decrease of gas that's for sure this
 

563
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,110
decrease of gas that's for sure this
quarter i'm not sure it will be i'm sure

564
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
quarter i'm not sure it will be i'm sure
 

565
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,110
quarter i'm not sure it will be i'm sure
it won't be 100 x

566
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,120
it won't be 100 x
 

567
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,790
it won't be 100 x
and uh the reason for that is

568
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
and uh the reason for that is
 

569
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,030
and uh the reason for that is
because you need a whole other range of

570
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
because you need a whole other range of
 

571
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,470
because you need a whole other range of
technologies

572
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
technologies
 

573
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,190
technologies
to

574
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
to
 

575
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,509
to
support economically the scalability of

576
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
support economically the scalability of
 

577
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,230
support economically the scalability of
the system

578
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240

 

579
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,150

so um

580
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
so um
 

581
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,030
so um
so

582
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
so
 

583
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,110
so
in order to do that you need really the

584
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
in order to do that you need really the
 

585
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,550
in order to do that you need really the
dynamic gas season which is listed in q3

586
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,560
dynamic gas season which is listed in q3
 

587
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,230
dynamic gas season which is listed in q3
um

588
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
um
 

589
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,829
um
because you cannot because without that

590
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
because you cannot because without that
 

591
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,590
because you cannot because without that
you cannot start new work chain and

592
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
you cannot start new work chain and
 

593
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,670
you cannot start new work chain and
without starting a new work chain

594
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
without starting a new work chain
 

595
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,509
without starting a new work chain
you anyway there is a limit of

596
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
you anyway there is a limit of
 

597
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,350
you anyway there is a limit of
scalability in one word chain anyway

598
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
scalability in one word chain anyway
 

599
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,430
scalability in one word chain anyway
right there just physical limit of the

600
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
right there just physical limit of the
 

601
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,030
right there just physical limit of the
of the blocks that you can transmit over

602
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
of the blocks that you can transmit over
 

603
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,630
of the blocks that you can transmit over
the network currently

604
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,640
the network currently
 

605
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,550
the network currently
and so

606
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
and so
 

607
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,629
and so
if you make it hundred x smaller the

608
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
if you make it hundred x smaller the
 

609
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,870
if you make it hundred x smaller the
fees you will end up

610
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
fees you will end up
 

611
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,949
fees you will end up
in salon a situation

612
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
in salon a situation
 

613
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,030
in salon a situation
um of course not exactly in salon

614
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040
um of course not exactly in salon
 

615
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,030
um of course not exactly in salon
situation because i think we can sustain

616
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,040
situation because i think we can sustain
 

617
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,910
situation because i think we can sustain
like more gps on one work chain

618
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
like more gps on one work chain
 

619
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,069
like more gps on one work chain
but still it is very close to salon

620
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
but still it is very close to salon
 

621
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,790
but still it is very close to salon
situation where it costs nothing to to

622
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:08,800
situation where it costs nothing to to
 

623
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,629
situation where it costs nothing to to
spam the network and if it costs nothing

624
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
spam the network and if it costs nothing
 

625
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,150
spam the network and if it costs nothing
to spawn the network someone will come

626
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
to spawn the network someone will come
 

627
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,470
to spawn the network someone will come
and spam the network

628
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
and spam the network
 

629
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,430
and spam the network
all right

630
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
all right
 

631
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,910
all right
so you need it in dynamic svs so there

632
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
so you need it in dynamic svs so there
 

633
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,150
so you need it in dynamic svs so there
is a trade of somewhere so the gas fees

634
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,160
is a trade of somewhere so the gas fees
 

635
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,670
is a trade of somewhere so the gas fees
will decrease but not by not by 100 100

636
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
will decrease but not by not by 100 100
 

637
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,110
will decrease but not by not by 100 100
ticks

638
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
ticks
 

639
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,870
ticks
i mean that's one thing

640
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:26,880
i mean that's one thing
 

641
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,710
i mean that's one thing
um then

642
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720
um then
 

643
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,069
um then
like um

644
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:32,079

 

645
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,150

then there are some other things that i

646
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,160
then there are some other things that i
 

647
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,910
then there are some other things that i
want to mention for example there's new

648
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
want to mention for example there's new
 

649
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,269
want to mention for example there's new
things that you see and they got the

650
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:37,279
things that you see and they got the
 

651
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,350
things that you see and they got the
questions about that so there's a gauche

652
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
questions about that so there's a gauche
 

653
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,590
questions about that so there's a gauche
git on chain source holder

in the plan or is already been developed
 

695
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,230
in the plan or is already been developed
so it will be developed fully because we

696
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
so it will be developed fully because we
 

697
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,550
so it will be developed fully because we
don't have currently no we i don't have

and uh need to be done
 

707
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,949
and uh need to be done
um so and that's really for for us the

708
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:40,959
um so and that's really for for us the
 

709
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,790
um so and that's really for for us the
road map there is nothing new in terms

uh operating system there is there is
 

715
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,150
uh operating system there is there is
nothing new that um maybe some things

716
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
nothing new that um maybe some things
 

717
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,069
nothing new that um maybe some things
are actually missing in this roadmap

718
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:52,079
are actually missing in this roadmap
 

719
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,509
are actually missing in this roadmap
that we are going to do

that we are going to do
 

721
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,350
that we are going to do
but because their roadmap shouldn't be

00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
but because their roadmap shouldn't be
 

723
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,829
but because their roadmap shouldn't be

what the the repositories the
 

765
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,189
what the the repositories the
centralized repositories they all they

766
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
centralized repositories they all they
 

767
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,590
centralized repositories they all they
always have one

768
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600

a single person who owns them and and
 

773
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,750
a single person who owns them and and
that is that is a huge problem in the

774
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
that is that is a huge problem in the
 

775
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,910
that is that is a huge problem in the
decentralized world of course so we need

776
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920
decentralized world of course so we need
 

777
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,269
decentralized world of course so we need
to fix that and and several other things

778
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
to fix that and and several other things
 

779
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,189
to fix that and and several other things
so we're working on that

780
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
so we're working on that
 

781
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,230
so we're working on that
we hope to show demos sometimes in may

782
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,240
we hope to show demos sometimes in may
 

783
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,389
we hope to show demos sometimes in may
so yeah so that's um that's the

784
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:04,399
so yeah so that's um that's the
 

785
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,110
so yeah so that's um that's the
questions that i got about this ones

786
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
questions that i got about this ones
 

787
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,790
questions that i got about this ones
um

788

there are other questions i think that
 

791
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,910
there are other questions i think that
ron would put

yeah i did you can answer them now
at the end of the call oh yeah i'm

798
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:18,880
at the end of the call oh yeah i'm
 

799
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,110
at the end of the call oh yeah i'm
already talking about about the roadmap

800
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
already talking about about the roadmap
 

801
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,550
already talking about about the roadmap
so can you use drivechain as database

802
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
so can you use drivechain as database
 

803
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,389
so can you use drivechain as database
no you can use blockchain as a database

804
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
no you can use blockchain as a database
 

805
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,310
no you can use blockchain as a database
drive chain is for storage like it's

806
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
drive chain is for storage like it's
 

807
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,189
drive chain is for storage like it's
it's storage so drive chain is listed in

808
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:31,199
it's storage so drive chain is listed in
 

809
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,110
it's storage so drive chain is listed in
q4 and actually and in fact i think this

810
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,120
q4 and actually and in fact i think this
 

811
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,710
q4 and actually and in fact i think this
is correct timing

812
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
is correct timing
 

813
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,470
is correct timing
because drive chain is is

814
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,480
because drive chain is is
 

815
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,230
because drive chain is is
not yet been implemented but of course

816
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
not yet been implemented but of course
 

817
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,949
not yet been implemented but of course
we are definitely planning to do that

818

okay ivan you have a question

908
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:29,520

 

909
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,789

isn't it necessary to have drive chain

910
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
isn't it necessary to have drive chain
 

911
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,470
isn't it necessary to have drive chain
uh running

912
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,480
uh running
 

913
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,190
uh running
for doing the this gauche

914
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,200
for doing the this gauche
 

915
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,230
for doing the this gauche
stuff or dry chain is not needed here

916
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240
stuff or dry chain is not needed here
 

917
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,909
stuff or dry chain is not needed here
why is it earlier than drive

918
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919

 

919
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,669

drive chain is not necessary drive chain

920
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:45,679
drive chain is not necessary drive chain
 

921
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,669
drive chain is not necessary drive chain
is only necessary for storing binaries

922
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:47,679
is only necessary for storing binaries
 

923
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,029
is only necessary for storing binaries
yeah i know a lot of people storing

924
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:49,039
yeah i know a lot of people storing
 

925
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,870
yeah i know a lot of people storing
binaries in git git

926
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
binaries in git git
 

927
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,669
binaries in git git
but git is not built for that in general

928
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:53,679
but git is not built for that in general
 

929
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,350
but git is not built for that in general
you can do that because like you can

930
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360
you can do that because like you can
 

931
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,350
you can do that because like you can
store everything anywhere and you can

932
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
store everything anywhere and you can
 

933
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,590
store everything anywhere and you can
store files and file system right so

934
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,600
store files and file system right so
 

935
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,750
store files and file system right so
yeah so in order to store binaries you

936
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:01,760
yeah so in order to store binaries you
 

937
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,590
yeah so in order to store binaries you
will need to drive chain and we are

938
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600
will need to drive chain and we are
 

939
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,750
will need to drive chain and we are
going to enable the storage of the

940
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
going to enable the storage of the
 

941
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,510
going to enable the storage of the
binaries in gauche but when the

942
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:07,520
binaries in gauche but when the
 

943
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,110
binaries in gauche but when the
direction will be ready beforehand you

944
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
direction will be ready beforehand you
 

945
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,470
direction will be ready beforehand you
won't be able to store

946
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
won't be able to store
 

947
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,549
won't be able to store
binaries

948
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559
binaries
 

949
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,350
binaries
and how how do you expect the uh like

950
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:17,360
and how how do you expect the uh like
 

951
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,590
and how how do you expect the uh like
size of uh

952
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600
size of uh
 

953
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,510
size of uh
repositories for example everex

954
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:21,520

like
 

961
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,070
like
it's um

962
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,080

 

963
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,470

the gosh maybe it's not the time to talk

964
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:34,480
the gosh maybe it's not the time to talk
 

965
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,830
the gosh maybe it's not the time to talk
about that maybe we'll have another

966
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:35,840
about that maybe we'll have another
 

967
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,070
about that maybe we'll have another
session on if you want on on the

968
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,080
session on if you want on on the
 

969
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,750
session on if you want on on the
architecture of gosh

970

architecture of gosh
 

971
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,190
architecture of gosh
but uh

972
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,200
but uh
 

973
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,549
but uh
the single contract can store

974
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
the single contract can store
 

975
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,510
the single contract can store
without any problem after up to 200 2

976
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,520

without any problem after up to 200 2
500 uh

978
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
500 uh
 

979
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,029
500 uh
lines of code

980
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,039
lines of code
 

981
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,590
lines of code
around that number 3000 something

982
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:53,600
around that number 3000 something
 

983
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,870
around that number 3000 something
because it's compressed so um so because

984
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880
because it's compressed so um so because
 

985
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,470
because it's compressed so um so because
we don't see this

986
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
we don't see this
 

987
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,630
we don't see this
like these rarely see files which are

988
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,640
like these rarely see files which are
 

989
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,990
like these rarely see files which are
more than that

990
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,000
more than that
 

991
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,710
more than that
you can usually store them in just one

992
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:04,720
you can usually store them in just one
 

993
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,789
you can usually store them in just one
basically message

994
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:06,799
basically message
 

995
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,510
basically message
so

996
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
so
 

997
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,669
so
we don't we don't see any problems

998
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:09,679
we don't we don't see any problems
 

999
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,590
we don't we don't see any problems
actually one contract can accumulate

1000
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
actually one contract can accumulate
 

1001
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,669
actually one contract can accumulate
more than that but yeah no but several

1002
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:13,679
more than that but yeah no but several
 

1003
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,230
more than that but yeah no but several

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,070
um
the three

1204
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,080
the three
 

1205
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,549
the three
the three uh products that

1206
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:54,559
the three uh products that
 

1207
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,669
the three uh products that
um

1208
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:55,679
um
 

1209
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,029
um
that uh that we have uh currently

1210
00:22:59,029 --> 00:22:59,039
that uh that we have uh currently
 

1211
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,390
that uh that we have uh currently
uh got as as the three winners are

1212
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:02,400
uh got as as the three winners are
 

1213
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,510
uh got as as the three winners are
uh convo space

1214
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,520
uh convo space
 

1215
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,830
uh convo space
which is

1216
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:06,840
which is
 

1217
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,470
which is
a social app that

1218
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:10,480
a social app that
 

1219
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,990
a social app that
is actually cross-chained so it

1220
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
is actually cross-chained so it
 

1221
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,430
is actually cross-chained so it
integrates into several other

1222
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,440
integrates into several other
 

1223
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,029
integrates into several other
blockchains as well

1224
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:15,039
blockchains as well
 

1225
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,110
blockchains as well
and that

1226
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,120

 

1227
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,230

that allows you to have all your

1228
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,240
that allows you to have all your
 

1229
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,710
that allows you to have all your
conversations in one place with one line

1230
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:22,720
conversations in one place with one line
 

1231
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,230
conversations in one place with one line
of code

1232
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,240
of code
 

1233
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,789
of code
um so that was pretty cool and the other

1234
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:26,799
um so that was pretty cool and the other
 

1235
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,950
um so that was pretty cool and the other
two let me just

1236
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:28,960
two let me just
 

1237
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,390
two let me just
see the names

1238
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:32,400

 

1239
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,750

um the other two are

1240
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,760
um the other two are
 

1241
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,510
um the other two are
dream base

1242
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
dream base
 

1243
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,350
dream base
which uh is a

1244
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,360
which uh is a
 

1245
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,549
which uh is a
nft

1246
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559
nft
 

1247
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,390
nft
or actually dream base is a

1248
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:46,400
or actually dream base is a
 

1249
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,909
or actually dream base is a
platform focused on the africa audience

1250
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:49,919
platform focused on the africa audience
 

1251
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,669
platform focused on the africa audience
to be able to

1252
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:53,679

 

1253
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,110

have

1254
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,120
have
 

1255
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,750
have
a community and an nft ecosystem around

1256
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
a community and an nft ecosystem around
 

1257
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,390
a community and an nft ecosystem around
music and around writing

1258
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,400
music and around writing
 

1259
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,350
music and around writing
so

1260
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,360
so
 

1261
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,870
so
any

1262
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:02,880
any
 

1263
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,430
any
writing can actually be

1264
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,440
writing can actually be
 

1265
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,909
writing can actually be
uh minted as an nft

1266
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:07,919
uh minted as an nft
 

1267
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,510
uh minted as an nft
on the platform

1268
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,520
on the platform
 

1269
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,549
on the platform
um

1270
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:10,559
um
 

1271
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,750
um
i thought it was pretty cool and then

1272
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:11,760
i thought it was pretty cool and then
 

1273
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,350
i thought it was pretty cool and then

1281
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,310

all three of these projects actually

1282
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,320
all three of these projects actually
 

1283
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,430
all three of these projects actually
have

1284
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:25,440
have
 

1285
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,230
have
quite

1286
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,240
quite
 

1287
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,710
quite
quite built out

1288

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,110
quite built out
teams and technology so

1290
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,120
teams and technology so
 

1291
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,830
teams and technology so
um i think that it's it's quite possible

1292
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:33,840
um i think that it's it's quite possible
 

1293
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,390
um i think that it's it's quite possible
that they continue

1294
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:36,400
that they continue
 

1295
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,390
that they continue
um and what i would suggest as a

1296
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:38,400
um and what i would suggest as a
 

1297
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,830
um and what i would suggest as a
follow-up to

1298
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:39,840
follow-up to
 

1299
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,870

competition
 

1303
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,990
competition
is

1304
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,000
is
 

1305
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,870
is
um is us linking this to a

1306
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:46,880
um is us linking this to a
 

1307
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,350
um is us linking this to a
um ever scale accelerator that can

1308
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,360
um ever scale accelerator that can
 

1309
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,390
um ever scale accelerator that can
perhaps

1310
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,400
perhaps
 

1311
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,630
perhaps
um work with these

1312
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:52,640
um work with these
 

1313
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,870
um work with these
uh with not necessarily all of them but

1314
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:54,880
uh with not necessarily all of them but
 

1315
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,110
uh with not necessarily all of them but
work with some of the groups that we

1316
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,120
work with some of the groups that we
 

1317
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,710
work with some of the groups that we
think

1318
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:58,720
think
 

1319
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,590
think
um

1320
00:24:59,590 --> 00:24:59,600
um
 

1321
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,669
um
are marketable and that we can we can

1322
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:01,679
are marketable and that we can we can
 

1323
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,269
are marketable and that we can we can
scale

1324
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:03,279
scale
 

1325
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,510
scale
to get to the point where they they're

1326
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:05,520
to get to the point where they they're
 

1327
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,669
to get to the point where they they're
able to you know close their seed series

1328
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:07,679
able to you know close their seed series
 

1329
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,390
able to you know close their seed series
a rounds and and become marketable

1330
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:10,400
a rounds and and become marketable
 

1331
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,630
a rounds and and become marketable
um and i think that would also result in

1332
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:12,640
um and i think that would also result in
 

1333
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,630
um and i think that would also result in
quite a lot of

1334
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
quite a lot of
 

1335
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,750
quite a lot of
of publicity if we introduce a kind of

1336
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:17,760
of publicity if we introduce a kind of
 

1337
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,310
of publicity if we introduce a kind of
early stage accelerator to

1338
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:20,320
early stage accelerator to
 

1339
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,870
early stage accelerator to
uh ever scale accelerator to markets and

1340
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:22,880
uh ever scale accelerator to markets and
 

1341
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,750
uh ever scale accelerator to markets and
then that some of these teams start to

1342
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:25,760
then that some of these teams start to
 

1343
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,070
then that some of these teams start to
start to enter the accelerator

1344
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,080
start to enter the accelerator
 

1345
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,350
start to enter the accelerator
i think it would also present a way to

1346
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,360
i think it would also present a way to
 

1347
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,750
i think it would also present a way to
generate some cash flows

1348
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:33,760
generate some cash flows
 

1349
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,750
generate some cash flows
that could be reinvested into

1350
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:35,760
that could be reinvested into
 

1351
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,310
that could be reinvested into
into the network and that kind of ties

1352
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,320
into the network and that kind of ties
 

1353
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,710
into the network and that kind of ties
into the crystal handshake

1354
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:40,720
into the crystal handshake
 

1355
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,470
into the crystal handshake
program that is

1356
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:42,480
program that is
 

1357
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,789
program that is
um for more established businesses i

1358
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:44,799
um for more established businesses i
 

1359
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,909
um for more established businesses i
think this this uh like a an early stage

1360
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:47,919
think this this uh like a an early stage
 

1361
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,269
think this this uh like a an early stage
accelerator kind of fills the gap in

1362
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:51,279
accelerator kind of fills the gap in
 

1363
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,550
accelerator kind of fills the gap in
um in getting projects from

1364
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:53,560
um in getting projects from
 

1365
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,430
um in getting projects from

um

1372
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:01,760
um
 

1373
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,350
um
that you know a three-month program kind

1374
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,360
that you know a three-month program kind
 

1375
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,990
that you know a three-month program kind
of thing five-month program where

1376
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,000
of thing five-month program where
 

1377
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,390
of thing five-month program where
um it's an accelerated way for them to

1378
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:08,400
um it's an accelerated way for them to
 

1379
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,390
um it's an accelerated way for them to
raise their first you know one to five

1380
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:10,400
raise their first you know one to five
 

1381
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,310
raise their first you know one to five
million bucks and then

1382
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,320
million bucks and then
 

1383
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,149
million bucks and then
uh and then to

1384
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:14,159
uh and then to
 

1385
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,950
uh and then to
to be able to deploy that further into

1386
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:16,960
to be able to deploy that further into
 

1387
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,950
to be able to deploy that further into
uh into scaling to get to the point

1388
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:18,960
uh into scaling to get to the point
 

1389
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,149
uh into scaling to get to the point
where they can access the crystal

1390
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:20,159
where they can access the crystal
 

1391
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,070
where they can access the crystal
handshake program so that's that's one

1392
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,080
handshake program so that's that's one
 

1393
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,750
handshake program so that's that's one
suggestion that i have to move forward

1394
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:25,760
suggestion that i have to move forward
 

1395
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,630
suggestion that i have to move forward
uh in addition i think that uh whether

1396
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:28,640
uh in addition i think that uh whether
 

1397
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,549
uh in addition i think that uh whether
we do an accelerator or not and i'm

1398
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:30,559
we do an accelerator or not and i'm
 

1399
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,230
we do an accelerator or not and i'm
happy to uh to hear all of your

1400
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:32,240
happy to uh to hear all of your
 

1401
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,390
happy to uh to hear all of your
feedbacks and i'm also happy to kind of

1402
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:34,400
feedbacks and i'm also happy to kind of
 

1403
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,870
feedbacks and i'm also happy to kind of
champion the putting together of it

1404
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:36,880
champion the putting together of it
 

1405
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,669
champion the putting together of it
um i think that it might be worthwhile

1406
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:39,679
um i think that it might be worthwhile
 

1407
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,750
um i think that it might be worthwhile
for us to

1408
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:41,760
for us to
 

1409
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,510
for us to
follow up with

1410
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:43,520
follow up with
 

1411
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,549
follow up with
um

1412
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:44,559
um
 

1413
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,430
um
any of the relevant teams that

1414
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:47,440
any of the relevant teams that
 

1415
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,669
any of the relevant teams that
are building on everscale so that

1416
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679
are building on everscale so that
 

1417
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,430
are building on everscale so that
ideally

1418
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:51,440
ideally
 

1419
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,909
ideally
whether we are like formally working

1420
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:53,919
whether we are like formally working
 

1421
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,590
whether we are like formally working
with them in an accelerated capacity or

1422
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:55,600
with them in an accelerated capacity or
 

1423
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,430
with them in an accelerated capacity or
not i think it's in our best interest

1424
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:57,440
not i think it's in our best interest
 

1425
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,950
not i think it's in our best interest
for

1426
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:58,960
for
 

1427
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,510
for
as many of them as possible to come to

1428
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,520
as many of them as possible to come to
 

1429
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,430
as many of them as possible to come to
like introduce to the market

1430
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:03,440
like introduce to the market
 

1431
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,630
like introduce to the market
their um

1432
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:06,640
their um
 

1433
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,710
their um
uh like you know that they have that

1434
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:08,720
uh like you know that they have that
 

1435
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,269
uh like you know that they have that
they're building on everscale and why

1436
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:11,279
they're building on everscale and why
 

1437
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,269
they're building on everscale and why
um i think also be great if

1438
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279
um i think also be great if
 

1439
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,510
um i think also be great if
if we can kind of leverage this to

1440
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:17,520
if we can kind of leverage this to
 

1441
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,350
if we can kind of leverage this to
expand the number of nodes

1442
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
expand the number of nodes
 

1443
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,950
expand the number of nodes
um so those are kind of thoughts on on

1444
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:22,960
um so those are kind of thoughts on on
 

1445
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,990
um so those are kind of thoughts on on
what i would what i would do with the

1446
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,000
what i would what i would do with the
 

1447
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,830
what i would what i would do with the
um with these now like 275 people that

in more or less capacity in the

1460
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:38,640
in more or less capacity in the
 

1461
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,310
in more or less capacity in the
everscale ecosystem

1462
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:40,320
everscale ecosystem
 

1463
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,310
everscale ecosystem
and to continue to bring them in further

1464
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,320

 

1465
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,190

1471
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,029
uh views on the website the top 10
startup website which i think is pretty

1472
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:55,039
startup website which i think is pretty
 

1473
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,510
startup website which i think is pretty
good with with no paid ads just uh just

1474
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:57,520
good with with no paid ads just uh just

i actually had a question for you is it
possible to get uh one or all of these

1510
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:37,760
possible to get uh one or all of these
 

1511
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,870
possible to get uh one or all of these
folks maybe

1512
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:38,880
folks maybe
 

1513
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,750
folks maybe
to come on next tuesday's call

1514
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:41,760

for
for all of them it'll give us a good

1522
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:48,159
for all of them it'll give us a good
 

1523
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,990
for all of them it'll give us a good
indicator especially the three winners i

1524
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,000
indicator especially the three winners i
 

1525
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,549
indicator especially the three winners i
think for sure um i think it'll give us

1526
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:52,559
think for sure um i think it'll give us
 

1527
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,830
think for sure um i think it'll give us
a good indicator of whether there are

1528
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:53,840
a good indicator of whether there are
 

1529
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,630
a good indicator of whether there are
serious projects that want to continue

1530
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:56,640
serious projects that want to continue
 

1531
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,470
serious projects that want to continue
uh if they are you know if they i mean

1532
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:58,480
uh if they are you know if they i mean
 

1533
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,909
uh if they are you know if they i mean
if they are open to coming and

1534
00:28:59,909 --> 00:28:59,919
if they are open to coming and
 

1535
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,789
if they are open to coming and
presenting then that is

1536
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:02,799
presenting then that is
 

1537
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,029
presenting then that is
a level of additional credibility that

1538
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:05,039
a level of additional credibility that
 

1539
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,149
a level of additional credibility that
you know they're serious and that we

1540
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:06,159
you know they're serious and that we
 

1541
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,909
you know they're serious and that we
should invest more time into them so

1542
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:07,919
should invest more time into them so

an enormous return on investment
um for for the network in in the sense

1780

uh on the table
 

1787
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,509
uh on the table
uh and it results in

1788
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:45,519
uh and it results in
 

1789
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,509
uh and it results in
uh in a market cap increase that is

1790
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:47,519
uh in a market cap increase that is
 

1791

significantly larger than the amount of
 

1793
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,950
significantly larger than the amount of
cash that was put on the table so it

1794
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:50,960
cash that was put on the table so it
 

1795
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,110
cash that was put on the table so it
kind of becomes free

1796
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,120
kind of becomes free
 

1797
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,070
kind of becomes free
um and just to go back for a sec these

um thanks thanks for watching that and
just before we move on um one i wonder

2222
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:27,440
just before we move on um one i wonder
 

2223
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,230
just before we move on um one i wonder
whether you have any any ideas about uh

2224
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,240
whether you have any any ideas about uh
 

2225
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,550
whether you have any any ideas about uh
synergies with the metaverse group or uh

2226
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:32,560
synergies with the metaverse group or uh
 

2227
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,150
synergies with the metaverse group or uh
or perhaps we could take it offline if

2228
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,160
or perhaps we could take it offline if
 

2229
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,190
or perhaps we could take it offline if
uh if you'd like to brainstorm together

2230
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:37,200
uh if you'd like to brainstorm together
 

2231
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,790
uh if you'd like to brainstorm together
yeah i think yeah but let's let's take

2232
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:38,800
yeah i think yeah but let's let's take
 

2233
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,670
yeah i think yeah but let's let's take
it offline um uh let's let's connect and

2234
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:41,680
it offline um uh let's let's connect and
 

2235
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,190
it offline um uh let's let's connect and
uh i think there are several people that

2236
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:43,200
uh i think there are several people that
 

2237
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,030
uh i think there are several people that
we can uh actually uh form a group

2238
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,040
we can uh actually uh form a group
 

2239
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,630
we can uh actually uh form a group
around and uh who have very good ideas

2240
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:50,640

 

2241
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,670

we also we also just for uh for context

number a number
uh yeah so let me maybe uh take it from

2306
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:10,079
uh yeah so let me maybe uh take it from
 

2307
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:10,790
uh yeah so let me maybe uh take it from
from

2308
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:10,800
from
 

2309
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,710
from
on the scale roadmap here so um

2310
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:14,720
on the scale roadmap here so um
 

2311
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,660
on the scale roadmap here so um
just let me share it

2312
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:18,670

 

2313
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,470

[Music]

2314
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:20,480
[Music]
 

2315
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,230
[Music]
yeah yeah so a few questions also

2316
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:24,240
yeah yeah so a few questions also
 

2317
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,470
yeah yeah so a few questions also
concerning the development of different

2318
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:26,480
concerning the development of different
 

2319
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,870
concerning the development of different
sections and how the the roadmap was

2320
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:28,880
sections and how the the roadmap was
 

2321
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,750
sections and how the the roadmap was
built

2322
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:29,760
built
 

2323
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,710
built
actually

2324
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:30,720
actually
 

2325
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,910
actually
so

2326
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:31,920
so
 

2327
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,069
so
it's not an easy task to build the

2328
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:34,079
it's not an easy task to build the
 

2329
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,390
it's not an easy task to build the
roadmap of a decentralized network

2330
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:36,400
roadmap of a decentralized network
 

2331
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,069
roadmap of a decentralized network
because

2332
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:38,079
because
 

2333
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,309
because
you need to talk to a lot of people uh

2334
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:40,319
you need to talk to a lot of people uh
 

2335
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,190
you need to talk to a lot of people uh
from different uh

2336
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:43,200
from different uh
 

2337
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,030
from different uh
well sub governance is here but

2338
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,040
well sub governance is here but
 

2339
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,190
well sub governance is here but
community sub communities

2340
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:47,200
community sub communities
 

2341
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,270
community sub communities
i don't know what world is not uh

2342
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:49,280
i don't know what world is not uh
 

2343
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,710
i don't know what world is not uh
prohibited now

2344
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:50,720
prohibited now
 

2345
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,510
prohibited now
you know scale i don't know i don't know

2346
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:53,520
you know scale i don't know i don't know
 

2347
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,510
you know scale i don't know i don't know
yes uh yes uh so what we did actually we

2348
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:57,520
yes uh yes uh so what we did actually we
 

2349
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,510
yes uh yes uh so what we did actually we
talked to a lot of people and

2350
00:43:59,510 --> 00:43:59,520
talked to a lot of people and
 

2351
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,589
talked to a lot of people and
gathered together the vision

2352
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:01,599
gathered together the vision
 

2353
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,750
gathered together the vision
of the development of

2354
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:03,760
of the development of
 

2355
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,750
of the development of
uh different streams

2356
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:05,760
uh different streams
 

2357
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,589
uh different streams
in every scale

2358
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:07,599
in every scale
 

2359
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,710
in every scale
the terms uh are approximate as media

2360
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:10,720
the terms uh are approximate as media
 

2361
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,430
the terms uh are approximate as media
said so you cannot just

2362
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:13,440
said so you cannot just
 

2363
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,510
said so you cannot just
make it for sure so when

2364
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:15,520
make it for sure so when
 

2365
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,270
make it for sure so when
typically in

2366
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:17,280
typically in
 

2367
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,349
typically in
i.t development and specifically in the

2368
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:19,359
i.t development and specifically in the
 

2369
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,950
i.t development and specifically in the
blockchain development

2370
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:20,960
blockchain development
 

2371
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,109
blockchain development
it's it doesn't work like this so if you

2372
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:23,119
it's it doesn't work like this so if you
 

2373
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,349
it's it doesn't work like this so if you
can't do it faster you typically don't

2374
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:25,359
can't do it faster you typically don't
 

2375
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,150
can't do it faster you typically don't
wait and do it faster but uh

2376
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:28,160
wait and do it faster but uh
 

2377
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,950
wait and do it faster but uh
it

2378
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:28,960
it
 

2379
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,829
it
sometimes it happens that the deadlines

2380
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:31,839
sometimes it happens that the deadlines
 

2381
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,270
sometimes it happens that the deadlines
shifts and

2382
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:33,280
shifts and
 

2383
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,270
shifts and
that's that's always

2384
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:35,280
that's that's always
 

2385
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,630
that's that's always
worse than

2386
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:36,640
worse than
 

2387
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,670
worse than
specifying the much later deadline and

2388
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:39,680
specifying the much later deadline and
 

2389
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,069
specifying the much later deadline and
doing it faster actually

2390
00:44:42,069 --> 00:44:42,079
doing it faster actually
 

2391
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,710
doing it faster actually
uh so yeah uh this is actually the

2392
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:44,720
uh so yeah uh this is actually the
 

2393
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,550
uh so yeah uh this is actually the
direction where we

2394
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:46,560
direction where we
 

2395
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,950
direction where we
would like the everscale to go in this

2396
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:48,960
would like the everscale to go in this
 

2397
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,510
would like the everscale to go in this
year and it's it's quite a lot and

2398
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:53,520
year and it's it's quite a lot and
 

2399
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,349
year and it's it's quite a lot and
i personally know not so many uh

2400
00:44:57,349 --> 00:44:57,359
i personally know not so many uh
 

2401
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,950
i personally know not so many uh
other blockchains

2402
00:44:58,950 --> 00:44:58,960
other blockchains
 

2403
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,950
other blockchains
of our level who

2404
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:00,960
of our level who
 

2405
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,150
of our level who
have moved significantly further than us

2406
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:04,160
have moved significantly further than us
 

2407
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,150
have moved significantly further than us
and

2408
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:06,160
and
 

2409

there are not a lot of uh blockchains
 

2427
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,069
there are not a lot of uh blockchains
like ours uh but and then you can

2428

yeah i'm saying that not so many other
 

2431
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,349
yeah i'm saying that not so many other
blockchains who are

2432
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:41,359
blockchains who are
 

2433
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,430
blockchains who are
more advanced in terms of ecosystems

2434
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:43,440
more advanced in terms of ecosystems
 

2435
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,790
more advanced in terms of ecosystems
than us

2436
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:44,800
than us
 

2437
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,030
than us
and certain things that

2438
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:47,040
and certain things that
 

2439
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,230
and certain things that
will appear on our scale so

2440
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:50,240
will appear on our scale so
 

2441
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,470
will appear on our scale so
hopefully they will appear uh

2442
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:52,480
hopefully they will appear uh
 

2443
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,750
hopefully they will appear uh
first

2444
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:53,760
first
 

2445
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,510

so but

2614
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:19,599
so but
 

2615
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:20,790
so but
i'm sure

2616
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:20,800
i'm sure
 

2617
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,230
i'm sure
that

2618
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:22,240
that
 

2619
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,870
that
there is a solution and we will find it

2620
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:24,880
there is a solution and we will find it
 

2621
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,829
there is a solution and we will find it
uh speaking about uh

2622
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:27,839
uh speaking about uh

00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:33,990
announced in our roadmap
we will be adding at least three new

2628
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:34,000
we will be adding at least three new
 

2629
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,750
we will be adding at least three new
blockchains which are

2630

so and we will be doing this

2636
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:41,119
so and we will be doing this
 

2637
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,750
so and we will be doing this
hopefully really soon

2638
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:43,760
hopefully really soon
 

2639
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,589
hopefully really soon
maybe some other blockchains will also

2640
00:49:45,589 --> 00:49:45,599
maybe some other blockchains will also
 

2641
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,829
maybe some other blockchains will also
come this year

2642
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:47,839
come this year
 

2643
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,270
come this year
uh

2644
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:49,280
uh
 

2645
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,910
uh
also a good point here on is on

2646
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:51,920
also a good point here on is on
 

2647
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,790
also a good point here on is on
alliances uh like cardinal system

2648
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:54,800

alliance and texas ecosystem alliance
 

2651
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,349
alliance and texas ecosystem alliance
and maybe some other blockchains will

2652
00:49:59,349 --> 00:49:59,359
and maybe some other blockchains will
 

2653
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:00,470
and maybe some other blockchains will
also come

2654
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:00,480
also come
 

2655
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,349
also come
and

and
 

2657
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,150
and
we are now experimenting with

2658
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:04,160
we are now experimenting with
 

2659
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,150
we are now experimenting with
such

2660

such
such way of expansion of heavy scale

2662
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:09,119
such way of expansion of heavy scale
 

2663
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,309
such way of expansion of heavy scale
when we find a really strong player

2664
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:12,319
when we find a really strong player
 

2665
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,030
when we find a really strong player
in in the system of other blockchain and

2666
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:15,040
in in the system of other blockchain and
 

2667
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,870
in in the system of other blockchain and
we try to find to find the pain points

2668
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:18,880
we try to find to find the pain points
 

2669
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,589
we try to find to find the pain points
of their communities and

2670
00:50:21,589 --> 00:50:21,599
of their communities and
 

2671
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,510
of their communities and
help the communities with with other

for the moment uh one will reach from
 

2691
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,589
for the moment uh one will reach from
cardano to every scale but soon it will

2692
00:50:43,589 --> 00:50:43,599
cardano to every scale but soon it will
 

2693
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,069
cardano to every scale but soon it will
be uh bidirectional

2694
00:50:46,069 --> 00:50:46,079
be uh bidirectional
 

2695
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,190
be uh bidirectional
uh the cardano-oriented decks uh but

2696
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:49,200
uh the cardano-oriented decks uh but
 

2697
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,309
uh the cardano-oriented decks uh but
this is not not the

2698
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:52,319
this is not not the
 

2699
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,549
this is not not the
priority to have the decks for cardano

2700
00:50:54,549 --> 00:50:54,559
priority to have the decks for cardano
 

2701
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:55,589
priority to have the decks for cardano
users but

2702
00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:55,599
users but
 

2703
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,589
users but
rather this uh

2704
00:50:57,589 --> 00:50:57,599
rather this uh
 

2705
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,470
rather this uh
is an added feature so a sergey set on

2706
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:00,480
is an added feature so a sergey set on
 

2707
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,829
is an added feature so a sergey set on
the mx session

2708
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:01,839
the mx session
 

2709
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:02,870
the mx session
so and

2710
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:02,880
so and
 

2711
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,910

uh yeah so uh and also there is a very
 

2719
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,270
uh yeah so uh and also there is a very
nice point i'm really uh positive about

2720
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:15,280
nice point i'm really uh positive about
 

2721
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,990
nice point i'm really uh positive about
is a gamify and metaverse uh

2722
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:18,000
is a gamify and metaverse uh
 

2723
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,349
is a gamify and metaverse uh
stream that it's it's really

2724
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:21,359
stream that it's it's really
 

2725
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,829
stream that it's it's really
modest now so like gamify pilots and

2726
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:23,839
modest now so like gamify pilots and
 

2727
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:25,349
modest now so like gamify pilots and
metaverse sdk

2728
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:25,359
metaverse sdk
 

2729
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,190
metaverse sdk
but uh there are a lot of things

2730
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:27,200
but uh there are a lot of things
 

2731
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,790
but uh there are a lot of things
standing behind those two points and i

2732
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:28,800
standing behind those two points and i
 

2733
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,870
standing behind those two points and i
think that uh and i'm sure that we will

2734
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:30,880
think that uh and i'm sure that we will
 

2735
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,190
think that uh and i'm sure that we will
see first experiments to appear

2736
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:33,200
see first experiments to appear
 

2737
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:33,990
see first experiments to appear
uh

2738
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:34,000
uh
 

2739
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,190
uh
already

2740
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:35,200
already
 

2741
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,309
already
maybe in a month or two so when

2742
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:38,319
maybe in a month or two so when
 

2743
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,549
maybe in a month or two so when
this is just the beginning and

2744
00:51:40,549 --> 00:51:40,559
this is just the beginning and
 

2745
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,549
this is just the beginning and
more points will appear on the roadmap

2746
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:42,559
more points will appear on the roadmap
 

2747
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,230
more points will appear on the roadmap
as

2748
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:44,240
as
 

2749
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,549
as
as we move further and

as we move further and
 

2751
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,710
as we move further and
it becomes more clear and obvious what

2752
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:48,720
it becomes more clear and obvious what
 

2753
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,190
it becomes more clear and obvious what
to do um

yeah so uh this is
some some comments on the on the road

2758
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:54,880
some some comments on the on the road
 

2759
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,549
some some comments on the on the road
map um

2760
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:56,559
map um
 

2761
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,510
map um
next thing i wanted to talk about is the

2762
00:51:59,510 --> 00:51:59,520
next thing i wanted to talk about is the
 

2763
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,549
next thing i wanted to talk about is the
uh migration to a new standard of

2764
00:52:02,549 --> 00:52:02,559
uh migration to a new standard of
 

2765
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,430
uh migration to a new standard of
fungible tokens which is named tip 3.1

2766
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:07,440
fungible tokens which is named tip 3.1
 

2767
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,910
fungible tokens which is named tip 3.1
so that is happening right now so um

2768
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:11,920
so that is happening right now so um
 

2769
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,109
so that is happening right now so um
for several days already brooks team is

for several days already brooks team is
 

2771
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,309
for several days already brooks team is
migrating all its products to new token

2772
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:18,319
migrating all its products to new token
 

2773
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:19,510
migrating all its products to new token
standard

2774

standard
 

2775
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,270
standard
and uh

2776
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:21,280
and uh

especially the part concerning the
 

2781
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:27,670
especially the part concerning the
blockchain

2782
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:27,680
blockchain
 

2783
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,190

so uh now it is a
stage where we

2792
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:36,960
stage where we
 

2793
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,430
stage where we
uh upgrade our front ends and uh also

2794
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:41,440
uh upgrade our front ends and uh also
 

2795

uh so actually what's going on um so we
are testing everything so that's why we

2820
00:53:11,109 --> 00:53:11,119
are testing everything so that's why we
 

2821
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,390
are testing everything so that's why we
are not stopping

2822
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:12,400
are not stopping
 

2823
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,589
are not stopping
the farms yet so but uh definitely we

2824
00:53:15,589 --> 00:53:15,599
the farms yet so but uh definitely we
 

2825
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,589
the farms yet so but uh definitely we
will announce uh

2826

but uh this will not happen uh earlier
 

2833
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,230
but uh this will not happen uh earlier
then we have the new dex front-end

2834
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:28,240
then we have the new dex front-end
 

2835
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,589
then we have the new dex front-end
deployed

2836

let me maybe
shortly say her was about what we are

3068
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:55,599
shortly say her was about what we are
 

3069
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,230
shortly say her was about what we are
going to do in this this year so

3070
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:58,240
going to do in this this year so
 

3071
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,549
going to do in this this year so

our
 

3077
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,190
our
roadmap yes so this is the first time we

3078
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:05,200
roadmap yes so this is the first time we
 

3079
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,870
roadmap yes so this is the first time we
publicly announced it

3080
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:06,880
publicly announced it
 

3081
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,069
publicly announced it
and

3082
00:58:08,069 --> 00:58:08,079
and
 

3083
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,510
and
there are some great ideas that

3084
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:11,520
there are some great ideas that
 

3085
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,190
there are some great ideas that
we really believe

3086
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:13,200
we really believe
 

3087
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,150
we really believe
will be

3088
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:16,160

 

3089
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,990

bringing a lot of value to the whole

3090
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:18,000
bringing a lot of value to the whole
 

3091

so speaking about bridge of course

3094
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:21,359
so speaking about bridge of course
 

3095
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:25,270
so speaking about bridge of course
which is our flagship product so this uh

3096
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:25,280
which is our flagship product so this uh
 

3097
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,349
which is our flagship product so this uh
not only support of new chains and uh

3098
00:58:29,349 --> 00:58:29,359
not only support of new chains and uh
 

3099
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:31,910
not only support of new chains and uh
new tokens uh first of all we will have

3100
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:31,920
new tokens uh first of all we will have
 

3101
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,109
new tokens uh first of all we will have
the much

3102
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:33,119
the much
 

3103
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:36,390
the much
more facilitated token list mechanism

3104
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:36,400
more facilitated token list mechanism
 

3105
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,789
more facilitated token list mechanism
so we it's not in place yet but we're

3106
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:38,799
so we it's not in place yet but we're
 

3107
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,109
so we it's not in place yet but we're
only

00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,270
about this but uh definitely this year
it will appear

3114
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:47,280
it will appear
 

3115

00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:46,400
uh so and
 

3171
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,270
uh so and
once

00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:47,280
once
 

3173
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,030
once
we describe it

00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:49,040
we describe it
 

3175
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,230
we describe it
and be ready to publish so i think that

3176
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:52,240
and be ready to publish so i think that
 

3177
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,829
and be ready to publish so i think that
it deserves

3178
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:53,839
it deserves
 

3179
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:54,950
it deserves
really

3180
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:54,960
really
 

3181
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,630
really

also one one more non-trivial feature of

3186
01:00:02,309 --> 01:00:02,319
also one one more non-trivial feature of
 

3187
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,390
also one one more non-trivial feature of
the bridge is that uh

3188
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:04,400
the bridge is that uh
 

3189
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,430
the bridge is that uh
all the layers nodes uh they keep uh

3190
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:07,440
all the layers nodes uh they keep uh
 

3191
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,150
all the layers nodes uh they keep uh
they serve the well full nodes actually

3192
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:10,160
they serve the well full nodes actually
 

3193
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,670
they serve the well full nodes actually
for blockchains that are connected to

3194
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:11,680
for blockchains that are connected to
 

3195
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,589
for blockchains that are connected to
them and uh such um

3196
01:00:15,589 --> 01:00:15,599
them and uh such um
 

3197
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:16,789
them and uh such um
data set

3198
01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:16,799
data set
 

3199
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:20,710
data set
can be used to provide uh some data

3200
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:20,720
can be used to provide uh some data
 

3201
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,109
can be used to provide uh some data
to to the blockchain to any connected

3202
01:00:23,109 --> 01:00:23,119
to to the blockchain to any connected
 

3203
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,109
to to the blockchain to any connected
blockchain actually so and

3204
01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:25,119
blockchain actually so and
 

3205
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:27,270
blockchain actually so and
this means that the bridge can become

3206
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:27,280
this means that the bridge can become
 

3207
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,789
this means that the bridge can become
itself a very very very strong oracle so

3208
01:00:30,789 --> 01:00:30,799
itself a very very very strong oracle so
 

3209
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:33,270
itself a very very very strong oracle so
and this is something we really

3210
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:33,280
and this is something we really
 

3211
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,190
and this is something we really
were liking especially in the device

3212
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:35,200
were liking especially in the device
 

3213
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,829
were liking especially in the device
segment but also this is something uh

3214
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:37,839
segment but also this is something uh
 

3215
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,349
segment but also this is something uh
that can

3216
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:39,359
that can
 

3217
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:42,789
that can
be proposed to to other protocols

3218
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:42,799
be proposed to to other protocols
 

3219
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:45,750
be proposed to to other protocols
uh and uh last but not least is a nft

3220
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:45,760
uh and uh last but not least is a nft
 

3221
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,950
uh and uh last but not least is a nft
breach so the song long waited uh so and

3222
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:48,960
breach so the song long waited uh so and
 

3223
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:49,670
breach so the song long waited uh so and
we

3224
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:49,680
we
 

3225
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,270
we
actually have discussed with several

3226
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:51,280
actually have discussed with several
 

3227
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,710
actually have discussed with several
teams already on how they envision this

3228
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:54,720
teams already on how they envision this
 

3229
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,910
teams already on how they envision this
nft transfer between different chains

3230
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:57,920
nft transfer between different chains
 

3231
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,710
nft transfer between different chains
this is not a very easy task

3232
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:00,720
this is not a very easy task
 

3233
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,150
this is not a very easy task
because you need to think about

3234
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:02,160
because you need to think about
 

3235
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,069
because you need to think about
different

3236
01:01:04,069 --> 01:01:04,079
different
 

3237
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:06,309
different
situations different use cases

3238
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:06,319
situations different use cases
 

3239
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:07,190
situations different use cases
uh

3240
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:07,200
uh
 

3241
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,190
uh
of transferring nfts

3242
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:09,200
of transferring nfts
 

3243
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,710
of transferring nfts
based on where the content is stored or

3244
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:12,720
based on where the content is stored or
 

3245
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,870
based on where the content is stored or
how the nfd is structured but

3246
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:14,880
how the nfd is structured but
 

3247
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,430
how the nfd is structured but
all of this uh really uh

3248
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:17,440
all of this uh really uh
 

3249
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,630
all of this uh really uh
currently is blocked by the uniform nft

3250
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:20,640
currently is blocked by the uniform nft
 

3251
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,309

standard pretty much like for the

3252
01:01:22,309 --> 01:01:22,319
standard pretty much like for the
 

3253
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:25,190
standard pretty much like for the
fungible tokens what we have now

3254
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:25,200
fungible tokens what we have now
 

3255
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,470
fungible tokens what we have now
so we

3256
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:26,480
so we
 

3257
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,870
so we
are hoping that by end of february some

3258
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:28,880
are hoping that by end of february some
 

3259
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,910
are hoping that by end of february some
of the major uh nfc developers so they

3260
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:31,920
of the major uh nfc developers so they
 

3261
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,150
of the major uh nfc developers so they
will agree on certain standards

3262
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:34,160
will agree on certain standards
 

3263
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,950
will agree on certain standards
so that can be used just to integrate

3264
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:36,960
so that can be used just to integrate
 

3265
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,349
so that can be used just to integrate
into the bridge as well

3266
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:39,359
into the bridge as well
 

3267
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:42,470
into the bridge as well
uh speaking about the swap uh the the

3268
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:42,480
uh speaking about the swap uh the the
 

3269
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,950
uh speaking about the swap uh the the
major update it will receive this year

3270
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:44,960
major update it will receive this year
 

3271
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,829
major update it will receive this year
uh is its own token and

3272
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:47,839
uh is its own token and
 

3273
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:50,309
uh is its own token and
the dow so that will be

3274
01:01:50,309 --> 01:01:50,319
the dow so that will be
 

3275
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:53,190
the dow so that will be
managing the basic parameters of

01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:53,200
managing the basic parameters of
 

3277
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,109
managing the basic parameters of

of the swap
 

3279
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,630
of the swap
including uh

3280
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:56,640
including uh
 

3281
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,190
including uh
curves uh including uh

3282
01:01:59,190 --> 01:01:59,200
curves uh including uh
 

3283
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,549
curves uh including uh
fees for

3284
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:00,559
fees for
 

3285
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,549
fees for
for different kinds of polls including

01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:05,760
different updates and so on so forth
 

3289
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,670
different updates and so on so forth
but also uh

3290
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:07,680
but also uh
 

3291
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,670
but also uh
this means that

3292
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:09,680
this means that
 

3293
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,870
this means that
the the the decks will get much more

3294
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:12,880
the the the decks will get much more
 

3295
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,710
the the the decks will get much more
diversity in terms of uh and

3296
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:14,720
diversity in terms of uh and
 

3297
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,589
diversity in terms of uh and
possibilities in terms of exchange uh we

3298
01:02:17,589 --> 01:02:17,599
possibilities in terms of exchange uh we
 

3299
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,349
possibilities in terms of exchange uh we
were thinking also about a kind of

3300
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:21,359
were thinking also about a kind of
 

3301
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,270
were thinking also about a kind of
otc or p2p

3302
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:23,280
otc or p2p
 

3303
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,870
otc or p2p
mechanism

3304
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:24,880
mechanism
 

3305
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,430
mechanism
for a decentralized exchange so with a

3306
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:27,440
for a decentralized exchange so with a
 

3307
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,470
for a decentralized exchange so with a
really

3308
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:28,480
really
 

3309
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,589
really
low or

3310
01:02:29,589 --> 01:02:29,599
low or
 

3311
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:31,430
low or
totally no slippage

3312
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:31,440
totally no slippage
 

3313
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,109
totally no slippage
uh so but

3314
01:02:33,109 --> 01:02:33,119
uh so but
 

3315
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:35,190
uh so but
there is no still

3316
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:35,200
there is no still
 

3317
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,670
there is no still
strong position on how to do this and

3318
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:37,680
strong position on how to do this and
 

3319
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,349
strong position on how to do this and
also uh

3320
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:39,359
also uh
 

3321
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,829
also uh
as we are waiting for the appearance of

3322
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:41,839
as we are waiting for the appearance of
 

3323
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,990
as we are waiting for the appearance of
landing protocols uh in every scale

3324
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:44,000
landing protocols uh in every scale
 

3325
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,109
landing protocols uh in every scale
network so

3326
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:45,119
network so
 

3327
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,270
network so
uh hopefully we will be able able to

3328
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:47,280
uh hopefully we will be able able to
 

3329
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,870
uh hopefully we will be able able to
also offer some marginal trading

3330
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:50,880
also offer some marginal trading
 

3331
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:55,750
also offer some marginal trading
uh so speaking about the error wallet uh

3332
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:55,760
uh so speaking about the error wallet uh
 

3333
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,870
uh so speaking about the error wallet uh
quite a lot

3334
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:56,880
quite a lot
 

3335
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,109
quite a lot
will appear there and the major things

3336
01:02:59,109 --> 01:02:59,119
will appear there and the major things
 

3337
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:00,710
will appear there and the major things
that we were

3338
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:00,720
that we were
 

3339
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,670
that we were
asked

3340
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:01,680
asked
 

3341
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,470
asked
so many times i cannot even count so

3342
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:04,480
so many times i cannot even count so
 

3343
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,870
so many times i cannot even count so
this is the collectibles so you can

3344
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:06,880
this is the collectibles so you can
 

3345
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,230
this is the collectibles so you can
finally see your nfts in the wallet yay

3346
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,240
finally see your nfts in the wallet yay
 

3347
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,069
finally see your nfts in the wallet yay
so this is something

3348
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:12,079
so this is something
 

3349
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:15,029
so this is something
that exists in metamask for for a long

3350
01:03:15,029 --> 01:03:15,039
that exists in metamask for for a long
 

3351
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:16,470
that exists in metamask for for a long
period of time already

3352
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:16,480
period of time already
 

3353
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,589
period of time already
so and uh it will appear here as well so

3354
01:03:19,589 --> 01:03:19,599
so and uh it will appear here as well so
 

3355
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:20,710
so and uh it will appear here as well so
and

3356
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:20,720
and
 

3357
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,910
and
once we

3358
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:21,920
once we
 

3359
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,109
once we
uh get the uniform cnft standard

3360
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:25,119
uh get the uniform cnft standard
 

3361
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:27,430
uh get the uniform cnft standard
also a good thing uh it's a good

3362
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:27,440
also a good thing uh it's a good
 

3363
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,589
also a good thing uh it's a good
announcement that finally finally we've

3364
01:03:29,589 --> 01:03:29,599
announcement that finally finally we've
 

3365
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:33,829
announcement that finally finally we've
got a lsql application in ledger life so

3366
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:33,839
got a lsql application in ledger life so
 

3367
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,349
got a lsql application in ledger life so
it is still

3368
01:03:35,349 --> 01:03:35,359
it is still
 

3369
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,349
it is still
in the developer mode so if you are

3370
01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:37,359
in the developer mode so if you are
 

3371
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,990
in the developer mode so if you are
willing to test it so please just turn

3372
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:40,000
willing to test it so please just turn
 

3373
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,309
willing to test it so please just turn
the developer mode on you will see the

3374
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:42,319
the developer mode on you will see the
 

3375
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,549
the developer mode on you will see the
error scale app

3376
01:03:44,549 --> 01:03:44,559
error scale app
 

3377
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:48,870
error scale app
and now we are doing the security audit

3378
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:48,880
and now we are doing the security audit
 

3379
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,789
and now we are doing the security audit
so that is required to publish the

3380
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:50,799
so that is required to publish the
 

3381
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,150
so that is required to publish the
application

3382
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:52,160
application
 

3383
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,670
application
in production

3384
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:53,680
in production
 

3385
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,950
in production
so and this is really crucial because

3386
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:56,960
so and this is really crucial because
 

3387
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,870
so and this is really crucial because
most of the institutional investors they

3388
01:03:58,870 --> 01:03:58,880
most of the institutional investors they
 

3389
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,789
most of the institutional investors they
prefer hardware wallets to store their

3390
01:04:00,789 --> 01:04:00,799
prefer hardware wallets to store their
 

3391
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:01,750
prefer hardware wallets to store their
keys

3392
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:01,760
keys
 

3393
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,349
keys
and uh

3394
01:04:03,349 --> 01:04:03,359
and uh
 

3395
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:06,309
and uh
in fact we have the support for ledger

3396
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:06,319
in fact we have the support for ledger
 

3397
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:07,190
in fact we have the support for ledger
uh

3398
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:07,200
uh
 

3399
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,510
uh
for more than a year with

3400
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:09,520
for more than a year with
 

3401
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,990
for more than a year with
decathlon so and hopefully we will be

3402
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:12,000
decathlon so and hopefully we will be
 

3403
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,029
decathlon so and hopefully we will be
able to use it in our wallet finally

token lists so this will be something we

3448
01:05:10,069 --> 01:05:10,079
token lists so this will be something we
 

3449
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,349
token lists so this will be something we
will add both to the error wallet and to

3450
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:13,359
will add both to the error wallet and to
 

3451
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:15,910
will add both to the error wallet and to
to the swap

3452
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:15,920
to the swap
 

3453
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,829
to the swap
and this thing this

3454
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:17,839
and this thing this
 

3455
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:20,789
and this thing this
custom token list will be managed

3456
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:20,799
custom token list will be managed
 

3457
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:22,150

01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:37,510
so uh and
to add your tokens there you will need

to add your tokens there you will need
 

3473
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,309
to add your tokens there you will need
to make the pull requests there so as

to make the pull requests there so as
 

3475
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:41,430
to make the pull requests there so as
usual

3476

usual
 

3477
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,910
usual
and there will be also uh some lists

3478
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:43,920
and there will be also uh some lists
 

3479
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,549

kwpc so who as we discussed uh some time

3482
01:05:51,349 --> 01:05:51,359
kwpc so who as we discussed uh some time
 

3483
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,430
kwpc so who as we discussed uh some time
ago that probably some tokens of the

3484
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:53,440
ago that probably some tokens of the
 

3485
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,990
ago that probably some tokens of the
projects that will be launching on flags

3486
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:56,000
projects that will be launching on flags
 

3487
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,910
projects that will be launching on flags
will also appear on

3488
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:57,920
will also appear on
 

3489
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,589
will also appear on
on our swap

3490
01:05:59,589 --> 01:05:59,599
on our swap
 

3491
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:01,510
on our swap
and just to make

3492
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:01,520
and just to make
 

3493
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,990
and just to make
it possible for users to see this token

3494
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:04,000
it possible for users to see this token
 

3495
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,950
it possible for users to see this token
so there will be a custom token list

3496
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:06,960
so there will be a custom token list
 

3497
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,029
so there will be a custom token list
that will be

3498
01:06:09,029 --> 01:06:09,039
that will be
 

3499
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:11,349
that will be
doing this and that will manage

3500
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:11,359
doing this and that will manage
 

3501
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:16,309
doing this and that will manage
basically the pc team

3502
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:16,319

01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:36,400
contracts
 

3737
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,390
contracts
and uh so you can do that

3738
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:38,400
and uh so you can do that
 

3739
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,669
and uh so you can do that
um

3740
01:10:39,669 --> 01:10:39,679
um
 

3741
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:41,430
um
other than that we're building the

3742
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:41,440
other than that we're building the
 

3743
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,550
other than that we're building the
electric smart contract as as a plan

3744
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:44,560
electric smart contract as as a plan
 

3745
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,070
electric smart contract as as a plan
goes and uh

3746
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:46,080
goes and uh
 

3747
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,669
goes and uh
once it has been developed and validated

3748
01:10:49,669 --> 01:10:49,679
once it has been developed and validated
 

3749
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,189
once it has been developed and validated
verified

3750
01:10:51,189 --> 01:10:51,199
verified
 

3751
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:52,390
verified
uh we're going to replace the

3752
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:52,400
uh we're going to replace the
 

3753
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,310
uh we're going to replace the
electrosmart contract with the delector

3754
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:54,320
electrosmart contract with the delector
 

3755
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,390
electrosmart contract with the delector
smart contracts it's a big big big

3756
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:56,400
smart contracts it's a big big big
 

3757
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,390
smart contracts it's a big big big
change actually in terms of like the

3758
01:10:58,390 --> 01:10:58,400
change actually in terms of like the
 

3759
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,110
change actually in terms of like the
whole architecture of everything

3760
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:01,120
whole architecture of everything
 

3761
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,189
whole architecture of everything
and then because that will deprecate

3762
01:11:03,189 --> 01:11:03,199
and then because that will deprecate
 

3763
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,189
and then because that will deprecate
electro and it will deprecate the pulse

3764
01:11:05,189 --> 01:11:05,199
electro and it will deprecate the pulse
 

3765
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:06,149
electro and it will deprecate the pulse
as well

3766
01:11:06,149 --> 01:11:06,159
as well
 

3767
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:08,630
as well
so it's a it's a huge change to

3768
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:08,640
so it's a it's a huge change to
 

3769
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,310
so it's a it's a huge change to
to the to the kind of

3770
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:10,320
to the to the kind of
 

3771
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,830
to the to the kind of
underlying

3772
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:11,840
underlying
 

3773
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,510
underlying
blockchain infrastructure in terms of

3774
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:13,520
blockchain infrastructure in terms of
 

3775
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,870
blockchain infrastructure in terms of
staking

3776
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:14,880
staking
 

3777
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,110
staking
yeah it's a very good change as well

3778
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:17,120
yeah it's a very good change as well
 

3779
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,830
yeah it's a very good change as well
so um

3780
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:19,840

 

3781
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,470

no more elections

3782
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:22,480
no more elections
 

3783
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,470
no more elections
and stuff like that no more stress to

3784
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:24,480
and stuff like that no more stress to
 

3785
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,149
and stuff like that no more stress to
the network

3786
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:26,159
the network
 

3787
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:28,870
the network
liquidity fuel everything supported and

3788
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:28,880
liquidity fuel everything supported and
 

3789
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,470
liquidity fuel everything supported and
one that's like a

3790
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:30,480
one that's like a
 

3791
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,070
one that's like a
huge

3792
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:32,080
huge
 

3793
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,870
huge
underlying technology for all the defy

3794
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:34,880
underlying technology for all the defy
 

3795
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,630
underlying technology for all the defy
infrastructure as well

3796
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:36,640
infrastructure as well
 

3797
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,229
infrastructure as well
important so yeah but um and it's

3798
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:40,239
important so yeah but um and it's
 

3799
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:41,910
important so yeah but um and it's
simplification actually

3800
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:41,920
simplification actually
 

3801
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,430
simplification actually
believe it or not

3802
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:43,440
believe it or not
 

3803
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,830
believe it or not
so as every good design

3804
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:45,840
so as every good design
 

3805
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,350
so as every good design
should actually simplify things so yeah

3806
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:49,360
should actually simplify things so yeah
 

3807
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,110
should actually simplify things so yeah
but but before it's done then there is

3808
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:51,120
but but before it's done then there is
 

3809
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,110
but but before it's done then there is
an intermediate solution

3810
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:53,120
an intermediate solution
 

3811
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,189
an intermediate solution
that's it basically

3812
01:11:55,189 --> 01:11:55,199
that's it basically
 

3813
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:56,470
that's it basically
okay thank you

3814
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:56,480
okay thank you
 

3815
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,630
okay thank you
um and uh the second question i think

3816
01:11:58,630 --> 01:11:58,640
um and uh the second question i think
 

3817
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,630
um and uh the second question i think
it's been partially answered but i'll

3818
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:00,640
it's been partially answered but i'll
 

3819
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:03,189
it's been partially answered but i'll
ask it for the sake of announcing it uh

3820
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:03,199
ask it for the sake of announcing it uh
 

3821
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:05,189
ask it for the sake of announcing it uh
will there be a separate q a session for

3822
01:12:05,189 --> 01:12:05,199
will there be a separate q a session for
 

3823
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:08,470
will there be a separate q a session for
the ever slash never monetary system

3824
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:08,480
the ever slash never monetary system
 

3825
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,189
the ever slash never monetary system
um glad we can we can do that at any

3826
01:12:11,189 --> 01:12:11,199
um glad we can we can do that at any

published
 

3849
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:39,110
published
design of that for a year already

3850
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:39,120

 

3851
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,310

so

3852
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:40,320
so
 

3853
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,170
so
it's like um

3854
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:41,180
it's like um

01:12:45,189 --> 01:12:45,199
it's very simple system so actually not
 

3859
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:47,189
it's very simple system so actually not
nothing too complicated to compare it to

3860
01:12:47,189 --> 01:12:47,199
nothing too complicated to compare it to
 

3861
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:49,590
nothing too complicated to compare it to
what media is doing

3862
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:49,600
what media is doing
 

3863
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,070
what media is doing
right now with the network

3864
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:52,080
right now with the network
 

3865
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:55,990
right now with the network
no it's not very it's not too simple

3866
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:56,000
no it's not very it's not too simple
 

3867
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,669
no it's not very it's not too simple
system because it's still there there

3868
01:12:57,669 --> 01:12:57,679
system because it's still there there
 

3869
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:59,510
system because it's still there there
are degree auctions there there is there

3870
01:12:59,510 --> 01:12:59,520
are degree auctions there there is there
 

3871
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,070
are degree auctions there there is there
are some subsystems yeah but

3872
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:02,080
are some subsystems yeah but
 

3873
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,870
are some subsystems yeah but
the concept itself is really easy to

3874
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:04,880
the concept itself is really easy to
 

3875
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,229
the concept itself is really easy to
understand

3876
01:13:06,229 --> 01:13:06,239
understand
 

3877
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:07,910
understand
yeah it should be easy i would say this

3878
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:07,920
yeah it should be easy i would say this
 

3879
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,229
yeah it should be easy i would say this
way yes i have already

3880
01:13:10,229 --> 01:13:10,239
way yes i have already
 

3881
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:12,470
way yes i have already
for me what what i consider easy

3882
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:12,480
for me what what i consider easy
 

3883
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,150
for me what what i consider easy

3891
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,030

it's because you're a rockstar media not

3892
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:23,040
it's because you're a rockstar media not

3895
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,709
everybody doesn't braxton i don't think
because of that but anyway let's keep

3896
01:13:26,709 --> 01:13:26,719
because of that but anyway let's keep
 

3897
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:28,950
because of that but anyway let's keep
this point

this point
 

3899
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,270
this point
right we have uh we have a few questions

3900
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:31,280
right we have uh we have a few questions
 

3901
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,350
right we have uh we have a few questions
that were written to us um so let me

3902
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:33,360
that were written to us um so let me
