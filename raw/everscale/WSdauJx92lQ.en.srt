trend
 

109
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,710
trend
uh we see it mean in other blockchains

110
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
uh we see it mean in other blockchains
 

111
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,190
uh we see it mean in other blockchains
when

112
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
when
 

113
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,310
when
where people uh take a nice state uh

114

rights or state tokens
 

117
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,030
rights or state tokens
now in our case it is uh true

118
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
now in our case it is uh true
 

119
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,509
now in our case it is uh true
state tokens because they are

120
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
state tokens because they are
 

121
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,949
state tokens because they are
decentralized they do

122
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
decentralized they do
 

123
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,150
decentralized they do
do not rely on

124
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160
do not rely on
 

125
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,269
do not rely on
on any relay um so

126
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
on any relay um so
 

127
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,310
on any relay um so
in our case uh such tokens can be

128
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
in our case uh such tokens can be
 

129
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,630
in our case uh such tokens can be
again true um so

130
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
again true um so
 

131
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,069
again true um so
uh yeah i thought that it is quite

132
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
uh yeah i thought that it is quite
 

133
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,230
uh yeah i thought that it is quite
easy and quite short contest of course i

134
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
easy and quite short contest of course i
 

135
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,910
easy and quite short contest of course i
mean i got some comments that

136
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920

it probably will require more time and

138
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
it probably will require more time and
 

139
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,790
it probably will require more time and
will require more effort

140
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
will require more effort
 

141
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,630
will require more effort
and i agree with that i think that

142
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:36,640
and i agree with that i think that
 

143
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,150
and i agree with that i think that
in order not to to spoil this one let's

in order not to to spoil this one let's
 

145
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,790
in order not to to spoil this one let's
increase timing less for for i don't

146
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:42,800
increase timing less for for i don't
 

147
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,230
increase timing less for for i don't
know

148

yeah i think
 

153
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,150
yeah i think
one month is sufficient for such a type

154
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
one month is sufficient for such a type
 

155
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,350

kind of funchable so they are equal but

178
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
kind of funchable so they are equal but
 

179
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,389
kind of funchable so they are equal but
what is

180
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
what is
 

181
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,430
what is
amazing that we have also westing

182
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440
amazing that we have also westing
 

183
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,350
amazing that we have also westing
tokens and the wasting and rights for

184
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
tokens and the wasting and rights for
 

185
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,269
tokens and the wasting and rights for
wasting

186
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279
wasting
 

187
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,990
wasting
tokens they depended on term of

188
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000

 

189
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,910

of of the investing so in that respect

190
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
of of the investing so in that respect
 

191
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,829
of of the investing so in that respect
i think uh the such tokens

192
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
i think uh the such tokens
 

193
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,949
i think uh the such tokens
can differ depending on amount number of

194
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:40,959
can differ depending on amount number of
 

195
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,310
can differ depending on amount number of
uh cycles they are requested for

196
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
uh cycles they are requested for
 

197
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,829
uh cycles they are requested for
so it means that we will have like

198
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
so it means that we will have like
 

199
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,350
so it means that we will have like
100 different types of stacked tones

200
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
100 different types of stacked tones
 

201
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,110
100 different types of stacked tones
uh which will represent different

202
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
uh which will represent different
 

203
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,550
uh which will represent different
wasting times

204
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,560
wasting times
 

205
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,550
wasting times
and this is i think very interesting

206
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
and this is i think very interesting
 

207
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,750
and this is i think very interesting
because uh

208
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
because uh
 

209
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,110
because uh
it reminds me uh yield curve

210
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
it reminds me uh yield curve
 

211
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,389
it reminds me uh yield curve
such thing from uh finance industry

212
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:04,399
such thing from uh finance industry
 

213
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,509
such thing from uh finance industry
which actually and people do quite uh

214
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:07,519
which actually and people do quite uh
 

215
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,550
which actually and people do quite uh
interesting strategies on top of that so

216
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
interesting strategies on top of that so
 

217
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,870
interesting strategies on top of that so
when

218
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:10,880
when
 

219
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,470
when
they play with yield curve they think

220
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
they play with yield curve they think
 

221
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,150
they play with yield curve they think
like

222
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
like
 

223
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,750
like
that that curves change over time

224
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
that that curves change over time
 

225
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,870
that that curves change over time
uh so i think it will be nice especially

226
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
uh so i think it will be nice especially
 

227
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,910
uh so i think it will be nice especially
taking the card that

228
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
taking the card that
 

229
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,750
taking the card that
decks are coming so we'll have not only

230
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:23,760
decks are coming so we'll have not only
 

231
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,389
decks are coming so we'll have not only
one stake tom will have like

232
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399
one stake tom will have like
 

233
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,310
one stake tom will have like
many of them so i will make adjustments

234
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,320
many of them so i will make adjustments
 

235
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,350
many of them so i will make adjustments
to that uh contest and if there are no

236
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
to that uh contest and if there are no
 

237
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,670
to that uh contest and if there are no
other questions let's put it on

238
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:37,680
other questions let's put it on
 

239
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,069
other questions let's put it on
yeah i i just uh had a look through

240
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:40,079
yeah i i just uh had a look through
 

241
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,350
yeah i i just uh had a look through
through the contest and yes

242
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
through the contest and yes
 

243
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,150
through the contest and yes
i agree that it definitely needs more

244
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
i agree that it definitely needs more
 

245
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,990
i agree that it definitely needs more
time than 10 days because

246
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
time than 10 days because
 

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,350
time than 10 days because
uh first of all it needs

248
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:49,360
uh first of all it needs
 

249
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,870
uh first of all it needs
some time to to build the architecture

250
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
some time to to build the architecture
 

251
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,269
some time to to build the architecture
of this

252
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
of this
 

253
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,870
of this
of this stuff because we start from the

254
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:54,880
of this stuff because we start from the
 

255
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,389
of this stuff because we start from the
implementation part

256
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
implementation part
 

257
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,430
implementation part
and uh second test pavel said

258
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
and uh second test pavel said
 

259
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,269
and uh second test pavel said
there is not only ordinary stakes but

260
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279
there is not only ordinary stakes but
 

261
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,949
there is not only ordinary stakes but
also western stakes and it

262
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
also western stakes and it
 

263
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,710
also western stakes and it
also needs some time to think through

264
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
also needs some time to think through
 

265
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,430
also needs some time to think through
but in my opinion one month is

266
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
but in my opinion one month is
 

267
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,150
but in my opinion one month is
sufficient

268
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
sufficient
 

269
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,430
sufficient
so unless anyone has

270
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
so unless anyone has
 

271
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,430
so unless anyone has
some some other opinions that can be

272
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
some some other opinions that can be
 

273
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,550
some some other opinions that can be
justified

274
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560
justified
 

275
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,230
justified
and uh if it's if it's so

276
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,240
and uh if it's if it's so
 

277
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,470
and uh if it's if it's so
so and but we can just make some

278
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
so and but we can just make some
 

279
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,590
so and but we can just make some
amendments so

280
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
amendments so
 

281
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,150
amendments so
probably we will be able even to launch

282
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
probably we will be able even to launch
 

283
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,790
probably we will be able even to launch
it uh

284
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
it uh
 

285
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,910
it uh
on monday probably so it's it's not that

286
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
on monday probably so it's it's not that
 

287
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,949
on monday probably so it's it's not that
complex as

288
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
complex as
 

289
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,990
complex as
dexes or bridges so it's just

290
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
dexes or bridges so it's just
 

291
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,430
dexes or bridges so it's just
a set of smart contracts pretty much uh

292
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
a set of smart contracts pretty much uh
 

293
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,710
a set of smart contracts pretty much uh
standards uh tip3 token i think

294
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:40,720
standards uh tip3 token i think
 

295
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,790
standards uh tip3 token i think
with some additional functionality on

296
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
with some additional functionality on
 

297
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,310
with some additional functionality on
top of this

298
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
top of this
 

299
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,350
top of this
uh yeah and also what i would like to

300
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
uh yeah and also what i would like to
 

301
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,990
uh yeah and also what i would like to
recommend

302
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
recommend
 

303
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,350
recommend
is first to have a look

304
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
is first to have a look
 

305
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,829
is first to have a look
on different types of tipster tokens

306
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
on different types of tipster tokens
 

307
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,389
on different types of tipster tokens
that already exists

308
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:56,399
that already exists
 

309
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,069
that already exists
and choose the one that you

310
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
and choose the one that you
 

311
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,629
and choose the one that you
think is most suitable yeah for not to

312
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
think is most suitable yeah for not to
 

313
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,629
think is most suitable yeah for not to
invent the intimate the wheel

314
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639
invent the intimate the wheel
 

315
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,030
invent the intimate the wheel
and just build your solution on top of

316
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
and just build your solution on top of
 

317
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,030
and just build your solution on top of
this

318
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
this
 

319
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,150
this
i have one uh question actually

320
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,160

 

321
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,430

let me take a look media is here uh yeah

322
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
let me take a look media is here uh yeah
 

323
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,550
let me take a look media is here uh yeah
he's here

324
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:18,560
he's here
 

325
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,110
he's here
okay great uh me there um so we

326
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,120
okay great uh me there um so we
 

327
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,829
okay great uh me there um so we
discussed it

328
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
discussed it
 

329
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,790
discussed it
uh some time ago uh that wrapping the

330
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:24,800
uh some time ago uh that wrapping the
 

331
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,189
uh some time ago uh that wrapping the
the

332
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:25,199
the
 

333
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,550
the
the question is that uh you need to be

334
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,560
the question is that uh you need to be
 

335
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:28,949
the question is that uh you need to be
sure

336
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:28,959
sure
 

337
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,990
sure
that you got transfer from

338
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
that you got transfer from
 

339
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,310
that you got transfer from
deepu correct people contact so

340
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
deepu correct people contact so
 

341
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,470
deepu correct people contact so
in that respect i guess there are some

342
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480
in that respect i guess there are some
 

343
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,509
in that respect i guess there are some
changes

344
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:39,519
changes
 

345
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,110
changes
in virtual machine we had where you can

346
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120
in virtual machine we had where you can
 

347
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,590
in virtual machine we had where you can
check

348
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
check
 

349
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,189
check
the hash of initial uh contracts so

350
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199
the hash of initial uh contracts so
 

351
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,470
the hash of initial uh contracts so
when it will be introduced because i

352
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
when it will be introduced because i

think this this functionality

354
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
think this this functionality
 

355
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,870
think this this functionality
should be important for that particular

356
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
should be important for that particular
 

357
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,750
should be important for that particular
contest because without it

358
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:57,760
contest because without it
 

359
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,509
contest because without it
it could be problematic to me to make

360
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
it could be problematic to me to make
 

361
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,350
it could be problematic to me to make
generic uh

362
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
generic uh
 

363
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,910
generic uh
wrapper because we don't want to have

because again if the pools are waiting

370
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
because again if the pools are waiting
 

371
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,910
because again if the pools are waiting
you you can check the crash code of the

372
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
you you can check the crash code of the
 

373
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,790
you you can check the crash code of the
pool right now

374
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
pool right now
 

375
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,230
pool right now
right so you don't need

376
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,240
right so you don't need
 

377
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,750
right so you don't need
this this this uh checking it has

378
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:23,760
this this this uh checking it has
 

379
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,189
this this this uh checking it has
checked the initiative

380
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
checked the initiative
 

381
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,749
checked the initiative
is not for that it's for verifying that

382
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:29,759
is not for that it's for verifying that
 

383
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,230
is not for that it's for verifying that
the address was calculated correctly

384
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,240
the address was calculated correctly
 

385
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,350
the address was calculated correctly
initially from the write code

386
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:35,360
initially from the write code
 

387
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,069
initially from the write code
um so so this is this is i don't know

388
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:38,079
um so so this is this is i don't know
 

389
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:38,470
um so so this is this is i don't know
how

390
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480
how
 

391
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,990
how
if you have a depool it doesn't matter

392
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
if you have a depool it doesn't matter
 

393
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,150
if you have a depool it doesn't matter
what what was the default address

394
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
what what was the default address
 

395
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,790
what what was the default address
or what is the default address it's the

396
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
or what is the default address it's the
 

397
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,670
or what is the default address it's the
the right

398
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:45,680
the right
 

399
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,470
the right
um question to ask is what is the cash

400
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,480
um question to ask is what is the cash
 

401
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,949
um question to ask is what is the cash
contract right now

402
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:50,959
contract right now
 

403
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,430
contract right now
right so and you can you can check that

404
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,440
right so and you can you can check that
 

405
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,310
right so and you can you can check that
so and it's it's not the bull has

406
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
so and it's it's not the bull has
 

407
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,430
so and it's it's not the bull has
transfer

408
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
transfer
 

409
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,829
transfer
mechanism so you can easily create a

410
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
mechanism so you can easily create a
 

411
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:02,710
mechanism so you can easily create a
contract

412
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
contract
 

413
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,389
contract
which will take the the tokens

414
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:06,399
which will take the the tokens
 

415
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,110
which will take the the tokens
so someone if someone wants you know

416
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
so someone if someone wants you know
 

417
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,590
so someone if someone wants you know
this

418
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
this
 

419
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,069
this
the to use this um whatever the

420
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
the to use this um whatever the
 

421
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,590
the to use this um whatever the
functionality

422
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
functionality
 

423
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,629
functionality
of that contract is like liquidity or

424
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:16,639
of that contract is like liquidity or
 

425
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,110
of that contract is like liquidity or
whatever

426
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,120
whatever
 

427
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,189
whatever
so he first of all this person need to

428
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:21,199
so he first of all this person need to
 

429
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,710
so he first of all this person need to
trust this contract

430
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
trust this contract
 

431
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,870
trust this contract
right so that's that's a totally other

432

we create some few contracts like that

436
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,120
we create some few contracts like that
 

437
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,189
we create some few contracts like that
we're formally verified and whatever

we're formally verified and whatever
now everyone trusts them like the

440
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
now everyone trusts them like the
 

441
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,030
now everyone trusts them like the

692
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:24,799
but but the patch is not on the main net
 

693
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,990
but but the patch is not on the main net
yet

694
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
yet
 

695
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,909
yet
yeah i remember that yeah so yeah yeah i

696
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:27,919
yeah i remember that yeah so yeah yeah i
 

697
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,990
yeah i remember that yeah so yeah yeah i
don't remember try to run it at home

698
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000
don't remember try to run it at home
 

699
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,950
don't remember try to run it at home
i i remember at all at all absolutely

700
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:32,960
i i remember at all at all absolutely
 

701
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,350
i i remember at all at all absolutely
and

702
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
and
 

703
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,470
and
uh so uh we strongly improved the

704
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:36,480
uh so uh we strongly improved the
 

705
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,470
uh so uh we strongly improved the
security of both solutions

706
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480
security of both solutions
 

707
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,990
security of both solutions
uh and redeployed the boss bridge

708
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,000
uh and redeployed the boss bridge
 

709
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,190
uh and redeployed the boss bridge
and uh don't swap io so now it's

710
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,200
and uh don't swap io so now it's
 

711
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,630
and uh don't swap io so now it's
it's uh even more secure and reliable

712
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
it's uh even more secure and reliable
 

713
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,549
it's uh even more secure and reliable
than before although it it's already

714
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:50,559
than before although it it's already
 

715
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,990
than before although it it's already
have been like this but

716
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,000
have been like this but
 

717
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,310
have been like this but
there were some very very narrow and

718
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,320
there were some very very narrow and
 

719
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,149
there were some very very narrow and
specific situations where

720
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:56,159
specific situations where
 

721
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,190
specific situations where
uh an attacker could stall the bridge

722
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,200
uh an attacker could stall the bridge
 

723
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,470
uh an attacker could stall the bridge
uh not just uh take the money but

724
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
uh not just uh take the money but
 

725
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,990
uh not just uh take the money but
uh really intervene and stall it

726
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000
uh really intervene and stall it
 

727
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,430
uh really intervene and stall it
so now it's not normal possible and uh

728
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:09,440
so now it's not normal possible and uh
 

729
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,590
so now it's not normal possible and uh
guys from brock's team are working now

730
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:11,600
guys from brock's team are working now
 

731
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,710
guys from brock's team are working now
hard hard

732
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:12,720
hard hard
 

733
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,070
hard hard
to implement dao in both projects and

734
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080
to implement dao in both projects and
 

735
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,110
to implement dao in both projects and
i i hope that it will come

736
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120

 

737
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,470

within a month probably i would be brave

738
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
within a month probably i would be brave
 

739
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,270
within a month probably i would be brave
to say this

740
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,280
to say this
 

741
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,830
to say this
it's not an easy task at all but we're

742
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
it's not an easy task at all but we're
 

743
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,430
it's not an easy task at all but we're
working hard on this

744
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:29,440
working hard on this
 

745
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,950
working hard on this
and uh we also added

746
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:32,960
and uh we also added
 

747
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,470
and uh we also added
uh one more important uh

748
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:36,480
uh one more important uh
 

749
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,149
uh one more important uh
thing i will show to you now uh

750
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
thing i will show to you now uh
 

751
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,549
thing i will show to you now uh
that you will like probably especially

752
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:42,559
that you will like probably especially
 

753
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,149
that you will like probably especially
if you tried already

754
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:44,159
if you tried already
 

755
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,630
if you tried already
to participate in the previous farming

756
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:48,640
to participate in the previous farming
 

757
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,110
to participate in the previous farming
program

758
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,120
program
 

759
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,430
program
that we uh pilot farming programs that

760
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:51,440
that we uh pilot farming programs that
 

761
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,750
that we uh pilot farming programs that
we launched a few weeks ago

762
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:53,760
we launched a few weeks ago
 

763
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,909
we launched a few weeks ago
so actually we added the farming

764
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:55,919
so actually we added the farming
 

765
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:56,789
so actually we added the farming
constructor

766
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:56,799
constructor
 

767
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,990
constructor
uh at tonsoipaio so that lets you

768
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,000
uh at tonsoipaio so that lets you
 

769
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,669
uh at tonsoipaio so that lets you
to create the farming pool uh specifying

770
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:03,679
to create the farming pool uh specifying
 

771
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,470
to create the farming pool uh specifying
the

772
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,480
the
 

773
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,789
the
talking route that needs to be deposited

774
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:06,799
talking route that needs to be deposited
 

775
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,909
talking route that needs to be deposited
and

776
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:07,919
and
 

777
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,830
and
the the token that is paid as a reward

778
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
the the token that is paid as a reward
 

779
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,190
the the token that is paid as a reward
to you and you can just input the amount

780
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,200
to you and you can just input the amount
 

781
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,990
to you and you can just input the amount
of the rewards it

782
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
of the rewards it
 

783
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,029
of the rewards it
will be distributed and then

784
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:19,039
will be distributed and then
 

785
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,070
will be distributed and then
put it on this deployed contract so

786
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,080
put it on this deployed contract so
 

787
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,350
put it on this deployed contract so
it's that easy and once you have this

788
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,360
it's that easy and once you have this
 

789
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,110
it's that easy and once you have this
specific token you can see the list of

790
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,120
specific token you can see the list of
 

791
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,390
specific token you can see the list of
farming pools so and just

792
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:32,400
farming pools so and just
 

793
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,669
farming pools so and just
deposit it here it works uh

794
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679
deposit it here it works uh
 

795
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,190
deposit it here it works uh
in uh to go together with a

796
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,200
in uh to go together with a
 

797
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,830
in uh to go together with a
tone crystal uh extension so that

798
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:41,840
tone crystal uh extension so that
 

799
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,470
tone crystal uh extension so that
currently

800
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
currently
 

801
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,230
currently
serves as a tone client for the app

802
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,240
serves as a tone client for the app
 

803
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,230
serves as a tone client for the app
and if you try for example to

804
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
and if you try for example to
 

805
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,269
and if you try for example to
like i did here i already put some lp

806
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:53,279
like i did here i already put some lp
 

807
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:53,990
like i did here i already put some lp
tokens

808
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000
tokens
 

809
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,870
tokens
from uh from the pool here so if i try

810
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:56,880
from uh from the pool here so if i try
 

811
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,590
from uh from the pool here so if i try
to claim

812
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,600
to claim
 

813
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,870
to claim
it will just initiate the transaction

814
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:00,880
it will just initiate the transaction
 

815
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,350
it will just initiate the transaction
to withdraw and pretty the same to

816
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,360
to withdraw and pretty the same to
 

817
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,149
to withdraw and pretty the same to
deposit

818
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:04,159
deposit
 

819
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,510
deposit
so and and to claim your reward so it's

820
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:07,520
so and and to claim your reward so it's
 

821
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,669
so and and to claim your reward so it's
now significantly easier to to

822
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:09,679
now significantly easier to to
 

823
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,590
now significantly easier to to
participate in farming

824
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:11,600
participate in farming
 

825
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,710
participate in farming
and uh i will give now

826
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:14,720
and uh i will give now
 

827
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,710
and uh i will give now
a word to sergey shachev who will

828
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:16,720
a word to sergey shachev who will
 

829
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,750
a word to sergey shachev who will
announce

the next farming programs so it will be
 

833
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,230
the next farming programs so it will be
run run started from today

it was magic
 

1297
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,710
it was magic
in the magic all protocols

1298
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:42,720
in the magic all protocols
 

1299
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,190
in the magic all protocols
work good because we had a personal

1300
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,200
work good because we had a personal
 

1301
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,790
work good because we had a personal
position in magic

1302
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:46,800
position in magic
 

1303
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,149
position in magic
and they had no any problems

1304
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:50,159
and they had no any problems
 

1305
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,750
and they had no any problems
but uh not a lot of protocol used it now

1306
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:53,760
but uh not a lot of protocol used it now
 

1307
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,069
but uh not a lot of protocol used it now
and it's how it's our chance because all

1308
00:34:56,069 --> 00:34:56,079
and it's how it's our chance because all
 

1309
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,829
and it's how it's our chance because all
fans discovered

1310
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:57,839
fans discovered
 

1311
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,270
fans discovered
uh how it worked in reality of a big

1312
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:01,280
uh how it worked in reality of a big
 

1313
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,390
uh how it worked in reality of a big
transaction about the federal network

and so i think that this situation a lot

1316
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:07,520
and so i think that this situation a lot
 

1317
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,670
and so i think that this situation a lot
of protocols and investors

1318
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:09,680
of protocols and investors
 

1319
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,630
