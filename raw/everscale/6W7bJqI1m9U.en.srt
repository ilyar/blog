um this new version is introducing
compression

140
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
compression
 

141
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,630
compression
um and uh just by virtue of upgrading to

142
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
um and uh just by virtue of upgrading to
 

143
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,270
um and uh just by virtue of upgrading to
this new version we don't need to turn

144
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
this new version we don't need to turn
 

145
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,150
this new version we don't need to turn
that on it will turn on automatically

146
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
that on it will turn on automatically
 

147
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,750
that on it will turn on automatically
when

148
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
when
 

149
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,470
when
it's just the network the more nodes we

150
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
it's just the network the more nodes we
 

151
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,710
it's just the network the more nodes we
introduce basically then the network

152
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
introduce basically then the network
 

153
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,509
introduce basically then the network
will

154
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
will
 

155
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,470
will
start

156
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
start
 

157
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,030
start
slowly migrate into a compression

158
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
slowly migrate into a compression
 

159
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,910
slowly migrate into a compression
traffic version

160
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
traffic version
 

161
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,790
traffic version
um so you can see that there is about

162
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
um so you can see that there is about
 

163
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,710
um so you can see that there is about
eight percent of the network already

164
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
eight percent of the network already
 

165
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,790
eight percent of the network already
like at seven percent of the network

166
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
like at seven percent of the network
 

167
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,110
like at seven percent of the network
already in

168
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
already in
 

169
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,750
already in
running this note we're slowly slowly

170
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
running this note we're slowly slowly
 

171
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,270
running this note we're slowly slowly
upgrading that

172
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
upgrading that
 

173
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,070
upgrading that
now

174
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
now
 

175
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,910
now
um we cannot upgrade we cannot just

176
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
um we cannot upgrade we cannot just
 

177
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,589
um we cannot upgrade we cannot just
release the upgrades because um

178
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
release the upgrades because um
 

179
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,390
release the upgrades because um
this fix it goes to the whole depth of

180
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
this fix it goes to the whole depth of
 

181
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,910
this fix it goes to the whole depth of
all the

182
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
all the
 

183
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,750
all the
all the cells in the

184
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:33,760
all the cells in the
 

185
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,430
all the cells in the
in the state

186
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
in the state
 

187
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,149
in the state
and in order to do that the network may

188
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
and in order to do that the network may
 

189
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,670
and in order to do that the network may
stop for about 40 minutes in some

190
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
stop for about 40 minutes in some
 

191
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,390
stop for about 40 minutes in some
to just to kind of

192
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
to just to kind of
 

193
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,470
to just to kind of
copy everything it needs

194
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
copy everything it needs
 

195
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,190
copy everything it needs
uh and therefore if we just introduce it

196
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
uh and therefore if we just introduce it
 

197
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,190
uh and therefore if we just introduce it
and everyone will upgrade it once the

198
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
and everyone will upgrade it once the
 

199
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,670
and everyone will upgrade it once the
network will stop for some time which we

200
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,680
network will stop for some time which we
 

201
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,990
network will stop for some time which we
don't want to do

202
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
don't want to do
 

203
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,589
don't want to do
for that

204
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
for that
 

205
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,149
for that
the upgrade will be slowly introduced to

206
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
the upgrade will be slowly introduced to
 

207
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,630
the upgrade will be slowly introduced to
different validators i will write you

208
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
different validators i will write you
 

209
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,309
different validators i will write you
guys so someone will write your gym will

210
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
guys so someone will write your gym will
 

211
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,190
guys so someone will write your gym will
write you and ask you to upgrade the

212
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
write you and ask you to upgrade the
 

213
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,429
write you and ask you to upgrade the
node and you will upgrade the node and

214
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
node and you will upgrade the node and
 

215
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,110
node and you will upgrade the node and
then we will go and so on and so forth

216
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
then we will go and so on and so forth
 

217
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,070
then we will go and so on and so forth
so we will just reach out until we kind

218
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
so we will just reach out until we kind
 

219
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,429
so we will just reach out until we kind
of upgrading

220
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
of upgrading
 

221
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,469
of upgrading
something like uh you know 70 percent of

222
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
something like uh you know 70 percent of
 

223
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:19,830
something like uh you know 70 percent of
the network

224
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
the network
 

225
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,830
the network
like that and we will release the

226
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
like that and we will release the
 

227
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,230
like that and we will release the
that the general upgrade so

228
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
that the general upgrade so
 

229
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,220
that the general upgrade so
um

230
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:25,230

again it's it's um
 

235
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,830
again it's it's um
rarely happens but

236
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
rarely happens but
 

237
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,590
rarely happens but
but that's that's the only way really to

238
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
but that's that's the only way really to
 

239
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,670
but that's that's the only way really to
do that

240
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
do that
 

241
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,550
do that
and um yeah we'll just do that by the

242
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
and um yeah we'll just do that by the
 

243
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,150
and um yeah we'll just do that by the
end of this procedure the network will

244
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
end of this procedure the network will
 

245
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,189
end of this procedure the network will
run

246
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
run
 

247
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,469
run
the version

248
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
the version
 

249
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,230
the version
which which has

00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
which which has
 

251
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,150
which which has
almost everything we wanted on this

almost everything we wanted on this
 

253
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,870

stage before we move to
 

255
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,710
stage before we move to
next kind of

256
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720

and and introducing ramp
but before we can do that we need to

264
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
but before we can do that we need to
 

265
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,469
but before we can do that we need to
go for this stage and introduce these

00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
go for this stage and introduce these
 

267

other metaphors to this uh
 

1351
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,190
other metaphors to this uh
to this door or

1352

to this door or
 

1353
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,950
to this door or
this one

1354
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:52,960
this one
 

1355
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,470
this one
so there will be just three three
