all right so there is a defy
contest which just finished on sunday
which is a decentralized exchange
contest
now we took part in that and the
solution that we are going to show now
is a part of this contest now we don't
want
this to anyhow put us in any advantages
position
with respect to other contest
participants
so i want just to mention to the jury of
this contest that you should not take
this demo as any kind of
advantage you should give all the other
contests participants
the same chance to explain to you what
their solution
is and what the benefits there might be
i
went through the solutions very briefly
there are six of them
so five uh on top of tonlap solution and
i didn't find any solution that would be
similar in terms of architecture so if i
would
i would not present today but since i
didn't then
i'm taking this freedom to present this
solution that's all the disclaimers i
wanted to make
let me start the demo
okay we'll start from my part and then
nikita will present
another part and then i will explain a
little bit about
why this is cool
so this is a serve which supports the
bots
and i have a little debot here
which is called flex debot flex devote
is the bot of flesh exchange
that we have created and there are some
tip three tokens that i have listed here
in this debot and let me trade with some
of them
so i choose snack and i see here
order book of this token so i can see
who is
buying selling and what price they're
doing that
all of that i think it's pretty familiar
to anyone who have ever used in exchange
let me buy some tip three tokens so let
me buy this
i like that so 40 tokens on zero one
price
let's buy 20 of them
and yeah it says me that it will take
some money
and it would return some back from my
wallet and will return some of them back
sending message and the the the order
has been sent
we just of course need to update the
book to see if we
have it will take time but i will
explain later
what time it takes to do
okay here we go it done so that that i
just voted
20 tokens eating my tip 3 balance change
from 10 to 30
tokens arrived to my wallet i can
sell some of that now let's sell some
amount that's an
eight nine let's do it nine and
well what the amount i would sell let's
say 0.2
and for how long i want this to be
active this order
i can put you know two hours and
yeah let's let's do that oops
my ugly face we just wait for a message
to be executed on the devnet
it's actually several messages which is
sent out and okay
so this this message has been sent out
when it will be accepted you will see
okay here we go it's landed meaning that
the ownership of my wallet now has been
transferred to
the order book contract but just
remember
that phrase i will explain what it
really means and what's the difference
this is it we sell you can see here we
have
eight tokens to sell 0.2 we just
created an order in the order book so
okay that's kind of clear i think
right so i want to say that the order
itself
when it arrives in executing into the
order book it executes it's
in a single block it's extremely fast
and it's also settled immediately so we
are
executing and settling in one block
that's why it's called flash
exchange but i will expand on that later
and now
let me switch that to nikita and nikita
will show
how to list your token on that exchange
okay hi everyone i will
create you token in devnet
i will use talking debot it's
it's here let's start it okay
now i need to enter public key for my
account
let's copy it
okay um
that's something that it's an interface
that's not been yet implemented but
uh in the very near future you will be
able to
yeah we will be able to choose actually
you won't need to copy that from
anywhere
let's meet new token
give it the name flash
exchange
token okay
and flex
it's just a symbol for my token no
dismantles here okay
and total supply will be one million
tokens okay for now i need to transfer
at least five native tokens
to token root address
then we will continue
with the bot okay
let's check the result of this transfer
it's in progress let's wait for a few
seconds
okay i've returned to the bot and then
yes did you center it yes let's uh
again repeat okay now we need to sign
this message to deploy talking root
control
to the network message sent let's
wait for transaction okay and last step
my token was created but we need to
upload a wallet code
let's approve it again
sign this transaction
yeah so we'll create an address and then
we yeah it's done okay
okay just
the public key again
okay let's and now i can
show you that i have this token
uh not only this i have one more test
talking
and now i need to switch to
a flexed bot i think now you need to
list this token
into the into the flex exchange okay
let's start it let's restart to
reload it and start
this is my public key
uh yes i want so we need to deploy a
flex client now
so we need to send some money i guess
right
of course it's a work in progress it's
an mvp don't use it live
and there is a lot of enhancements and
refinements and refactoring that is
going on right now
okay
[Music]
now we need to sign deploy message
okay the next step to initialize
configuration
yes
okay now i need to add
to deploy trading pair for my new token
let's go switch to
[Music]
talking debate and copy the address of
my
tip yes of the root
contract yeah that will be automated in
the future
we need to send more tokens to this to
this
root address to mint more tokens
enter manually
to do it right now to transfer
some tokens too
to the root contract
okay
done okay great
great let's
update the list
of trading pairs
yeah here we go oh yeah put some tokens
on sale please
no problem
yes current account
and how many tons for example
sometime
to initialize my token wallet
for exchange okay what's next
please very clearly we need to wait a
little bit yeah for
the message to be delivered okay yeah
a little more
okay great
[Music]
grant tokens
okay grant
grant by address and enter manually
copy from here
okay how many tokens to grant for
example
ten thousand yeah something like that be
large
need more maybe fifty
okay i see let's confirm
oh great now
i'm ready to sell what should i do
just so maybe i need to update my
at least let's try i want to sell
you should obtain balance okay you need
to update this
data start
i will copy my
public key from my main account
mm-hmm uh this
yeah let's see balance
set this correct and then let's sell
for example 35
nice key
nikita is now selling our flex exchange
token please don't
run to binance with that
yet i would say
okay i need to update
update order book yeah okay
here you go give me the screen please
okay i want to buy some
so i've just started my
my d bot and i have flex
i like that but i don't have tip three
wallet yet so
i need to deploy one my account
let's put it five tokens to maintain it
and let's wait until it will be done a
couple of seconds
yeah and uh-huh
please wait a little we should wait
little
yeah it's done balance zero so now i
want to buy this token 35 000
i see someone is selling for one i think
it's a good price let's just do that i
want to buy
let's say 500 of this and yeah
that's 500 tons
which will be deducted from my account
and you know
and the tokens will be supposed to be
mine
let's see
and of course it's a demo so
something went wrong i guess
so yeah just message didn't so let's
retry it
it's done all right let's us uh
wait a little for the execution
actually for update not the execution
yeah it's done
so it's it's you can see here it's 34
500 so it's actually
executed already now we just wait for
the message for the account update
the exchange is actually being processed
so now we have 53 balance 500 that's it
so last thing i wanted is to show you
what's so significant about that in our
view so let me share another screen
and just explain how it actually works
and what's the difference between that
and any other implementation
what you have been witnessed is the
first i think distributed
order book and the thing is that
this order book doesn't work like a
usual order book on the blockchains but
that you see which has failed
every time it has been tried because the
order book can be very large
and the operations on order book are
very hard
to do so usually all the blockchain
projects that try to do the order book
contract failed
and they will fail even on town and
doesn't matter where
they will just fail you cannot create an
order book in a smart contract
doesn't matter how fast is your
blockchain
because it can have millions operations
iterations over a table and you just
cannot do that
it will be painfully slow it will not
work in a large scale it won't be
scalable
so what we have created as a distributed
order book
meaning what happens really is you have
an exchange route and it works very
similar to in the same principles and as
we're promoting
all the time in tip three tip two and
now this flex
so we create a tip three tone pair which
has a
special code and then it deploys
a price contract for every price that
you want to sell to
and this price contract is a separate
contract it doesn't have
a single order book it has just one
price
and this price is searchable by hash
so it's retrievable from the database
extremely fast to the client side but
the client side is actually operating on
the order book
there is no single order book on chain
every price
is separate in this price what it does
is when
someone is putting for example sell
orders and when the buy order arrives
it immediately executes it instantly is
a flash
execution what you have learned probably
from flash on ethereum
well it does it legally meaning that
it's it arrives and it immediately
settles in one block and it's done
and it's cleared from here so no more
when all the prices are executed
inside the price the contract destroys
itself
so when you search by the hash in the
database you will only see the contracts
that has been deployed meaning there is
some trading in there so you see the
order actually order book
immediately just by contract that is
deployed on chain
so you can immediately retrieve the the
order book and the whole logic of the
exchange is actually distributed
between the on-chain smart contracts and
off chain lite clients meaning sdks
that potentially has a almost unlimited
scalability
it can withstand whatever the blockchain
can withstand
so i gave examples some
extrapolation examples on the speeds
that it can have
like if we have um on on the whole
blockchain if we can withstand the
million operations per second
on average that means automatically that
this exchange
will work in the speeds of centralized
nyse exchange new york stock exchange
kind of speeds it has never been
achieved before
it can work as fast as and faster
actually
than binance why faster because the
settlement is also
embedded the settlement is immediate of
operation
right because on like on stock exchange
you usually wait for like 24 hours
before the settlement actually happens
so you have a trade but then the
settlement takes time
here you have a trade and the settlement
immediately in the same instance
so that's all i wanted to share and of
course again it's a work in progress
there's a lot of things we need to do
yet
it's a very first iteration of
implementation and i would like
personally to thank
andrew jogen for c plus plus contracts
of the exchange
itself and uh michael we should go for
for
debots and nikita for tip 3d bots
and raman and the surf team for
the surf course support of the of the
bots
and the sdk team which by the way this
runs on the special sdk engine release
candidate we
had to change the sdks to support this
the tip three token that we're using
here is a special token it's of course
already published it has this allowance
operation
to transfer the control of the tip3
wallet to the exchange so
yeah other than that thank you very much
thank you everyone
great work
