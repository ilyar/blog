basically one of the reasons why the
 

433
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,670
basically one of the reasons why the
retention is so low because uh there are

434
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
retention is so low because uh there are
 

435
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,430
retention is so low because uh there are
not so many features

436
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
not so many features
 

437
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,310
not so many features
like

438
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,320
like
 

439
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,430
like
i would say

440
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
i would say
 

441
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,829
i would say
in global community there is not that

442
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
in global community there is not that
 

443
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,230
in global community there is not that
many features but for chinese community

444
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
many features but for chinese community
 

445
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,110
many features but for chinese community
there are

446
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120
there are
 

447
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,030
there are
practically no features that they can

448
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
practically no features that they can
 

449
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,470
practically no features that they can
use because nothing well there are a few

450
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
use because nothing well there are a few
 

451
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,310
use because nothing well there are a few
applications translated

452
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
applications translated
 

453
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,829
applications translated
into chinese

454
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
into chinese
 

455
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,630
into chinese
and um

456
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,640
and um
 

457
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,710
and um
many of the applications kind of they do

458
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:38,720
many of the applications kind of they do
 

459
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,470
many of the applications kind of they do
not have mobile version which is also

460
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
not have mobile version which is also
 

461
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,470
not have mobile version which is also
not very user friendly

462
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,480
not very user friendly
 

463
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,069
not very user friendly
uh for the chinese users etc and

464
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
uh for the chinese users etc and
 

465
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,910
uh for the chinese users etc and
of course this is kind of this is bad if

466
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
of course this is kind of this is bad if
 

467
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,910
of course this is kind of this is bad if
we want to retain our users

468

hackathons uh tech contests etc
and qls so influencers this is also kind

686
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
and qls so influencers this is also kind
 

687
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,910
and qls so influencers this is also kind
of the most important part here

688
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:15,920
of the most important part here
 

689
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,470
of the most important part here
yeah just um

690
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
yeah just um
 

691
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,350
yeah just um
these are the kpis for one year

692
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
these are the kpis for one year
 

693
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,710
these are the kpis for one year
but uh

694
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
but uh
 

695
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,790
but uh
basically i think that it would be kind

696
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800

kind of prove that we can uh use this
funding in a wise way an effective way

712
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:48,839
funding in a wise way an effective way
 

713
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,389
funding in a wise way an effective way
to

this is kind of this reality of course
 

771
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,430
this is kind of this reality of course
kind of the decentralization and

772
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:03,440
kind of the decentralization and
 

773
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,350
kind of the decentralization and
technical uh

774
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,360
technical uh
 

775
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,750
technical uh
parameters kind of technical advantages

776
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:07,760
parameters kind of technical advantages
 

777
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,150
parameters kind of technical advantages
are also very important for um

778
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,160
are also very important for um

807
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,630
in china uh another major thing is bsn
tech contest so as i mentioned bsn is a

808

the things how we can leverage him
 

813
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,950
the things how we can leverage him
uh basically they arranged technical uh

814
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:56,960
uh basically they arranged technical uh
 

815
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,470
uh basically they arranged technical uh
contests for developers um and we

816
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:00,480
contests for developers um and we
 

817
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,669
contests for developers um and we
uh we can be part of it uh

818
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
uh we can be part of it uh
 

819
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,909
uh we can be part of it uh
basically it works like there is a

820
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:05,919
basically it works like there is a
 

821
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,750
basically it works like there is a
contest for

822
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:07,760
contest for
 

823
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,830
contest for
uh several teams who code on everscale

824
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:11,840
uh several teams who code on everscale
 

825
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,470
uh several teams who code on everscale
and uh kind of this much

826
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480
and uh kind of this much
 

827
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,950
and uh kind of this much
looks like hackathon on everscale but

828
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:16,960
looks like hackathon on everscale but
 

829
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,789
looks like hackathon on everscale but
with bsn branding

830
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
with bsn branding
 

831
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,830
with bsn branding
and with of course bsn communities for

832
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840
and with of course bsn communities for
 

833
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,029
and with of course bsn communities for
developers so this is i think one of the

834
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:25,039
developers so this is i think one of the
 

835
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:25,830
developers so this is i think one of the
first

836
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:25,840

837
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,750
first
good steps that we can make in terms of

838
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:27,760
good steps that we can make in terms of
 

839
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,630
good steps that we can make in terms of
brand awareness among developers and

000 hours just for this no actually this
 

867
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,430
000 hours just for this no actually this
funding is for achieving these goals so

868
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,440
funding is for achieving these goals so
 

869
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,549
funding is for achieving these goals so
if we

870
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:06,559
if we
 

871
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,430
if we
make a three amaze for example and we

872
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:09,440
make a three amaze for example and we
 

873
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,230
make a three amaze for example and we
see that the goal isn't achieved

874
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,240
see that the goal isn't achieved
 

875
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,510
see that the goal isn't achieved
so we try to do something else with this

876
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:15,520
so we try to do something else with this
 

877
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,990
so we try to do something else with this
funding that we have because basically

878
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,000
funding that we have because basically
 

879
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,590
funding that we have because basically
this funding is for achieving these

880
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,600
this funding is for achieving these
 

881
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,630
this funding is for achieving these
goals so yes this is

882
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:22,640
goals so yes this is
 

883
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,149
goals so yes this is
um

884
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:24,159
um
 

885
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,310
um
this is our kind of position

886
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,320
this is our kind of position
 

887
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,590
this is our kind of position
so

888
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,600
so

wonderful presentation uh there's a few
 

917
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,590
wonderful presentation uh there's a few
questions from all community members

918
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
questions from all community members
 

919
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,870
questions from all community members
they collected uh during these days

920
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
they collected uh during these days
 

921
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,470
they collected uh during these days
uh

922
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,480
uh
 

923
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,110
uh
yeah the first question is uh are you

924
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,120
yeah the first question is uh are you
 

925
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,390
yeah the first question is uh are you
planning to participate or launch uh

926
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400
planning to participate or launch uh
 

927
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,789
planning to participate or launch uh
hackathons for developers

928
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:16,799

 

929
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,510

uh you mean participate so no no

930
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,520
uh you mean participate so no no
 

931
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,350
uh you mean participate so no no
no

932
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360

 

933
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,310

well it depends because uh participate

934
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:26,320
well it depends because uh participate
 

935
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,830
well it depends because uh participate
um

936
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:27,840
um
 

937
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,149
um
uh it would it would make sense to

938
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:30,159
uh it would it would make sense to
 

939
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,110
uh it would it would make sense to
participate in hackathons as a

940
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,120
participate in hackathons as a
 

941
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,630
participate in hackathons as a
co-organizer

942
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:34,640
co-organizer
 

943
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,870
co-organizer
uh because obviously hackathons are not

944
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
uh because obviously hackathons are not
 

945
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,350
uh because obviously hackathons are not
necessarily devoted to ever skills so we

946
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,360
necessarily devoted to ever skills so we
 

947
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,909
necessarily devoted to ever skills so we
in order to promote our skill we need to

948
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:41,919
in order to promote our skill we need to
 

949
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,549
in order to promote our skill we need to
kind of bring the agenda of ever scale

950
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:44,559
kind of bring the agenda of ever scale
 

951
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,070
kind of bring the agenda of ever scale
and

952
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,080
and
 

953
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,750
and
educate

954
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:47,760
educate
 

955
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,390
educate
participants how to um

956
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
participants how to um
 

957
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,669
participants how to um
how to code on every scale and that is

958
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:53,679
how to code on every scale and that is
 

959
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,029
how to code on every scale and that is
why i would say that a bsn tech contest

960
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:57,039
why i would say that a bsn tech contest
 

961
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,430
why i would say that a bsn tech contest
is kind of the first attempt for

962
00:21:59,430 --> 00:21:59,440
is kind of the first attempt for
 

963
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,669
is kind of the first attempt for
such hackathons but in the future we'll

964
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:01,679
such hackathons but in the future we'll
 

965
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,909
such hackathons but in the future we'll
have many of them but they would require

966
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:03,919
have many of them but they would require
 

967
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,710
have many of them but they would require
additional resources because

968
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,720
additional resources because
 

969
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,669
additional resources because
well

970
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:07,679
well
 

971
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,990
well
we anyway we would need to partner with

972
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,000
we anyway we would need to partner with
 

973
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,830
we anyway we would need to partner with
some

974

some
 

975
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,230
some
existing uh tech communities uh we we

976
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,240
existing uh tech communities uh we we
 

977
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,230
existing uh tech communities uh we we
know already all of them and

978
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,240

 

979
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,390

1221
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,190

semi-decentralized blockchain so this is

1222
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,200
semi-decentralized blockchain so this is
 

1223
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,230
semi-decentralized blockchain so this is
the blockchain within inside of china

1224
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,240
the blockchain within inside of china
 

1225

00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:50,880
so basically yes this is also something
 

1727
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,109
so basically yes this is also something
that we can bring to the chinese users

1728
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:53,119
that we can bring to the chinese users
 

1729
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,430
that we can bring to the chinese users
as well but in general this is kind of a

1730
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:55,440
as well but in general this is kind of a
 

1731
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,349
as well but in general this is kind of a
hypothesis so we

1732
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:57,359
hypothesis so we
 

1733
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,950
hypothesis so we
need to test it and uh see how

1734
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:00,960
need to test it and uh see how
 

1735
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,750
need to test it and uh see how
uh

1736
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:01,760
uh
 

1737
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,990
uh
whether it will be popular among chinese

1738
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:04,000
whether it will be popular among chinese
 

1739
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,870
whether it will be popular among chinese
users because as you as you know

1740
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:06,880
users because as you as you know
 

1741
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,270
users because as you as you know
chinese users well usually

1742
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,280

1743
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,470
chinese users well usually
chinese

1744
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:10,480
chinese
 

1745
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,150
chinese
have their own chess

1746
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:12,160
have their own chess
 

1747
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,109
have their own chess
and they

1748
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:13,119
and they
 

1749
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,790
and they
pretty much different from the original

1750
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:14,800
pretty much different from the original
 

1751
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,670
pretty much different from the original
chess

1752
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:15,680

00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:20,240
yeah so basically perhaps uh there could
 

1757
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,750
yeah so basically perhaps uh there could
be kind of some
