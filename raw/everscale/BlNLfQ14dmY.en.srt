00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,990
like the update itself works well it's
uh it's the immigration from the

00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
uh it's the immigration from the
 

135
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,150
uh it's the immigration from the
previous version which is really hard to

136
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
previous version which is really hard to
 

137
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,270

created a special upgrade protocol

346
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
created a special upgrade protocol
 

347
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,469
created a special upgrade protocol
and like we want to think about that

348
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
and like we want to think about that
 

349
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,469
and like we want to think about that
ahead of time

350
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
ahead of time
 

351
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,309
ahead of time
so this protocol implementation is

352
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
so this protocol implementation is
 

353
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,790
so this protocol implementation is
ongoing and uh so it will take us like a

354
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
ongoing and uh so it will take us like a
 

355
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,350
ongoing and uh so it will take us like a
couple of weeks maybe like two to two

356
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
couple of weeks maybe like two to two
 

357
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,710
couple of weeks maybe like two to two
weeks to

358
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
weeks to
 

359
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,309
weeks to
finish the implementation of migration

360
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
finish the implementation of migration
 

361
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,390
finish the implementation of migration
protocol once it's done we will more

362
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
protocol once it's done we will more
 

363
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,350
protocol once it's done we will more

like whatever is agreed doesn't matter
someone sends money on the for the

518
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
someone sends money on the for the
 

519
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,670
someone sends money on the for the
second leg

520
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
second leg
 

521
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,670
second leg
of the deposit

522
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
of the deposit
 

523
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,990
of the deposit
and there are parameters of the locks

524
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
and there are parameters of the locks
 

525
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,710
and there are parameters of the locks
lock lock times two parameters of two

526
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
lock lock times two parameters of two
 

527
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,110
lock lock times two parameters of two
locks times one lock time is how long

528
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,120
locks times one lock time is how long
 

529
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,949
locks times one lock time is how long
you should wait until the money is

530
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
you should wait until the money is
 

531
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,430
you should wait until the money is
arriving from the community givers and

532
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
arriving from the community givers and
 

533
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,829
arriving from the community givers and
then for how long the whole thing is

534
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
then for how long the whole thing is
 

535
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,470
then for how long the whole thing is
locked right so two parameters

536
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
locked right so two parameters
 

537
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,470
locked right so two parameters
and

538
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,480
and
 

539
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,470
and
but then after this first

540
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
but then after this first
 

541
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,949
but then after this first
time is passed has passed

542
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
time is passed has passed
 

543
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,590
time is passed has passed
then this money is deployed somewhere

544
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
then this money is deployed somewhere
 

545
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,470
then this money is deployed somewhere
um

546
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
um
 

547
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,230
um
for example in in

548
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
for example in in
 

549
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,230
for example in in
the version two

550
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
the version two
 

551
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,030
the version two
version three whatever depots right the

552
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
version three whatever depots right the
 

553
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,829

the elector contract i would

554
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:31,839
the elector contract i would
 

555
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,790
the elector contract i would
uh for example so in order to do that

556
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
uh for example so in order to do that
 

557
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,509
uh for example so in order to do that
there is a there is a target contract

558
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
there is a there is a target contract
 

559
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,350
there is a there is a target contract
address set up in in dark pool and

560
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
address set up in in dark pool and
 

561
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,230
address set up in in dark pool and
then this target contract has just it's

562
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
then this target contract has just it's
 

563
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,389
then this target contract has just it's
just just an empty contract with the

564
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
just just an empty contract with the
 

565
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,030
just just an empty contract with the

566
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
with the set code function
 

567
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,910
with the set code function
so in order to like get your funds into

568
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
so in order to like get your funds into
 

569
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,389
so in order to like get your funds into
this the new contract whatever it is the

lecture whatever
the target contract is you need to

574
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
the target contract is you need to
 

575
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,870
the target contract is you need to
activate the set code but

576
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
activate the set code but
 

577
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,190
activate the set code but
who is actually need to activate this

578
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
who is actually need to activate this
 

579
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,949
who is actually need to activate this
the set code

580
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:04,959
the set code
 

581
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,030
the set code
if just developers would activate it

582
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
if just developers would activate it
 

583
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,750
if just developers would activate it
they can well not saying but it's

584
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:09,760
they can well not saying but it's
 

585
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,069
they can well not saying but it's
possible that they could be a malicious

586
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
possible that they could be a malicious
 

587
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,350
possible that they could be a malicious
attack on

588
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
attack on
 

589
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,829
attack on
on the on the code of the of the

590
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
on the on the code of the of the
 

591
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,990
on the on the code of the of the
contract that and they could for example

592
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
contract that and they could for example
 

593
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,910
contract that and they could for example
take all the money

594
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:19,920
take all the money
 

595
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,870
take all the money
so we have developed it's not entirely

596
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
so we have developed it's not entirely
 

597
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,110
so we have developed it's not entirely
part of the dark pool but it's important

598
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120
part of the dark pool but it's important
 

599
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,150
part of the dark pool but it's important
addition

600
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
addition
 

601
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,030
addition
and

602
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
and
 

603
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,310
and
what we did is we created an smb

604
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
what we did is we created an smb
 

605
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,269
what we did is we created an smb
um

606
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
um
 

607
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,790
um
smv voting

608
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
smv voting
 

609
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,750
smv voting
between all the dark poor pool members

610
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
between all the dark poor pool members
 

611
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,150
between all the dark poor pool members
to vote for the set code

612
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
to vote for the set code
 

613
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,470
to vote for the set code
and this edition was written it's done

614
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
and this edition was written it's done
 

615
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,630
and this edition was written it's done
it's ready but

616
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
it's ready but
 

617
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,910
it's ready but
so that one is just need a review which

618
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:45,920
so that one is just need a review which
 

619
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,670
so that one is just need a review which
will take uh

620
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:47,680
will take uh
 

621
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,310
will take uh
probably a week or something

622
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,320
probably a week or something
 

623
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,829
probably a week or something
and after that

624
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:51,839
and after that
 

625
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,829
and after that
then um

626
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
then um
 

627
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,230
then um
the other thing that we have been

628
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
the other thing that we have been
 

629
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,829
the other thing that we have been
developing or provender has been

630
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
developing or provender has been
 

631
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,470
developing or provender has been
developing actually is is a front end

632
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
developing actually is is a front end
 

633
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,790
developing actually is is a front end
for for dark pulse

634
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
for for dark pulse
 

635
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,829
for for dark pulse
but

636
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
but
 

637
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,030
but
that does not

638
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,040
that does not
 

639
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,990
that does not
prevent

640
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
prevent
 

641
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,269
prevent
releasing this um for

642
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:09,279
releasing this um for
 

643
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,190
releasing this um for
uh rust cup for example

644
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
uh rust cup for example
 

645
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,190
uh rust cup for example
right dark pool so

646
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,200
right dark pool so
 

647
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,030
right dark pool so
bottom line what i'm saying is that once

648
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,040
bottom line what i'm saying is that once
 

649
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,430
bottom line what i'm saying is that once
this set code part

650
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
this set code part
 

651
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,069
this set code part
set set code smv voting part is tested

652
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
set set code smv voting part is tested
 

653
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,670
set set code smv voting part is tested
we're ready to go

654
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
we're ready to go
 

655
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,750
we're ready to go
so i think and then and then it's

656
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
so i think and then and then it's
 

657
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,550
so i think and then and then it's
administrative decisions which are not

658
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
administrative decisions which are not
 

659
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,350
administrative decisions which are not
mine like that's the governance um which

660
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
mine like that's the governance um which
 

661
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,350
mine like that's the governance um which
need to take these decisions

662
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
need to take these decisions
 

663
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,990
need to take these decisions
uh the code is available i will post the

664
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000

and you can review the contracts

678
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
and you can review the contracts
 

679
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,629
and you can review the contracts
yourself there are you will see there

680

yourself there are you will see there
 

681
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,949
yourself there are you will see there
are two types of contracts one is

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
which you probably won't be able to
 

687
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,470
which you probably won't be able to
review but well you will see that it's

review but well you will see that it's
 

689
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,790
review but well you will see that it's
an ursus contract

690
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
an ursus contract
 

691
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,550
an ursus contract
and then the translation of resource

692
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
and then the translation of resource
 

693
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,069
and then the translation of resource
contracts and the solidity so there will

694
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
contracts and the solidity so there will
 

695
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,710
contracts and the solidity so there will
be ursus source code and solidity source

696
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
be ursus source code and solidity source
 

697
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,509
be ursus source code and solidity source
code

698
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
code
 

699
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,710
code
all created by preventa team and um and

700
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:16,720
all created by preventa team and um and
 

701
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,269
all created by preventa team and um and
you can review that and we will also

702

you can review that and we will also
 

703
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,949
you can review that and we will also
going to review that

704
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
going to review that
 

705
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,310
going to review that
um we'll take as i said probably a week

the sources thing i was
 

767
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,870
the sources thing i was
kind of looking forward for it for for

768

and i want just to ask will there be a
compile instructions for ourselves or

778
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
compile instructions for ourselves or
 

779
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,350
compile instructions for ourselves or
will or is it just a code which we

780
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
will or is it just a code which we
 

781
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,990
will or is it just a code which we
cannot touch and change yeah nothing

782
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
cannot touch and change yeah nothing
 

783
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,350
cannot touch and change yeah nothing
nothing at this point it is not a

784
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:53,360
nothing at this point it is not a
 

785
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,030
nothing at this point it is not a
release of forces

786
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
release of forces
 

787
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,629
release of forces
but the just the release of source code

788
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639
but the just the release of source code
 

789
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,470
but the just the release of source code

um their ursus uh is still in

792
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,120
um their ursus uh is still in
 

793
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,030
um their ursus uh is still in
development and there is no

794
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040
development and there is no
 

795
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,470
development and there is no
documentation so like it's an inhuman

code by itself as a human

800
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:10,639
code by itself as a human
 

801
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,790
code by itself as a human
and without any instructions it's uh

802
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:12,800
and without any instructions it's uh
 

803
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,430
and without any instructions it's uh
it's kind of in human inhuman

804
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
it's kind of in human inhuman
 

805
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,350
it's kind of in human inhuman
in uh well

806
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
in uh well
 

807
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,829
in uh well
exponentially inhuman

808
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
exponentially inhuman
 

809
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,710
exponentially inhuman
i don't know so we should wait until um

810
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:22,720
i don't know so we should wait until um
 

811
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,310
i don't know so we should wait until um
until prevent the team

812
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320
until prevent the team
 

813
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,430
until prevent the team
finds time to kind of um

814
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
finds time to kind of um
 

815
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,790
finds time to kind of um
make that more

816
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
make that more
 

817
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,870
make that more
developer friendly i would say

818
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880
developer friendly i would say
 

819
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,189
developer friendly i would say
but nevertheless it's written in ursus

820
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,199
but nevertheless it's written in ursus
 

821
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,430
but nevertheless it's written in ursus
it's the first actually production ready

822
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
it's the first actually production ready
 

823
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,670
it's the first actually production ready
system which is written in orsos i think

824
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
system which is written in orsos i think
 

825
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,069
system which is written in orsos i think
by just that is already i think quite

826
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
by just that is already i think quite
 

827
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,069
by just that is already i think quite
important step

828
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079
important step
 

829
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,870
important step
yeah

830
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:42,880

841
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,670
explain to me like a non-techie guy uh
why don't we need an extra language like

842
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
why don't we need an extra language like
 

843
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,870
why don't we need an extra language like
it's versus here well we have c plus

844
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
it's versus here well we have c plus
 

845
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,829
it's versus here well we have c plus

basement cortex so we are introducing a

850
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:06,800
basement cortex so we are introducing a
 

851
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,389
basement cortex so we are introducing a
third language

852
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
third language
 

853
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,949
third language
which will like you know won't make the

854
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
which will like you know won't make the
 

855
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,949
which will like you know won't make the
life of the developers easier so what's

856
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:12,959
life of the developers easier so what's
 

857
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,749
life of the developers easier so what's
the concept on behind this thank you yes

858
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
the concept on behind this thank you yes
 

859
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,949
the concept on behind this thank you yes
sure

860
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:16,959
sure
 

861
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,030
sure
well first of all i'm not the person who

862
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,040
well first of all i'm not the person who
 

863
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,350
well first of all i'm not the person who
really need to speak about ursus

864
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
really need to speak about ursus
 

865
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,550
really need to speak about ursus
and we may but once it's ready to go for

866
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560
and we may but once it's ready to go for
 

867
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,030
and we may but once it's ready to go for
developers adoption where we're going to

868
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
developers adoption where we're going to
 

869
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,350
developers adoption where we're going to
of course uh like um

870
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,360
of course uh like um
 

871

languages courses cannot be regarded as
well it's high level language but

886
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
well it's high level language but
 

887
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,069
well it's high level language but
it's very specialized language

888
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
it's very specialized language
 

889
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,069
it's very specialized language
ursus is by itself translated into

890
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
ursus is by itself translated into

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,470
ursus is by itself translated into
solidity so you need to remember that so

892
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480
solidity so you need to remember that so
 

893
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,829
solidity so you need to remember that so
it's a kind of

894
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:57,839
it's a kind of
 

895
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:58,629
it's a kind of
up

896
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
up
 

897
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,629

from that depends on what you're looking

900
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:02,480
from that depends on what you're looking
 

901
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,509
from that depends on what you're looking
for

902
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
for
 

903
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,710
for
the reason

904
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:04,720
the reason
 

905
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,990
the reason
for developing ursus is to develop a

906
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,000
for developing ursus is to develop a
 

907
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,630
for developing ursus is to develop a
language which will be

908
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:10,640
language which will be
 

909
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,990
language which will be
uh which will be

910
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000

 

911
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,909

formally verified in verifiable kind of

912
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:17,919
formally verified in verifiable kind of
 

913
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,150
formally verified in verifiable kind of
easily by design

914
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,160
easily by design
 

915
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,029
easily by design
so when you write a contract on ursus

916
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:23,039
so when you write a contract on ursus
 

917
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,710
so when you write a contract on ursus
it takes

918
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720
it takes
 

919
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,309
it takes
basically if you look at the formal

920
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:26,319
basically if you look at the formal
 

921
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,430
basically if you look at the formal
verification process right now which uh

922
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:29,440
verification process right now which uh
 

923
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,789
verification process right now which uh
which we're developing and you know

924
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:30,799
which we're developing and you know
 

925
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,789
which we're developing and you know
every scale is one of the leading if not

926
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
every scale is one of the leading if not
 

927
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,950
every scale is one of the leading if not
the leading i think actually the leading

928
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
the leading i think actually the leading
 

929
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,029
the leading i think actually the leading
blockchain and formal verification

930
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
blockchain and formal verification
 

931
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,470
blockchain and formal verification
currently

932
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,480
currently
 

933
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,990
currently
and

934
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,000
and
 

935
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,909
and
the provenda approach prevent the team

936
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
the provenda approach prevent the team
 

937
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:42,950
the provenda approach prevent the team
approach

938
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960
approach
 

939
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,310
approach
is to actually

940
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,320
is to actually
 

941
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,710
is to actually
instead of taking the smart contract and

942
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
instead of taking the smart contract and
 

943
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,029
instead of taking the smart contract and
going through the whole process of

944
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:51,039
going through the whole process of
 

945
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,669
going through the whole process of
manually formally verified which is very

946
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:53,679
manually formally verified which is very
 

947
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,710
manually formally verified which is very
very hard very long process

948
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:56,720
very hard very long process
 

949
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,710
very hard very long process
so andrew came up with this

950
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:58,720
so andrew came up with this
 

951
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,470
so andrew came up with this
language which

952
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
language which
 

953
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,830
language which
is actually

954
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:01,840
is actually
 

955
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,310
is actually
you take what they do right now is they

956
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
you take what they do right now is they
 

957
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,190
you take what they do right now is they
take solidity or c plus plus contracts

958
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
take solidity or c plus plus contracts
 

959
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,990
take solidity or c plus plus contracts
and they write them in ursus

960
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,000
and they write them in ursus
 

961
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,310
and they write them in ursus
instead of translating them into

962
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,320
instead of translating them into
 

963
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,870
instead of translating them into
theorems on on

964
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
theorems on on
 

965
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,950
theorems on on
they write them

966
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
they write them
 

967
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,350
they write them
inorso's language

968
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,360
inorso's language
 

969
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,470
inorso's language
and then

970
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:20,480
and then
 

971
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,110
and then
and then because ursus is actually

972
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,120
and then because ursus is actually
 

973
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,549
and then because ursus is actually
in a way

974
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:24,559
in a way
 

975
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,830
in a way
so then they use this to prove

976
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:27,840
so then they use this to prove
 

977
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,350
so then they use this to prove
in

978
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,360
in
 

979
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,390
in
okay

980
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,400
okay
 

981
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,710
okay
and um

982
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:32,720
and um
 

983
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,150
and um
that just shortened the process

984
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:34,160
that just shortened the process
 

985
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,590
that just shortened the process
tremendously

986
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:35,600
tremendously
 

987
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,549
tremendously
like it

988
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:36,559
like it
 

989
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,870
like it
really it's like it makes the process of

990
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,880
really it's like it makes the process of
 

991
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,830
really it's like it makes the process of
formal verification

992
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:40,840
formal verification
 

993
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,070
formal verification
um like really really

994
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,080
um like really really
 

995
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,630
um like really really
like ten times easier

996
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
like ten times easier
 

997
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,549
like ten times easier
all right but doesn't it make the

998
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:48,559
all right but doesn't it make the
 

999
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,350
all right but doesn't it make the
development uh a bit no it does not

1000
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,360
development uh a bit no it does not
 

1001
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,750
development uh a bit no it does not
harder it is not making development

1002
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:53,760
harder it is not making development
 

1003
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,750
harder it is not making development
easier it is making formal verification

1004
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
easier it is making formal verification
 

1005
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,909
easier it is making formal verification
easier so

1006
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:57,919
easier so
 

1007
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,549
easier so
michael not everything that you do

1008
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:00,559
michael not everything that you do
 

1009
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,070
michael not everything that you do
in engineering

1010
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,080
in engineering
 

1011
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,710
in engineering
is you do just to make it easier

1012
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:04,720
is you do just to make it easier
 

1013
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,950
is you do just to make it easier
sometimes you also make it

1014
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:06,960
sometimes you also make it
 

1015
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,150
sometimes you also make it
better

1016
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
better
 

1017
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,750
better
or safer

1018
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
or safer
 

1019
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,390
or safer
or faster and so on and it's always a

1020
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:12,400
or faster and so on and it's always a
 

1021
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,669
or faster and so on and it's always a
compromise

1022
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:13,679
compromise
 

1023
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,190
compromise
so i apologize

1024
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
so i apologize
 

1025
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,070
so i apologize
yeah

1026
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,080
yeah
 

1027
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,190
yeah
that's just one ten seconds so ursus is

1028
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,200
that's just one ten seconds so ursus is
 

1029
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,310
that's just one ten seconds so ursus is
to make it safer not easier to make it

1030
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,320
to make it safer not easier to make it

bottom line is if you write a contract
 

1037
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,950

that is going to hold billion

1038

i think

1042
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:35,760
i think
 

1043
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,590
i think
for you it's better to write it in order

1044
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
for you it's better to write it in order

to go to formal verification someone
 

1051
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,070
to go to formal verification someone
will rewrite it in our source just to

will rewrite it in our source just to
 

1053

will rewrite it in our source just to
make it easier to formally verify that's

so let's talk about the token

1368
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:50,400
so let's talk about the token
 

1369
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,990
so let's talk about the token
from the

1370
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,000
from the
 

1371
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,510
from the

on the market
 

1977
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,710
on the market
uh is that

1978
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:46,720
uh is that
 

1979
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,230
uh is that
we

1980
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,240
we
 

1981
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,870
we
do not have a private key so our wallet

1982
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:50,880
do not have a private key so our wallet
 

1983
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,109
do not have a private key so our wallet
is keyless we use this smpc secure

1984
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:53,119
is keyless we use this smpc secure
 

1985
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,510
is keyless we use this smpc secure
motivated computation for that

1986
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:55,520
motivated computation for that
 

1987
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,310
motivated computation for that
and instead of a private key we have uh

1988
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:58,320
and instead of a private key we have uh
 

1989
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,270
and instead of a private key we have uh
two independent secrets one is generated

1990
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:01,280
two independent secrets one is generated
 

1991
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,270
two independent secrets one is generated
on the user's device for instance here

1992
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,280
on the user's device for instance here
 

1993
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,910
on the user's device for instance here
it's my mobile phone and it wasn't as

1994
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:05,920
it's my mobile phone and it wasn't as
 

1995
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,310
it's my mobile phone and it wasn't as
the other one stored stored on the side

1996
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:08,320
the other one stored stored on the side
 

1997
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,310
the other one stored stored on the side
of a server it could be for instance for

1998
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:10,320
of a server it could be for instance for
 

1999
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,710
of a server it could be for instance for
this wallet it's patient server

2000
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:12,720
this wallet it's patient server
 

2001
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,109
this wallet it's patient server
uh and as well as it could be the server

2002
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:15,119
uh and as well as it could be the server
 

2003

the seed phrase that no one loves
 

2035
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,470
the seed phrase that no one loves
uh however we decided it's really hard

2036
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:52,480
uh however we decided it's really hard

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,510
uh however we decided it's really hard
for the majority to use the seat phrases

for the majority to use the seat phrases
 

2039
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,470
for the majority to use the seat phrases
and qr codes and we are aiming directly

things work
 

2047
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,950
things work
and that's why we partnered and created

we call it synonymous because at the end

2056
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:16,960
we call it synonymous because at the end

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,550
we call it synonymous because at the end
of the day we do not store any private

2058
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:18,560
of the day we do not store any private
 

2059
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,390
of the day we do not store any private
data of the user

2060
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:20,400
data of the user
 

2061
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,109
data of the user
so we do not store any face images

2062
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:23,119
so we do not store any face images
 

2063
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,150
so we do not store any face images
as well as videos or embeddings like the

2064
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,160
as well as videos or embeddings like the
 

2065
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,030
as well as videos or embeddings like the
personal space features let me show how

2066
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,040
personal space features let me show how
 

2067
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,670
personal space features let me show how
the biometrics things work

2068
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:35,680

 

2069
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,750

so it's quite similar to the face id

2070
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:37,760
so it's quite similar to the face id
 

2071
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,870
so it's quite similar to the face id
experience

2072

experience
 

2073
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,550
experience
so what i need to do so you can see my

2074
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:40,560
so what i need to do so you can see my
 

2075
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,950
so what i need to do so you can see my
face right even right now

2076
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:42,960
face right even right now
 

2077
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,190
face right even right now
so what i need to do is to cover the

2078
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,200
so what i need to do is to cover the
 

2079
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,470
so what i need to do is to cover the
circle

2080
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:46,480
circle
 

2081
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,870

00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:48,880
by rotating my head
 

2083
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,510
by rotating my head
and that's mainly it so currently we a

2084
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:51,520
and that's mainly it so currently we a
 

2085
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,310
and that's mainly it so currently we a

and for this purpose what's also special
 

2149
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,550
and for this purpose what's also special
about our project is since we are using

about our project is since we are using
 

2151
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,910
about our project is since we are using
this mpc scheme we are able to perform

00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:07,920
this mpc scheme we are able to perform
 

2153
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,270
this mpc scheme we are able to perform
breach like

2154
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:09,280
breach like
 

2155
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,710
breach like
almost instantly without the need of

any smart contracts or etc
 

2161
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,270
any smart contracts or etc
so in this case all the cryptographic

2162
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:19,280
so in this case all the cryptographic
 

2163
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,150
so in this case all the cryptographic
part will be made of chain and we'll be

2164
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:22,160
part will be made of chain and we'll be
 

2165
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,030
part will be made of chain and we'll be
able to make a breach from any currency

2166
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,040
able to make a breach from any currency
 

2167
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,550
able to make a breach from any currency
if you have a liquidity provider of

so and the like here the cryptography as

2172
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:33,920
so and the like here the cryptography as
 

2173
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,990
so and the like here the cryptography as
well as the off chain like services will

2174
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,000
well as the off chain like services will
 

2175
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,030
well as the off chain like services will
be

2176

00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:39,839
like responsible for this kind of things
 

2179
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,670
like responsible for this kind of things
so apart from that as i told you

2180
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:41,680
so apart from that as i told you
 

2181
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,670
so apart from that as i told you
previously so we are doing white label

2182
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:43,680
previously so we are doing white label
 

2183
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,750
previously so we are doing white label
wait label things so currently we've

2184
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:45,760
wait label things so currently we've
 

2185
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,829
wait label things so currently we've
already launched the

00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:13,040
this is a question from community so
 

2355
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,109
this is a question from community so
yeah this is not by me just throw it in

2356
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:15,119
yeah this is not by me just throw it in
 

2357
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:23,190
yeah this is not by me just throw it in
grant program chat we have already

2358
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:23,200

 

2359
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,150

please

2360
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:24,160
please
 

2361
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,230
please
yes hi thank you i don't think correctly

2362
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:26,240
yes hi thank you i don't think correctly
 

2363
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,309
yes hi thank you i don't think correctly
that that neural neural network which

2364
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:28,319
that that neural neural network which
 

2365
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,910
that that neural neural network which
you uh mentioned which will drive the

2366
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:31,920
you uh mentioned which will drive the
 

2367
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,790
you uh mentioned which will drive the
user's side um

2368
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:34,800
user's side um
 

2369
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,550
user's side um
part of the secret uh

2370
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:36,560
part of the secret uh
 

2371
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,550
part of the secret uh
that that neural network operates on

2372
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:38,560
that that neural network operates on
 

2373
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,349
that that neural network operates on
your server

2374
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:41,359

 

2375
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,030

locally

2376
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:43,040
locally
 

2377
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,190
locally
yeah yeah i got it that's an awesome

2378
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:45,200
yeah yeah i got it that's an awesome
 

2379
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,390
yeah yeah i got it that's an awesome
question in fact

2380
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:46,400
question in fact
 

2381
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,270
question in fact
so currently it's uh the neural network

2382
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:49,280
so currently it's uh the neural network
 

2383
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,230
so currently it's uh the neural network
as well as all the biometric part is uh

2384
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:52,240
as well as all the biometric part is uh
 

2385
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,349
as well as all the biometric part is uh
performed at the third party service

2386
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:55,359
performed at the third party service
 

2387
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,829
performed at the third party service
so what we want to do uh and we do

2388
00:45:57,829 --> 00:45:57,839
so what we want to do uh and we do
 

2389
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,150
so what we want to do uh and we do
understand the risk there is a certain

2390
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:00,160
understand the risk there is a certain
 

2391
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,950
understand the risk there is a certain
risk of a

2392
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:02,960
risk of a
 

2393
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,630
risk of a
singular provider

2394
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:04,640
singular provider
 

2395
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,990
singular provider
one provider

2396
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:06,000
one provider
 

2397
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,910
one provider
and for these purposes

2398
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:07,920
and for these purposes
 

2399
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,470
and for these purposes
this like a subject of another project

2400
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:10,480
this like a subject of another project
 

2401
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,829
this like a subject of another project
of ours

2402
00:46:11,829 --> 00:46:11,839
of ours
 

2403
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,630
of ours
and of our close partners which are

2404
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:14,640
and of our close partners which are
 

2405
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,630
and of our close partners which are
sword so uh in these terms uh what we do

2406
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:18,640
sword so uh in these terms uh what we do
 

2407
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,030
sword so uh in these terms uh what we do
have like in our roadmap

2408
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:21,040
have like in our roadmap
 

2409
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,430
have like in our roadmap
is to create a decentralized network for

2410
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:23,440
is to create a decentralized network for
 

2411
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,309
is to create a decentralized network for
that

2412
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:24,319
that
 

2413
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,710
that
uh maybe use some sort of

2414
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:26,720
uh maybe use some sort of
 

2415
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,550
uh maybe use some sort of
already

2416
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:28,560
already
 

2417
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,430
already
existing systems in these terms in order

2418
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:31,440
existing systems in these terms in order
 

2419
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,630
existing systems in these terms in order
to make the distribu uh distributed

2420
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:34,640
to make the distribu uh distributed
 

2421
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,190
to make the distribu uh distributed
processing of the biometrics

2422
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:37,200
processing of the biometrics
 

2423
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,990
processing of the biometrics
because when we speak about the storage

2424
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:40,000
because when we speak about the storage
 

2425
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,870
because when we speak about the storage
of the like of the final neural network

2426
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:42,880
of the like of the final neural network
 

2427
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,309
of the like of the final neural network
uh so it's not a sensitive data so it

2428
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:46,319
uh so it's not a sensitive data so it
 

2429
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,710
uh so it's not a sensitive data so it
can be stored publicly uh the key

2430
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:48,720
can be stored publicly uh the key
 

2431
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,190
can be stored publicly uh the key
question is here however in terms of

2432
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:51,200
question is here however in terms of
 

2433
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,430
question is here however in terms of
processing so the protestants should be

2434
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:53,440
processing so the protestants should be
 

2435
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,589
processing so the protestants should be
anonymous and distributed and that's

2436
00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:55,599
anonymous and distributed and that's
 

2437
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,829
anonymous and distributed and that's
what we have in our current roadmap and

2438
00:46:57,829 --> 00:46:57,839
what we have in our current roadmap and
 

2439
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,750
what we have in our current roadmap and
that's what we are working on so in

2440
00:46:59,750 --> 00:46:59,760
that's what we are working on so in
 

2441
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,470
that's what we are working on so in
order to like to mitigate risks here so

2442
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:02,480
order to like to mitigate risks here so
 

2443
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,990
order to like to mitigate risks here so
currently it's performed on the side of

2444
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,000
currently it's performed on the side of
 

2445
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,069
currently it's performed on the side of
a third party

2446
00:47:06,069 --> 00:47:06,079
a third party
 

2447
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,230
a third party
okay and another question uh what the

2448
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:08,240
okay and another question uh what the
 

2449
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,630
okay and another question uh what the
size and bits of that user side secret

2450
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:12,640
size and bits of that user side secret
 

2451
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,150
size and bits of that user side secret
uh that's

2452
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:14,160
uh that's
 

2453
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,670
uh that's
uh

2454
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:15,680
uh
 

2455
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,030
uh
i'm not

2456
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:17,040
i'm not
 

2457
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,910
i'm not
i do not really remember but it's no

2458
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:19,920
i do not really remember but it's no
 

2459
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,589
i do not really remember but it's no
no

2460
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:21,599
no
 

2461
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,790
no
it's not it's takes not quite much

2462
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:24,800
it's not it's takes not quite much
 

2463
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,510
it's not it's takes not quite much
amount of data storage capacity if i'm

2464
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:27,520
amount of data storage capacity if i'm
 

2465
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,870
amount of data storage capacity if i'm
not mistaken it's around 30 or 32 uh

2466
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:30,880
not mistaken it's around 30 or 32 uh
 

2467
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,349
not mistaken it's around 30 or 32 uh
kilobytes

2468
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:33,359
kilobytes
 

2469
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:37,109
kilobytes
but i can clarify that

2470
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:37,119

 

2471
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,990

this is it size of secret i mean then i

2472
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:40,000
this is it size of secret i mean then i
 

2473
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,750
this is it size of secret i mean then i
don't think it's possible to

2474
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:41,760
don't think it's possible to
 

2475
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,910
don't think it's possible to
uh no it's such such long secret uh

2476
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:45,920
uh no it's such such long secret uh
 

2477
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,750
uh no it's such such long secret uh
for

2478
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:47,760
for
 

2479
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,790
for
a face

2480
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:48,800
a face
 

2481
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,069
a face
uh so if you if for example if you do it

2482
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:52,079
uh so if you if for example if you do it
 

2483
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,549
uh so if you if for example if you do it
second time you should get exactly the

2484
00:47:54,549 --> 00:47:54,559
second time you should get exactly the
 

2485
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,030
second time you should get exactly the
same secret

2486
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:57,040
same secret
 

2487
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,109
same secret
so i think that the final secret should

2488
00:47:59,109 --> 00:47:59,119
so i think that the final secret should
 

2489
00:47:59,119 --> 00:47:59,910
so i think that the final secret should
be

2490
00:47:59,910 --> 00:47:59,920
be
 

2491
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,710
be
less than

2492
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:02,720
less than
 

2493
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,710
less than
the amount you set

2494
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:04,720
the amount you set
 

2495
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,430
the amount you set
yeah so uh i was talking maybe uh i got

2496
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:07,440
yeah so uh i was talking maybe uh i got
 

2497
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,510
yeah so uh i was talking maybe uh i got
a bit confused or confused you i was

2498
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:09,520
a bit confused or confused you i was
 

2499
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,589
a bit confused or confused you i was
talking about the neural networks that

2500
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:11,599
talking about the neural networks that
 

2501
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:12,710
talking about the neural networks that
we store

2502
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:12,720
we store
 

2503
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,109
we store
uh some of that

2504
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:15,119
uh some of that
 

2505
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,829
uh some of that
neural networks finally generates uh

2506
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:17,839
neural networks finally generates uh
 

2507
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,950
neural networks finally generates uh
some user side secret which yeah yeah

2508
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:20,960
some user side secret which yeah yeah
 

2509
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,670
some user side secret which yeah yeah
device then holds so the question is

2510
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:23,680
device then holds so the question is
 

2511
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:29,109
device then holds so the question is
what the size of that user side secret

2512
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:29,119

 

2513
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,510

i don't really remember that so it's

2514
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:31,520
i don't really remember that so it's
 

2515
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,309
i don't really remember that so it's
more of a tactical question if you want

2516
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:34,319
more of a tactical question if you want
 

2517
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,710
more of a tactical question if you want
to i can like provide it within a few

2518
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:36,720
to i can like provide it within a few
 

2519
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,589
to i can like provide it within a few
minutes

2520
00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:37,599

only talks about acting not really

2526
00:48:44,069 --> 00:48:44,079
only talks about acting not really
 

2527

only talks about acting not really
familiar with that

2528
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:45,680
familiar with that
 

2529
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,190
familiar with that
yes yeah but you understand the

2530
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:47,200
yes yeah but you understand the
 

2531
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,549
yes yeah but you understand the
importance of this question yeah yeah

2532
00:48:50,549 --> 00:48:50,559

 

2533
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,549

yeah it depends how many

2534
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:52,559
yeah it depends how many
 

2535
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:53,670
yeah it depends how many
uh

uh
like

2538
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:54,480
like
 

2539
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,309
like
if it is quite small then

2540
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:56,319
if it is quite small then
 

2541
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,430
if it is quite small then
you cannot differentiate or you can even

2542
00:48:59,430 --> 00:48:59,440
you cannot differentiate or you can even
 

2543

00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:13,440
not enough bits then you can i mean your
 

2553
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,230
not enough bits then you can i mean your
like

2554
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:14,240

the amount of

2572
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:33,200
the amount of
 

2573
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,790
the amount of
of the data

2574
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:34,800

2575
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,870
of the data
the secret consists of

2576
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:36,880
the secret consists of
 

2577
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,470
the secret consists of
security bits yes

2578
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:38,480
security bits yes
 

2579
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,829
security bits yes
yeah yeah security bits okay

2580
00:49:41,829 --> 00:49:41,839
yeah yeah security bits okay
 

2581
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,190
yeah yeah security bits okay
thank you thank you very much we have

2582
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:43,200
thank you thank you very much we have
 

2583
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,390
thank you thank you very much we have
another question mita though

2584
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:46,400

 

2585
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,270

yeah hi very interesting uh

2586
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:49,280
yeah hi very interesting uh
 

2587
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,549
yeah hi very interesting uh
great great work i think um is it is it

2588
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:52,559
great great work i think um is it is it
 

2589
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:53,670
great great work i think um is it is it
mpc

2590
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:53,680
mpc
 

2591
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,309
mpc
uh like um or a two-party computation

2592
00:49:58,309 --> 00:49:58,319
uh like um or a two-party computation
 

2593
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,910
uh like um or a two-party computation
uh so yes we have like uh it's snpc but

2594
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:01,920
uh so yes we have like uh it's snpc but
 

2595
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,270
uh so yes we have like uh it's snpc but
we have currently only two secrets

2596
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:05,280
we have currently only two secrets
 

2597
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,710
we have currently only two secrets
so uh scheme we do have plans to like

2598
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:08,720
so uh scheme we do have plans to like
 

2599
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,910
so uh scheme we do have plans to like
add

2600
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:09,920
add
 

2601
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,710
add
additional cosigners to that so to

2602
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:12,720
additional cosigners to that so to
 

2603
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,710
additional cosigners to that so to
increase the amount of signers there

2604
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:14,720
increase the amount of signers there
 

2605
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,230
increase the amount of signers there
however it's still in role map so

2606
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:16,240
however it's still in role map so
 

2607
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,910
however it's still in role map so
currently it's two

2608
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:17,920
currently it's two
 

2609
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,069
currently it's two
yeah because two-party is a different

2610
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:20,079
yeah because two-party is a different
 

2611
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,510
yeah because two-party is a different
protocol as i understand from the

2612
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:21,520
protocol as i understand from the
 

2613
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,990
protocol as i understand from the
multi-party computation it's actually

2614
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:24,000
multi-party computation it's actually
 

2615
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,950
multi-party computation it's actually
not the

2616
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:24,960
not the
 

2617
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,630
not the
of this like it's it's a it's a

2618
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:26,640
of this like it's it's a it's a
 

2619
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,710
of this like it's it's a it's a
different protocol but yeah i understand

2620
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:28,720
different protocol but yeah i understand
 

2621
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,150
different protocol but yeah i understand
if you have two parties here i

2622
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:30,160
if you have two parties here i
 

2623
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,190
if you have two parties here i
understand

2624
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:31,200
understand
 

2625
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,030
understand
um

2626
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:33,040
um
 

2627
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,390
um
yeah

2628
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:34,400
yeah
 

2629
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,870
yeah
the the question of course of the of the

2630
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:36,880
the the question of course of the of the
 

2631
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,270
the the question of course of the of the
i mean you cannot compute as far as i

2632
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:39,280
i mean you cannot compute as far as i
 

2633
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,190
i mean you cannot compute as far as i
understand you cannot compute on the

2634
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:41,200
understand you cannot compute on the
 

2635
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,670
understand you cannot compute on the
user device um

2636
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:43,680
user device um
 

2637
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,750
user device um
because it's just too

2638
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:45,760
because it's just too
 

2639
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,670
because it's just too
like you re it requires too many

2640
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:47,680
like you re it requires too many
 

2641
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,190
like you re it requires too many
resources

2642
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:49,200
resources
 

2643
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,470
resources
so

2644
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:50,480
so
 

2645
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,870
so
in the future like how do you really

2646
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:52,880
in the future like how do you really
 

2647
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,390
in the future like how do you really
it's like extension to the pavel's

2648
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:54,400
it's like extension to the pavel's
 

2649
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,549
it's like extension to the pavel's
question i think how do you are you

2650
00:50:56,549 --> 00:50:56,559
question i think how do you are you
 

2651
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,030
question i think how do you are you
going to use the server all the time

2652
00:50:59,030 --> 00:50:59,040
going to use the server all the time
 

2653
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,549
going to use the server all the time
and just distribute the servers or

2654
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:02,559
and just distribute the servers or
 

2655
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,950
and just distribute the servers or
how because you cannot compute it on the

2656
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:04,960
how because you cannot compute it on the
 

2657
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,710
how because you cannot compute it on the
on the phone right

2658
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:06,720
on the phone right
 

2659
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,510
on the phone right
or it will take a long time

2660
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:09,520
or it will take a long time
 

2661
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,870
or it will take a long time
or or am i missing something

2662
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:12,880
or or am i missing something
 

2663
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,349
or or am i missing something
yeah what we also have in plans in these

2664
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:15,359
yeah what we also have in plans in these
 

2665
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,630
yeah what we also have in plans in these
terms is uh if you speak about the

2666
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:18,640
terms is uh if you speak about the
 

2667
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,790
terms is uh if you speak about the
second secret yeah the ones that start

2668
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:20,800
second secret yeah the ones that start
 

2669
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,670
second secret yeah the ones that start
on the spatium side

2670
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:23,680
on the spatium side
 

2671
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:29,030
on the spatium side
we do have plans to use some sort of

2672
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:29,040

 

2673
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,069

like

2674
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:30,079
like
 

2675
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,390
like
other networks that will be in

2676
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:32,400
other networks that will be in
 

2677
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,829
other networks that will be in
that will be

2678
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:33,839
that will be
 

2679
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,430
that will be
performing that will perform the

2680
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:35,440
performing that will perform the
 

2681
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,790
performing that will perform the
calculations uh in this respect so we

2682
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:38,800
calculations uh in this respect so we
 

2683
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,270
calculations uh in this respect so we
are looking for at like secret network

2684
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:41,280
are looking for at like secret network
 

2685
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,270
are looking for at like secret network
and etc which will be performing the

2686
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:43,280
and etc which will be performing the
 

2687
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,430
and etc which will be performing the
decentralized like processing parts so

2688
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:45,440
decentralized like processing parts so
 

2689
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,990
decentralized like processing parts so
we will like eliminate the provider sync

2690
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:50,000
we will like eliminate the provider sync
 

2691
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,230
we will like eliminate the provider sync
so in order to eliminate the risk of the

2692
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:52,240
so in order to eliminate the risk of the
 

2693
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,349
so in order to eliminate the risk of the
loss of the second secret of the frozen

2694
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:55,359
loss of the second secret of the frozen
 

2695
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:58,470
loss of the second secret of the frozen
like the frozen of the server side we

2696
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:58,480
like the frozen of the server side we
 

2697
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,589
like the frozen of the server side we
also have in our roadmap the scroll part

2698
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:01,599
also have in our roadmap the scroll part
 

2699
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,990
also have in our roadmap the scroll part
so it's like a guarantor option the one

2700
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:04,000
so it's like a guarantor option the one
 

2701
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,190
so it's like a guarantor option the one
who will uh like store both

2702
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:07,200
who will uh like store both
 

2703
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,910
who will uh like store both
secrets encrypted uh with each other it

2704
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:09,920
secrets encrypted uh with each other it
 

2705
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,309
secrets encrypted uh with each other it
can be a custodian one so for instance

2706
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:12,319
can be a custodian one so for instance
 

2707
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:15,349
can be a custodian one so for instance
if the user or like

2708
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:15,359
if the user or like
 

2709
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,230
if the user or like
wants to like leave the system you can

2710
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:18,240
wants to like leave the system you can
 

2711
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,109
wants to like leave the system you can
grab the second secret uh from the

2712
00:52:21,109 --> 00:52:21,119
grab the second secret uh from the
 

2713
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,270
grab the second secret uh from the
custodianship and like restore the

2714
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:23,280
custodianship and like restore the
 

2715
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,270
custodianship and like restore the
private key with that

2716
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:25,280
private key with that
 

2717
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,190
private key with that
uh so in fact that's

2718
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:27,200
uh so in fact that's
 

2719
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,430
uh so in fact that's
the questions you that you're asking are

2720
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:29,440
the questions you that you're asking are
 

2721
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,670
the questions you that you're asking are
quite the ones that we want to address

2722
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:31,680
quite the ones that we want to address
 

2723
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,670
quite the ones that we want to address
and are seeking to address

2724
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:33,680
and are seeking to address
 

2725
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,549
and are seeking to address
in the long run uh i believe

2726
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:36,559
in the long run uh i believe

00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:38,800
here i would be pleased that we have
 

2729
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,190
here i would be pleased that we have
like guys from a tech team to answer

2730
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:41,200
like guys from a tech team to answer
 

2731
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,589
like guys from a tech team to answer
them like in depth because i'm more

2732
00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:43,599
them like in depth because i'm more
 

2733
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,069
them like in depth because i'm more
about about the product rather than the

custodian and servers and
 

2763
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,670
custodian and servers and
all of that and you know

2764
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:19,680
all of that and you know
 

2765
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,030
all of that and you know
in fact what we had in like in our early

2766
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:23,040
in fact what we had in like in our early
 

2767
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,150
in fact what we had in like in our early
stage

2768
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:24,160
stage
 

2769
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,790
stage
uh first of all when spatial was created

2770
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:26,800
uh first of all when spatial was created
 

2771
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,030
uh first of all when spatial was created
we do not have we do not have like a

2772
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:29,040
we do not have we do not have like a
 

2773
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,549
we do not have we do not have like a
server component

2774
00:53:30,549 --> 00:53:30,559
server component
 

2775
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,309
server component
we had two devices

2776
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:32,319
we had two devices
 

2777
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,950
we had two devices
so we were using like two devices to

2778
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:34,960
so we were using like two devices to
 

2779
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,069
so we were using like two devices to
perform like a signature so we still had

2780
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:38,079
perform like a signature so we still had
 

2781
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,910
perform like a signature so we still had
the smpc there

2782
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:39,920
the smpc there
 

2783
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,990
the smpc there
however one secret was located for

2784
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:42,000
however one secret was located for
 

2785
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,309
however one secret was located for
instance one my mobile phone and the

2786
00:53:44,309 --> 00:53:44,319
instance one my mobile phone and the
 

2787
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,950
instance one my mobile phone and the
other was on for instance the

2788
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:46,960
other was on for instance the
 

2789
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,549
other was on for instance the
apple watch

2790
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:48,559
apple watch
 

2791
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,750
apple watch
so and i was like co-signing the

2792
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:51,760
so and i was like co-signing the
 

2793
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,109
so and i was like co-signing the
transaction

2794
00:53:53,109 --> 00:53:53,119
transaction
 

2795
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,950
transaction
uh like off-chain completely uh even

2796
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:56,960
uh like off-chain completely uh even
 

2797
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,710
uh like off-chain completely uh even
without the internet since for instance

2798
00:53:58,710 --> 00:53:58,720
without the internet since for instance
 

2799
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,630
without the internet since for instance
apple watch can be used without the

2800
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:00,640
apple watch can be used without the
 

2801
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,150
apple watch can be used without the
internet just with via bluetooth

2802
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:02,160
internet just with via bluetooth
 

2803
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,910
internet just with via bluetooth
connection it was like a very secure

2804
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:03,920
connection it was like a very secure
 

2805
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,109
connection it was like a very secure
option how we decided to go away from

2806
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:07,119
option how we decided to go away from
 

2807
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,430
option how we decided to go away from
this concept since it was not like um

2808
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:11,440
this concept since it was not like um
 

2809
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,910
this concept since it was not like um
very sustainable for

00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,069
very sustainable for
for from the business point of view

2812
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:16,079
for from the business point of view
 

2813
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,309
for from the business point of view
because it's hard to monetize the

2814
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:18,319
because it's hard to monetize the
 

2815
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,549
because it's hard to monetize the
completely off chain sync without like

the service part of the component and

2818
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:22,640
the service part of the component and
 

2819
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,270
the service part of the component and
it's not really the scheme that for

2820
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:25,280
it's not really the scheme that for
 

2821
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,589
it's not really the scheme that for
instance the services want to

00:54:27,589 --> 00:54:27,599
instance the services want to
 

2823
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,990
instance the services want to
so the idea that we stick to the server

2824
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:30,000
so the idea that we stick to the server
 

2825
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,589
so the idea that we stick to the server
was greatly because uh we see that there

2826
00:54:33,589 --> 00:54:33,599
was greatly because uh we see that there
 

2827
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,150
was greatly because uh we see that there
is a majority of users which is not like

2828
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:36,160
is a majority of users which is not like

and they want like um a strong security

2834
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:44,000
and they want like um a strong security
 

2835
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,309
and they want like um a strong security
party that will that will assist them in

2836
00:54:46,309 --> 00:54:46,319
party that will that will assist them in
 

2837
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,390
party that will that will assist them in
terms of like managing the crypto scene

2838
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:48,400
terms of like managing the crypto scene
 

2839
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,510
terms of like managing the crypto scene
which is

2840
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:49,520
which is
 

2841
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,230
which is
quite hard for them and that's why this

2842
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:52,240
quite hard for them and that's why this
 

2843
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,589
quite hard for them and that's why this
ability from one side to be independent

band cannot do a thing with my crypto
 

2851
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:03,990
band cannot do a thing with my crypto
and that's important

2852
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:04,000
and that's important
 

2853
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,829
and that's important
uh and from the other side we have a

2854
00:55:05,829 --> 00:55:05,839
uh and from the other side we have a
 

2855
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,750
uh and from the other side we have a
bank who co-signs the transactions who

2856
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:07,760
bank who co-signs the transactions who
 

2857
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,470
bank who co-signs the transactions who
can perform emails for instance as well

2858
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:10,480
can perform emails for instance as well
 

2859
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,430
can perform emails for instance as well
as all other things and that's that's

2860
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:13,440
as all other things and that's that's
 

2861
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,470
as all other things and that's that's
what we think important here uh we as

2862
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:16,480
what we think important here uh we as
 

2863
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,950
what we think important here uh we as
i've told you yes we do had an option to

2864
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960
i've told you yes we do had an option to
 

2865
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,309
i've told you yes we do had an option to
create a fully uh client-side snpc with

2866
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:22,319
create a fully uh client-side snpc with

that's

2870
00:55:25,109 --> 00:55:25,119
that's
 

2871
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,670
that's
that's what we decided not to do

2872
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:27,680
that's what we decided not to do

expected this to be a lot simpler but it

2888
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:42,000
expected this to be a lot simpler but it
 

2889
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,430
expected this to be a lot simpler but it
turned out like i said we have the gold

2890
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:43,440
turned out like i said we have the gold
 

2891
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,950
turned out like i said we have the gold
standard of presentations today i think

2892
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:44,960
standard of presentations today i think
 

2893
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,950
standard of presentations today i think
we just moved up to platinum that was

2894
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:46,960
we just moved up to platinum that was
 

2895
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,470
we just moved up to platinum that was
wonderful thank you very interesting

2896
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:48,480
wonderful thank you very interesting
 

2897
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,589
wonderful thank you very interesting
very interesting i think you're going to

2898
00:55:49,589 --> 00:55:49,599
very interesting i think you're going to
 

2899
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,150
very interesting i think you're going to
have a lot of questions

2900
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,160
have a lot of questions
 

2901
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,910
have a lot of questions
sorry sorry raise your hand but okay

2902
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:55,920

 

2903
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,710

uh

2904
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:56,720
uh
 

2905
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,390
uh
raising your hand just for the protocol

2906
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:58,400
raising your hand just for the protocol
 

2907
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,470
raising your hand just for the protocol
and um the question from community is

2908
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:00,480
and um the question from community is
 

2909
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,390
and um the question from community is
you just dropped out

2910
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:02,400
you just dropped out
 

2911
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,870
you just dropped out
just just happened in my private

2912
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:04,880
just just happened in my private
 

2913
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,870
just just happened in my private
messages so the question is

2914
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:06,880
messages so the question is
 

2915
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,670
messages so the question is
uh what is the difference between

2916
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:09,680
uh what is the difference between
 

2917
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:15,270
uh what is the difference between
two of two multisig and your solution

2918
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:15,280

 

2919
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,390

if you speak about multi-signature uh as

2920
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:18,400
if you speak about multi-signature uh as
 

2921
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,990
if you speak about multi-signature uh as
classic one and the scheme we use so if

2922
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:22,000
classic one and the scheme we use so if
 

2923
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,750
classic one and the scheme we use so if
you speak about multisig all the

2924
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:23,760
you speak about multisig all the
 

2925
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,030
you speak about multisig all the
calculations are performed on chain

2926
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:27,040
calculations are performed on chain
 

2927
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,309
calculations are performed on chain
so it's a matter of additional costs in

2928
00:56:30,309 --> 00:56:30,319
so it's a matter of additional costs in
 

2929
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,309
so it's a matter of additional costs in
terms of fees and etc

2930
00:56:32,309 --> 00:56:32,319
terms of fees and etc
 

2931
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:34,309
terms of fees and etc
if we speak about the

2932
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:34,319
if we speak about the
 

2933
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:35,589
if we speak about the
uh

2934
00:56:35,589 --> 00:56:35,599
uh
 

2935
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,150
uh
our scheme of uh

2936
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:38,160
our scheme of uh
 

2937
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,470
our scheme of uh
using the smtc scene

2938
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:40,480
using the smtc scene
 

2939
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,109
using the smtc scene
so the calculations are performed

2940
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:43,119
so the calculations are performed
 

2941
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,390
so the calculations are performed
off-chain

2942
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:44,400
off-chain
 

2943
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,789
off-chain
so there is no need so it's like a

2944
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:46,799
so there is no need so it's like a
 

2945
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,670
so there is no need so it's like a
cryptography based one so we don't no

2946
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:49,680
cryptography based one so we don't no
 

2947
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,870
cryptography based one so we don't no
need to perform any any

2948
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:52,880
need to perform any any
 

2949
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,069
need to perform any any
any transactions on chain in order to

2950
00:56:56,069 --> 00:56:56,079
any transactions on chain in order to
 

2951
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,270
any transactions on chain in order to
sign a transaction from our product

2952
00:56:59,270 --> 00:56:59,280
sign a transaction from our product
 

2953
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,190
sign a transaction from our product
so the server and mobile device are

2954
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:01,200
so the server and mobile device are
 

2955
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,710
so the server and mobile device are
exchanged like via internet with via all

2956
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:04,720
exchanged like via internet with via all
 

2957
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,270
exchanged like via internet with via all
the data in group by to make a signature

2958
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:07,280
the data in group by to make a signature
 

2959
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,150
the data in group by to make a signature
for the transaction and that's it so so

2960
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:10,160
for the transaction and that's it so so
 

2961
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,150
for the transaction and that's it so so
from from the side of blockchain our

2962
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:12,160
from from the side of blockchain our
 

2963
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,829
from from the side of blockchain our
transactions

2964
00:57:13,829 --> 00:57:13,839
transactions
 

2965
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,950
transactions
is seen as an regular one signed by the

2966
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:16,960
is seen as an regular one signed by the
 

2967
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,309
is seen as an regular one signed by the
private key by a single private key

3589
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,910
i'm just showing like uh how easy it
will be for the people to go and create

3590

so eventually um for the game
perspective it is um

3594

01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,910
breeding and you will be able to
generate a new enft that's how the whole

3602
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:33,920
generate a new enft that's how the whole
 

3603

generate a new enft that's how the whole
thing will be coming and

3604
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:36,400
thing will be coming and
 

3605
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,309
thing will be coming and
uh if you see the filters all these are

specifically so
we have you know um classes uh like

3612
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:46,880
we have you know um classes uh like
 

3613
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,189
we have you know um classes uh like
uh and it is evolving so we have

3614
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:49,199
uh and it is evolving so we have
 

3615
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:51,829
uh and it is evolving so we have
currently nine classes and um we are we

3616
01:09:51,829 --> 01:09:51,839
currently nine classes and um we are we
 

3617
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:53,669
currently nine classes and um we are we
are actually evolving our game play to

are actually evolving our game play to
support 15 classes so that the nfps can

3620
01:09:56,709 --> 01:09:56,719
support 15 classes so that the nfps can
 

3621
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,870
support 15 classes so that the nfps can
be you know minted more and there will

3622

so those will have

3680
01:10:59,270 --> 01:10:59,280
so those will have
 

3681
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,430
so those will have
a body part which will be

3682
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:01,440
a body part which will be
 

3683
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,669
a body part which will be
you know replaceable and then according

3684
01:11:03,669 --> 01:11:03,679
you know replaceable and then according
 

3685
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,470
you know replaceable and then according
to the gaming uh you know stages or

3686
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:06,480
to the gaming uh you know stages or
 

3687
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,310
to the gaming uh you know stages or
gameplay it can be

01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:13,120
tackle the villains so that's how these
 

3693
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,790
tackle the villains so that's how these
body parts will be attaching to the

character so if you have uh those kind
 

3739
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,470
character so if you have uh those kind
of uh nfps in your wallet then you will

3740
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:06,480
of uh nfps in your wallet then you will
 

3741
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,630

game play will be tuned accordingly so

3756
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:22,560
game play will be tuned accordingly so
 

3757
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,510

uh so the whole game dynamics the game

3758
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:25,520
uh so the whole game dynamics the game
 

3759
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,390
uh so the whole game dynamics the game
uh background things are all you know uh

uh background things are all you know uh
 

3761
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,870
uh background things are all you know uh
dynamic made dynamic with the nfps that

3762
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:30,880
dynamic made dynamic with the nfps that
 

3763
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,950
dynamic made dynamic with the nfps that
you are going to hold in your wallet so

3764
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:32,960
you are going to hold in your wallet so
 

3765
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,950
you are going to hold in your wallet so
that's how we have designed and this is

3766
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:34,960
that's how we have designed and this is
 

3767
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:35,910
that's how we have designed and this is
just

3768
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:35,920
just
 

3769
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,709
just
a very uh you know preliminary

3770
01:12:38,709 --> 01:12:38,719
a very uh you know preliminary
 

3771
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:40,870
a very uh you know preliminary
software which we have we are releasing

3772
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:40,880
software which we have we are releasing
 

3773
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,430
software which we have we are releasing
it opening it up so uh it is it will be

3774
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:43,440
it opening it up so uh it is it will be
 

3775
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,310
it opening it up so uh it is it will be
more interesting to see you know how

3776
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:46,320
more interesting to see you know how
 

3777
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,750
more interesting to see you know how
this whole thing is

3778
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:47,760
this whole thing is

developed this whole thing is developed
 

3781
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,750
developed this whole thing is developed
as a library so

3782
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:51,760
as a library so
 

3783
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,870
as a library so
uh in the future so marketplace backs

3784
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:54,880
uh in the future so marketplace backs
 

3785
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,030
uh in the future so marketplace backs
and uh the defi elements they are all

3786
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:57,040
and uh the defi elements they are all
 

3787
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,950
and uh the defi elements they are all
getting built in in the library so

3788
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:00,960
getting built in in the library so
 

3789
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,030
getting built in in the library so
if any other new game they wants to

3790
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:03,040
if any other new game they wants to
 

3791
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,510
if any other new game they wants to
board with us they can just you know use

3792
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:05,520
board with us they can just you know use
 

3793
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,350
board with us they can just you know use
that with few configurations and they

3794
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:07,360
that with few configurations and they
 

3795
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:10,149
that with few configurations and they
will have the whole uh you know software

3796
01:13:10,149 --> 01:13:10,159
will have the whole uh you know software
 

3797
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:12,790
will have the whole uh you know software
available so it will be purely like an

these things set up for you neatly and
 

3813
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,510
these things set up for you neatly and
you focus on only the game story

3814
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:33,520
you focus on only the game story
 

3815
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,990

gaming you know

3818
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:37,920
gaming you know
 

3819
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,910
gaming you know
framework you're going to use so even on

3820
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:39,920
framework you're going to use so even on
 

3821
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,229
framework you're going to use so even on
the on the gaming side we are making

3822
01:13:42,229 --> 01:13:42,239
the on the gaming side we are making
 

3823
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:44,470
the on the gaming side we are making
certain libraries that will be

3824
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:44,480
certain libraries that will be
 

3825
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,630
certain libraries that will be
useful for interfacing with the

3826
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:46,640
useful for interfacing with the
 

3827
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,030
useful for interfacing with the
blockchain area uh our blockchain

3828
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:49,040
blockchain area uh our blockchain
 

3829
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,870
blockchain area uh our blockchain
library so

3830
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:50,880
library so
 

3831
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,709
library so
it will be totally agnostic to the game

3832
01:13:52,709 --> 01:13:52,719
it will be totally agnostic to the game
 

3833
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:54,070
it will be totally agnostic to the game
developers

3834
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:54,080
developers
 

3835
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,590
developers
and then you know they can easily

3836
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:55,600
and then you know they can easily
 

3837
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,070
and then you know they can easily
onboard as many games as possible

3838
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:58,080
onboard as many games as possible
 

3839
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:58,950
onboard as many games as possible
so

3840
01:13:58,950 --> 01:13:58,960
so
 

3841
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,750
so
actually i yeah we are still uh maybe

3842
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:01,760
actually i yeah we are still uh maybe
 

3843
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,390
actually i yeah we are still uh maybe
maybe i i actually i was like not quite

3844
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:04,400
maybe i i actually i was like not quite
 

3845
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,070
maybe i i actually i was like not quite
organized for this call because i was

3846
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:06,080
organized for this call because i was
 

3847
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,550
organized for this call because i was
pulled in last minute i had

3848
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:08,560
pulled in last minute i had
 

3849
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,310
pulled in last minute i had
uh you know different calls and i still

3850
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:10,320
uh you know different calls and i still
 

3851
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,830
uh you know different calls and i still
have to go for another architecture

3852
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:11,840
have to go for another architecture
 

3853
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,310
have to go for another architecture
review session so maybe um in the

3854
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:14,320
review session so maybe um in the
 

3855
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,790
review session so maybe um in the
upcoming sessions i can go a little deep

3856
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:16,800
upcoming sessions i can go a little deep
 

3857
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,750
upcoming sessions i can go a little deep
into the um you know the architecture

3858
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:19,760
into the um you know the architecture
 

3859
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,590
into the um you know the architecture
part how the

3860
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:21,600
part how the
 

3861
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,310
part how the
the library is differentiated uh in a

3862
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:24,320
the library is differentiated uh in a
 

3863
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,950
the library is differentiated uh in a
modular way so that uh those solidity

3864
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:26,960
modular way so that uh those solidity
 

3865
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,470
modular way so that uh those solidity
which we wrote for

3866
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:28,480
which we wrote for
 

3867
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,790
which we wrote for
uh binance chain um

3868
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:30,800
uh binance chain um
 

3869
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,790
uh binance chain um
you know ethereum all those things can

3870
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:32,800
you know ethereum all those things can
 

3871
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,110
you know ethereum all those things can
be reused for evm based chain and then

3872
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:35,120
be reused for evm based chain and then
 

3873
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,189
be reused for evm based chain and then
how we are you know

3874
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:37,199
how we are you know
 

3875
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:38,630
how we are you know
differentiating

3876
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:38,640
differentiating
 

3877
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,110
differentiating
or making it uh more modular for ever

3878
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:41,120
or making it uh more modular for ever
 

3879
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,229
or making it uh more modular for ever
skill so that it is all interoperable uh

3880
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:44,239
skill so that it is all interoperable uh
 

3881
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:45,910
skill so that it is all interoperable uh
only areas which is specific to the

3882
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:45,920
only areas which is specific to the
 

3883
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,030
only areas which is specific to the
underlying chain will be uh you know um

3884
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:49,040
underlying chain will be uh you know um
 

3885
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,189
underlying chain will be uh you know um
called by those specific apis and the

3886
01:14:51,189 --> 01:14:51,199
called by those specific apis and the
 

3887
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:53,430
called by those specific apis and the
whole game will function without uh you

3888
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:53,440
whole game will function without uh you
 

3889
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,110
whole game will function without uh you
know having any knowledge about the

3890
01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:55,120
know having any knowledge about the
 

3891
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,430
know having any knowledge about the
underlying chain it is in so that's the

3892
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:57,440
underlying chain it is in so that's the
 

3893
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,149
underlying chain it is in so that's the
whole uh idea that's the crux of uh you

3894
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:00,159
whole uh idea that's the crux of uh you
 

3895
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:02,070
whole uh idea that's the crux of uh you
know where we are uh still a lot of

3896
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:02,080
know where we are uh still a lot of
 

3897
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,270
know where we are uh still a lot of
things are

3898
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:03,280
things are
 

3899
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,910
things are
in pipeline for this month so we work in

3900
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:05,920
in pipeline for this month so we work in
 

3901
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,070
in pipeline for this month so we work in
a completely agile

3902
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:08,080
a completely agile
 

3903
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,750
a completely agile
environment so there is a two-week

3904
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:09,760
environment so there is a two-week
 

3905
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,390
environment so there is a two-week
sprint and every two weeks we have

3906
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:12,400
sprint and every two weeks we have
 

3907
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,390
sprint and every two weeks we have
something getting added so in the next

3908
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:14,400
something getting added so in the next
 

3909
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,910
something getting added so in the next
two weeks you will see

3910
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:15,920
two weeks you will see
 

3911
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,830
two weeks you will see
uh our whole marketplace will be

3912
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:17,840
uh our whole marketplace will be
 

3913
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,430
uh our whole marketplace will be
upgraded to the new

3914
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:19,440
upgraded to the new
 

3915
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,590
upgraded to the new
newer version that's happening now and

3916
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:21,600
newer version that's happening now and
 

3917
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,870
newer version that's happening now and
then on the gaming side we are um you

3918
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:24,880
then on the gaming side we are um you
 

3919
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,870
then on the gaming side we are um you
know we are releasing uh the first four

3920
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:26,880
know we are releasing uh the first four
 

3921
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,350
know we are releasing uh the first four
characters those special you know ultra

3922
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:29,360
characters those special you know ultra
 

3923
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,830
characters those special you know ultra
rare uh characters will be launched by

3924
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:31,840
rare uh characters will be launched by
 

3925
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,630
rare uh characters will be launched by
end of this month and then uh as dan

3926
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:34,640
end of this month and then uh as dan
 

3927
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,669
end of this month and then uh as dan
mentioned uh our um you know ukrainian

3928
01:15:37,669 --> 01:15:37,679
mentioned uh our um you know ukrainian
 

3929
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:38,709
mentioned uh our um you know ukrainian
colleagues

3930
01:15:38,709 --> 01:15:38,719
colleagues
 

3931
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:40,950
colleagues
will be working on getting the the first

3932
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:40,960
will be working on getting the the first
 

3933
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,790
will be working on getting the the first
version of the game uh you know in a

3934
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:42,800
version of the game uh you know in a
 

3935
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,189
version of the game uh you know in a
sprint sprint cycle once they're ready

3936
01:15:45,189 --> 01:15:45,199
sprint sprint cycle once they're ready
 

3937
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:47,350
sprint sprint cycle once they're ready
so that's our overall plan and that's

3938
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:47,360
so that's our overall plan and that's
 

3939
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,430
so that's our overall plan and that's
how we are progressing in achieving our

3940
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:49,440
how we are progressing in achieving our
 

3941
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,910
how we are progressing in achieving our
goal so within the uh four to five

3942
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:51,920
goal so within the uh four to five
 

3943
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,270
goal so within the uh four to five
sprints we will be in a very good

3944
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:53,280
sprints we will be in a very good
 

3945
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,470
sprints we will be in a very good
position to

3946
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:54,480
position to
 

3947
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,790
position to
uh launch it to public so pre-sale will

3948
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:56,800
uh launch it to public so pre-sale will
 

3949
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,950
uh launch it to public so pre-sale will
be launching much much earlier probably

3950
01:15:58,950 --> 01:15:58,960
be launching much much earlier probably
 

3951
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,669
be launching much much earlier probably
in next two to three sprints and then uh

3952
01:16:01,669 --> 01:16:01,679
in next two to three sprints and then uh
 

3953
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:03,910
in next two to three sprints and then uh
you know something for people to go and

3954
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:03,920
you know something for people to go and
 

3955
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,390
you know something for people to go and
play around in in five sprints that's

3956
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:06,400
play around in in five sprints that's
 

3957
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,990
play around in in five sprints that's
our overall plan

3958
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:10,000

 

3959
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,310

and just to add to that so in terms of

3960
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:12,320
and just to add to that so in terms of
 

3961
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:15,110
and just to add to that so in terms of
ip in our first game so we are

3962
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:15,120
ip in our first game so we are
 

3963
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,189
ip in our first game so we are
developing we developed our own uh

3964
01:16:17,189 --> 01:16:17,199
developing we developed our own uh
 

3965
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:20,550
developing we developed our own uh
gameplay so that's first part of the ip

3966
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:20,560
gameplay so that's first part of the ip
 

3967
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,950
gameplay so that's first part of the ip
and then secondly we have a team of

3968
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:22,960
and then secondly we have a team of
 

3969
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,669
and then secondly we have a team of
artists uh in-house that we developed uh

3970
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:25,679
artists uh in-house that we developed uh
 

3971
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:27,750
artists uh in-house that we developed uh
stories for and characters that were

3972
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:27,760
stories for and characters that were
 

3973
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,550
stories for and characters that were
turned into nfcs and they may actually

3974
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:30,560
turned into nfcs and they may actually
 

3975
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,669
turned into nfcs and they may actually
become you know movie movie uh series uh

3976
01:16:33,669 --> 01:16:33,679
become you know movie movie uh series uh
 

3977
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:34,790
become you know movie movie uh series uh
later on

3978
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:34,800
later on
 

3979
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,310
later on
uh so that's the ap on our first game

3980
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:38,320
uh so that's the ap on our first game
 

3981
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,830
uh so that's the ap on our first game
but essentially we are open platform uh

3982
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:41,840
but essentially we are open platform uh
 

3983
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,830
but essentially we are open platform uh
to allow game developers to launch in

3984
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:43,840
to allow game developers to launch in
 

3985
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,030
to allow game developers to launch in
our platform

3986
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:45,040
our platform
 

3987
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,870
our platform
uh so that's basically the overview and

3988
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:46,880
uh so that's basically the overview and
 

3989
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,470
uh so that's basically the overview and
then you know we want to make it

3990
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:48,480
then you know we want to make it
 

3991
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,870
then you know we want to make it
accessible so we don't want to provide

3992
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:50,880
accessible so we don't want to provide
 

3993
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,390
accessible so we don't want to provide
entry-level prices for guys and girls in

3994
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:54,400

01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:13,760
had a clear roadmap uh you know given
 

4161
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,229
had a clear roadmap uh you know given
that we will be able to start only after

4162
01:20:16,229 --> 01:20:16,239
that we will be able to start only after
 

4163
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:18,550
that we will be able to start only after
the first uh you know the game is

4164
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:18,560
the first uh you know the game is
 

4165
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,709
the first uh you know the game is
launched which is like maybe you know

4166
01:20:20,709 --> 01:20:20,719
launched which is like maybe you know
 

4167
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:22,790
launched which is like maybe you know
two to three sprints away

4168
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:22,800
two to three sprints away
 

4169
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,390
two to three sprints away
so the current uh team is focusing on um

4170
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:26,400
so the current uh team is focusing on um
 

4171
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,229
so the current uh team is focusing on um
getting the current uh you know pipeline

4172
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:28,239
getting the current uh you know pipeline
 

4173
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:32,229
getting the current uh you know pipeline
out we are also um expanding our team um

4174
01:20:32,229 --> 01:20:32,239
out we are also um expanding our team um
 

4175
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:34,149
out we are also um expanding our team um
so once the current uh you know sprints

4176
01:20:34,149 --> 01:20:34,159
so once the current uh you know sprints
 

4177
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:35,910
so once the current uh you know sprints
are done then we will start uh

4178
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:35,920
are done then we will start uh
 

4179
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:38,229
are done then we will start uh
full-blown with our skill so

4180
01:20:38,229 --> 01:20:38,239
full-blown with our skill so
 

4181
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:40,390
full-blown with our skill so
yeah

4182
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:40,400
yeah
 

4183
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,149
yeah
that's a time period we already

4184
01:20:42,149 --> 01:20:42,159
that's a time period we already
 

4185
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:43,590
that's a time period we already
communicated clearly yeah yeah i

4186
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:43,600
communicated clearly yeah yeah i
 

4187
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,510
communicated clearly yeah yeah i
understand that i think um i'm reading

4188
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:45,520
understand that i think um i'm reading
 

4189
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,790
understand that i think um i'm reading
some of the questions that are out there

4190
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:46,800
some of the questions that are out there
 

4191
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,310
some of the questions that are out there
so um

4192
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:48,320
so um
 

4193
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,189
so um
you know uh don't mind me uh but uh

4194
01:20:51,189 --> 01:20:51,199
you know uh don't mind me uh but uh
 

4195
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:53,430
you know uh don't mind me uh but uh
everscale you know it's not a

4196
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:53,440
everscale you know it's not a
 

4197
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,350
everscale you know it's not a
i mean the grand program is for the

4198
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:55,360
i mean the grand program is for the
 

4199
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,750
i mean the grand program is for the
benefit of everscale

4200
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:57,760
benefit of everscale
 

4201
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,870
benefit of everscale
you know so

4202
01:20:58,870 --> 01:20:58,880
you know so
 

4203
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,950
you know so
i'll read some of the questions yeah so

4204
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:00,960
i'll read some of the questions yeah so
 

4205
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,229
i'll read some of the questions yeah so
so i mean uh i'm sure every scale knows

4206
01:21:04,229 --> 01:21:04,239
so i mean uh i'm sure every scale knows
 

4207
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,350
so i mean uh i'm sure every scale knows
why

4208
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:05,360
why
 

4209
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:08,950
why
he gave her he gave us a grant and uh

4210
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:08,960
he gave her he gave us a grant and uh
 

4211
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,950
he gave her he gave us a grant and uh
you know we know why it's basically to

4212
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:10,960
you know we know why it's basically to
 

4213
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,590
you know we know why it's basically to
develop games together using everscale

4214
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:13,600
develop games together using everscale
 

4215
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:18,470
develop games together using everscale
infrastructure for scalability

4216
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:18,480

 

4217
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,430

okay

4218
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:19,440
okay
 

4219
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,350
okay
so we don't have anything built on

4220
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:21,360
so we don't have anything built on
 

4221
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,030
so we don't have anything built on
everscale yet because we're very new

4222
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:23,040
everscale yet because we're very new
 

4223
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,189
everscale yet because we're very new
we're only four months old i understand

4224
01:21:25,189 --> 01:21:25,199
we're only four months old i understand

question is in five parts i'm going to
skip over uh the repetitive parts but

4250
01:21:52,149 --> 01:21:52,159
skip over uh the repetitive parts but
 

4251
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:55,430
skip over uh the repetitive parts but
there's uh why was gam gamepay allocated

4252
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:55,440
there's uh why was gam gamepay allocated
 

4253
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:58,310
there's uh why was gam gamepay allocated
250 000 dollars worth um they have

4254
01:21:58,310 --> 01:21:58,320
250 000 dollars worth um they have
 

4255
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,550
250 000 dollars worth um they have
social networks that have many bots and

4256
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:00,560
social networks that have many bots and
 

4257
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,270
social networks that have many bots and
fake users i'm just reading what's

4258
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:03,280
fake users i'm just reading what's
 

4259
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,550
fake users i'm just reading what's
what's being

4260
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:04,560

uh where did those
 

4267
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,430
uh where did those
who allocated token okay that that's

4268
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:15,440
who allocated token okay that that's
 

4269
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,430
who allocated token okay that that's
i'm not gonna i'll skip that

4270
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:17,440
i'm not gonna i'll skip that
 

4271
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,709
i'm not gonna i'll skip that
um

4272
01:22:18,709 --> 01:22:18,719
um
 

4273
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:20,229
um
is there

4274
01:22:20,229 --> 01:22:20,239
is there
 

4275
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:22,149
is there
uh

4276
01:22:22,149 --> 01:22:22,159
uh
 

4277
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:26,310
uh
it looks like uh someone basically

4278
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:26,320
it looks like uh someone basically
 

4279
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,510
it looks like uh someone basically
uh

4280
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:27,520
uh
 

4281
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,790
uh
it looks as if someone of their own i

4282
01:22:30,790 --> 01:22:30,800
it looks as if someone of their own i
 

4283
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:35,110
it looks as if someone of their own i
think this gentleman or lady is uh

4284
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:35,120
think this gentleman or lady is uh
 

4285
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,709
think this gentleman or lady is uh
has poor english but i think what

4286
01:22:36,709 --> 01:22:36,719
has poor english but i think what
 

4287
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:38,470
has poor english but i think what
they're trying to convey is that it

4288
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:38,480
they're trying to convey is that it
 

4289
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,910
they're trying to convey is that it
looks like

4290
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:39,920
looks like
 

4291
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,350
looks like
someone

4292
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:41,360
someone
 

4293
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:45,750
someone
provided tokens inside a closed group uh

4294
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:45,760
provided tokens inside a closed group uh
 

4295
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,669
provided tokens inside a closed group uh
how is that different from any previous

4296
01:22:47,669 --> 01:22:47,679
how is that different from any previous
 

4297
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:51,510
how is that different from any previous
partnerships with overscale

4298
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:51,520

 

4299
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,709

why do we allocate 250 000 for a grant

4300
01:22:54,709 --> 01:22:54,719
why do we allocate 250 000 for a grant
 

4301
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:57,189
why do we allocate 250 000 for a grant
but cannot allocate the same amount for

4302
01:22:57,189 --> 01:22:57,199
but cannot allocate the same amount for
 

4303
01:22:57,199 --> 01:22:59,430
but cannot allocate the same amount for
listing on an exchange for instance

4304
01:22:59,430 --> 01:22:59,440
listing on an exchange for instance
 

4305
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,270
listing on an exchange for instance
traders will come from the exchange and

4306
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:01,280
traders will come from the exchange and
 

4307
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:02,629
traders will come from the exchange and
there will be more liquidity in the

4308
01:23:02,629 --> 01:23:02,639
there will be more liquidity in the
 

4309
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:03,830
there will be more liquidity in the
network

4310
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:03,840
network
 

4311
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,590
network
um

4312
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:05,600
um
 

4313
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,830
um
so that's like three parts of one

4314
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:07,840
so that's like three parts of one
 

4315
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,110
so that's like three parts of one
question i guess essentially they're

4316
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:09,120
question i guess essentially they're
 

4317
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,709
question i guess essentially they're
asking

4318
01:23:10,709 --> 01:23:10,719
asking
 

4319
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:11,910
asking
the people are asking they don't

4320
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:11,920
the people are asking they don't
 

4321
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,669
the people are asking they don't
understand what the benefits to the

4322
01:23:13,669 --> 01:23:13,679
understand what the benefits to the
 

4323
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:15,430
understand what the benefits to the

um
if not that's it for written questions

4664
01:29:58,950 --> 01:29:58,960
if not that's it for written questions
 

4665
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,350
if not that's it for written questions
let's go to youtube

4666
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:01,360
let's go to youtube
 

4667
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,950
let's go to youtube
um

4668
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:02,960
um
 

4669
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:03,830
um
right

4670
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:03,840
right
 

4671
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,510
right
so

4672
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:05,520
so
 

4673
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,390
so
uh

4674
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:06,400

4675
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,229
uh
there was a question asked and the

4676
01:30:08,229 --> 01:30:08,239
there was a question asked and the
 

4677
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:10,470
there was a question asked and the
question was answered um it wasn't

question was answered um it wasn't
retracted so let me read uh somebody

4680
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:13,280
retracted so let me read uh somebody
 

4681
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,070
retracted so let me read uh somebody
says i'm concerned about the facial

4682
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:16,080
says i'm concerned about the facial
 

4683
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,910
says i'm concerned about the facial
features in terms of

4684
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:17,920
features in terms of
 

4685
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,790
features in terms of
collisions i think collusions maybe he

4686
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:20,800
collisions i think collusions maybe he
 

4687
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,669
collisions i think collusions maybe he
meant any data regarding say twins or so

4688
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:23,679
meant any data regarding say twins or so
 

4689
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:25,830
meant any data regarding say twins or so
so this is a facial recognition question

4690
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:25,840
so this is a facial recognition question
 

4691
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:29,350
so this is a facial recognition question
question this is for spacium

4692
01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:29,360
question this is for spacium
 

4693
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:32,149
question this is for spacium
so if you try to get too much too many

4694
01:30:32,149 --> 01:30:32,159
so if you try to get too much too many
 

4695
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:34,070
so if you try to get too much too many
bits from the facial features it could

4696
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:34,080
bits from the facial features it could
 

4697
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:34,870
bits from the facial features it could
be

4698
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:34,880
be
 

4699
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,270
be
not that constant

4700
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:37,280
not that constant
 

4701
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:42,629
not that constant
along some person's life and if you take

4702
01:30:42,629 --> 01:30:42,639
along some person's life and if you take
 

4703
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:44,310
along some person's life and if you take
take too little

4704
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:44,320
take too little
 

4705
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,470
take too little
about a bits

4706
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:46,480
about a bits
 

4707
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,550
about a bits
from face

4708
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:48,560
from face
 

4709
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,189
from face
can be not secure

4710
01:30:51,189 --> 01:30:51,199
can be not secure
 

4711
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:52,790
can be not secure
okay um

4712
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:52,800
okay um
 

4713
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,390
okay um
and then it was answered so we're not

4714
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:54,400
and then it was answered so we're not
 

4715
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,470
and then it was answered so we're not
really extracting the secret from the

4716
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:56,480
really extracting the secret from the
 

4717
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:59,910
really extracting the secret from the
user's biometrics we instead teach nnn

4718
01:30:59,910 --> 01:30:59,920
user's biometrics we instead teach nnn
 

4719
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,750
user's biometrics we instead teach nnn
to provide the previously generated

4720
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:01,760
to provide the previously generated
 

4721
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,310
to provide the previously generated
secret each time certain uh face

4722
01:31:04,310 --> 01:31:04,320
secret each time certain uh face
 

4723
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,510
secret each time certain uh face
features are submitted to it but um

4724
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:07,520
features are submitted to it but um
 

4725
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,229
features are submitted to it but um
i i think the question and the answer

4726
01:31:10,229 --> 01:31:10,239
i i think the question and the answer
 

4727
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:12,229
i i think the question and the answer
they sort of canceled each other out i

4728
01:31:12,229 --> 01:31:12,239
they sort of canceled each other out i
 

4729
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:13,750
they sort of canceled each other out i
could say that i actually worked in a

4730
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:13,760
could say that i actually worked in a
 

4731
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,910
could say that i actually worked in a
facial recognition company uh there's

4732
01:31:15,910 --> 01:31:15,920
facial recognition company uh there's
 

4733
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,870
facial recognition company uh there's
another gentleman who's part of the

4734
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:18,880
another gentleman who's part of the
 

4735
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:21,030
another gentleman who's part of the
everex team who has as well and we're
