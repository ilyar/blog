itself has has been transformed like for
 

245
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,230
itself has has been transformed like for
like for the last year uh a couple of

246
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
like for the last year uh a couple of
 

247
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,110
like for the last year uh a couple of
times

248
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
times
 

249
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,230
times
uh firstly we started on working on a

250
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
uh firstly we started on working on a
 

251
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,390
uh firstly we started on working on a
south sudan identity system but very

252
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
south sudan identity system but very
 

253
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,150
south sudan identity system but very
soon we found out that

254
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
soon we found out that
 

255
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,550
soon we found out that
self-serving identity itself uh is not

256
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
self-serving identity itself uh is not
 

257
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,870
self-serving identity itself uh is not
necessary unfortunately because people

258
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
necessary unfortunately because people
 

259
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,950
necessary unfortunately because people
don't understand like what's uh the

260
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
don't understand like what's uh the
 

261
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,270
don't understand like what's uh the
meaning of uh owning their own

262
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
meaning of uh owning their own
 

263
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,430
meaning of uh owning their own
credentials and owning the

264
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
credentials and owning the
 

265
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,390
credentials and owning the
uh like access to any uh other

266
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
uh like access to any uh other
 

267
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,390
uh like access to any uh other
informational system and they didn't

268
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
informational system and they didn't
 

269
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,110
informational system and they didn't
people basically do not see a very a

270
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,120
people basically do not see a very a
 

271
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,550
people basically do not see a very a
very specific value of uh this

272
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
very specific value of uh this
 

273
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,469
very specific value of uh this
functionality uh therefore we decided uh

274
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
functionality uh therefore we decided uh
 

275
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,550
functionality uh therefore we decided uh
to just to develop

276
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
to just to develop
 

277
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,830
to just to develop
this idea

278
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
this idea
 

279
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,670
this idea
and to grow uh in the creation of

280
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
and to grow uh in the creation of
 

281
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,390
and to grow uh in the creation of
request platform so basically

282
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
request platform so basically
 

283
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,110
request platform so basically
uh we decided uh that

284
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
uh we decided uh that
 

285
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,350
uh we decided uh that
the best way to learn people how to use

286
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
the best way to learn people how to use
 

287
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,029
the best way to learn people how to use
self-certain identity instruments and

288
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
self-certain identity instruments and
 

289
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,950
self-certain identity instruments and
self-sovereign identity tools

290
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
self-sovereign identity tools
 

291
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,070
self-sovereign identity tools
is to

292
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
is to
 

293
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,870
is to
give them some incentives of using this

294
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
give them some incentives of using this
 

295
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,350
give them some incentives of using this
tool and we decided that the web3 on

296
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
tool and we decided that the web3 on
 

297
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,350
tool and we decided that the web3 on
board and quest platform is the best

298
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360
board and quest platform is the best
 

299
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,510
board and quest platform is the best
incentive for them because uh firstly

300
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
incentive for them because uh firstly
 

301
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,189
incentive for them because uh firstly
they create a wallet that's of huge

302
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
they create a wallet that's of huge
 

303
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,950
they create a wallet that's of huge
importance then they make certain

304
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
importance then they make certain
 

305
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,029
importance then they make certain
transactions and then they receive

306
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
transactions and then they receive
 

307
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,189
transactions and then they receive
certain achievements in the form of

308
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
certain achievements in the form of
 

309
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,670
certain achievements in the form of
off-chain verifiable credentials for

310
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
off-chain verifiable credentials for
 

311
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,870
off-chain verifiable credentials for
on-chain credentials such as nfts and

312
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
on-chain credentials such as nfts and
 

313
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,270
on-chain credentials such as nfts and
all this topic uh just emerged like

314
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
all this topic uh just emerged like
 

315
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,469
all this topic uh just emerged like
since may 2022 when retaliating

basically uh this concept just it bit a

320
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
basically uh this concept just it bit a
 

321
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,309
basically uh this concept just it bit a
bit different from our uh like

322
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
bit different from our uh like
 

323
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,309
bit different from our uh like
basic idea that we started with but um

324
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
basic idea that we started with but um
 

325
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,270
basic idea that we started with but um
it's like it still supports our basic

326
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
it's like it still supports our basic
 

327
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,629
it's like it still supports our basic
principles and uh recently on uh

328
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
principles and uh recently on uh
 

329
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,189
principles and uh recently on uh
brochures elysium hackathon uh we

330
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
brochures elysium hackathon uh we
 

331
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,990
brochures elysium hackathon uh we
decided to implement all about token uh

332
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
decided to implement all about token uh
 

333
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,150
decided to implement all about token uh
but in fact uh this soul bound token

334
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
but in fact uh this soul bound token
 

335
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,830
but in fact uh this soul bound token
just is a part of uh functionality of

336
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840
just is a part of uh functionality of
 

337
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,230
just is a part of uh functionality of
identity space that we are going to

338
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
identity space that we are going to
 

339
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,189
identity space that we are going to
implement in september 2022. so

340
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
implement in september 2022. so
 

341
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,029
implement in september 2022. so
basically that's our journey from

342
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
basically that's our journey from
 

343
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,909
basically that's our journey from

especially in their scale ecosystem
 

395
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,790
especially in their scale ecosystem
uh therefore we decided to call

396
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
uh therefore we decided to call
 

397
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,189
uh therefore we decided to call
ourselves uh in the way that will

398

415
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,390
at this prefix ix
uh so uh basically and we started to

416
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
uh so uh basically and we started to
 

417
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,150
uh so uh basically and we started to
google this name and found out that

this name as soon as possible
 

431
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,630
this name as soon as possible
okay it's always interesting to kind of

432
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
okay it's always interesting to kind of
 

433
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,350
okay it's always interesting to kind of
dive behind what's behind the name and

dive behind what's behind the name and
the brand identity and how teams kind of

436
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
the brand identity and how teams kind of
 

437
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,670
the brand identity and how teams kind of
come about it

438
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
come about it
 

439
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,310
come about it
okay so next question is why did you

440
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
okay so next question is why did you
 

441
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,590
okay so next question is why did you
choose every scale blockchain

442
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
choose every scale blockchain
 

443
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,230
choose every scale blockchain
yeah uh this is pretty interesting

444
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
yeah uh this is pretty interesting
 

445
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,430
yeah uh this is pretty interesting
question because

446
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
question because
 

447
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,310
question because
uh

448
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,320
uh
 

449
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,710
uh
our team before we started to work on a

450
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
our team before we started to work on a
 

451
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,230
our team before we started to work on a
product we decided to participate uh in

452
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240
product we decided to participate uh in
 

453
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,590
product we decided to participate uh in
the first

454
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
the first
 

455
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,949
the first
stage of uh ever scale self-serving

456
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
stage of uh ever scale self-serving
 

457
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,070
stage of uh ever scale self-serving
identity framework we uh wrote a

458
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
identity framework we uh wrote a
 

459
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,670
identity framework we uh wrote a
theoretical paper that took uh the first

460
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
theoretical paper that took uh the first
 

461
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,470
theoretical paper that took uh the first
place and we got like the first award we

462
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
place and we got like the first award we
 

463
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,030
place and we got like the first award we
wrote a paper on 100 pages with the

464
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
wrote a paper on 100 pages with the
 

465
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,230
wrote a paper on 100 pages with the
theoretical

466
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240
theoretical
 

467
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,670
theoretical
uh like

468
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
uh like
 

469
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,910
uh like
background of social identity and with

470
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
background of social identity and with
 

471
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,230
background of social identity and with
some practical implementations of it and

472
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
some practical implementations of it and
 

473
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,829
some practical implementations of it and
what can be done with certain identity

474
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:34,839
what can be done with certain identity
 

475
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,190
what can be done with certain identity
instruments uh in the

476
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
instruments uh in the
 

477
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,070
instruments uh in the
ever scale ecosystem and after that we

478
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
ever scale ecosystem and after that we
 

479
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,630
ever scale ecosystem and after that we
decided okay if we are really good in

480
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
decided okay if we are really good in
 

481
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,630
decided okay if we are really good in
writing papers in every scale maybe

482
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
writing papers in every scale maybe
 

483
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,509
writing papers in every scale maybe
let's do something and another scale and

484
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
let's do something and another scale and
 

485
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,550
let's do something and another scale and
we decided to make a small team and

486
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
we decided to make a small team and
 

487
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,030
we decided to make a small team and
this like poor team that joined in

488
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
this like poor team that joined in
 

489
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,230
this like poor team that joined in
writing uh this paper like was uh

490
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
writing uh this paper like was uh
 

491
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,910
writing uh this paper like was uh
courting for uh the future uh project

492
00:09:59,910 --> 00:09:59,920
courting for uh the future uh project
 

493
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,630
courting for uh the future uh project
identities uh so

494
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
identities uh so
 

495
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,350
identities uh so
therefore like every scale ecosystem was

496
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,360
therefore like every scale ecosystem was
 

497
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,190
therefore like every scale ecosystem was
something that uh united us to work uh

498
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
something that uh united us to work uh
 

499
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,030
something that uh united us to work uh
on this project on a permanent basis

500
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
on this project on a permanent basis
 

501
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,190
on this project on a permanent basis
because all of us had like other

502
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200
because all of us had like other
 

503
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,069
because all of us had like other
activities and uh in fact we abandoned

504
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
activities and uh in fact we abandoned
 

505
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,870
activities and uh in fact we abandoned
almost all of them and focused on it

506
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
almost all of them and focused on it
 

507
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,630
almost all of them and focused on it
therefore like every scale it is

508
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
therefore like every scale it is
 

509
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,670
therefore like every scale it is
something that was uh with us from the

510
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
something that was uh with us from the
 

511
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,230
something that was uh with us from the

they go all four quests beforehand
and it doesn't help them to learn

868
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,160
and it doesn't help them to learn
 

869
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,630
and it doesn't help them to learn
difficult things and it doesn't help us

so we decided to
we call it unbound quests we will show

investors understand what will be um
 

939
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,830
investors understand what will be um
what will be developed within a certain

940
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:05,840
what will be developed within a certain
 

941
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,510
what will be developed within a certain
period of time but

942
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
period of time but
 

943
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,789
period of time but
we do not have talking yet so we have

944
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:10,799
we do not have talking yet so we have
 

945
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,870
we do not have talking yet so we have
only founders to be

946
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:12,880
only founders to be
 

947
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,190
only founders to be
responsible to

948
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
responsible to
 

949
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,909
responsible to
so

950
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:15,919
so
 

951
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,789
so
we didn't think that uh roadmap is

952
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
we didn't think that uh roadmap is
 

953
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,190
we didn't think that uh roadmap is
something very uh

954
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,200
something very uh
 

955
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,190
something very uh
desired by the by by by all end users

956
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
desired by the by by by all end users
 

957
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,470
desired by the by by by all end users
usually they desire get more quests to

958
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:28,480
usually they desire get more quests to
 

959
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,789
usually they desire get more quests to
to to go through not roadmap

960
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:32,799

 

961
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,470

oh it could be really intriguing

962
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:34,480
oh it could be really intriguing
 

963
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,909
oh it could be really intriguing
treatment though because if you have a

964
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:35,919
treatment though because if you have a
 

965
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,310
treatment though because if you have a
roadmap that you know shows that you

966
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,320
roadmap that you know shows that you
 

967
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,990
roadmap that you know shows that you
have something

968
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,000
have something
 

969
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,070
have something
exciting coming up you know they'll be

970
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,080
exciting coming up you know they'll be
 

971
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,870
exciting coming up you know they'll be
more inclined to hold tokens and

972
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:44,880
more inclined to hold tokens and
 

973
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,710
more inclined to hold tokens and
earn as much as possible

974
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:46,720
earn as much as possible
 

975
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,750
earn as much as possible
so i think

976
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
so i think
 

977
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,909
so i think
that's how yeah yeah that's sort of

978
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:49,919
that's how yeah yeah that's sort of
 

979
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,470
that's how yeah yeah that's sort of
happening just uh the only thing that we

980
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:52,480
happening just uh the only thing that we
 

981
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,190
happening just uh the only thing that we
should understand here is that roadmap

982
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,200
should understand here is that roadmap
 

983
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,110
should understand here is that roadmap

decided okay like this doesn't work and
this doesn't work let's like fix our

1012
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:26,640
this doesn't work let's like fix our

mixtapes and
 

1015
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,470
mixtapes and
we totally changed the platform and we

1016
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,480
we totally changed the platform and we
 

1017
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,630
we totally changed the platform and we
are planning to release it to release it

1018
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:32,640
are planning to release it to release it
 

1019
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,110
are planning to release it to release it
in august at the beginning of august and

1020
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,120
in august at the beginning of august and
 

1021
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,470
in august at the beginning of august and
to make it live

1022
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:36,480
to make it live
 

1023
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,470
to make it live
and then we will receive like first

1024
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480
and then we will receive like first
 

1025
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,190
and then we will receive like first
feedback from our audience uh and we

1026
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:41,200
feedback from our audience uh and we
 

1027
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,190
feedback from our audience uh and we
will understand how it works

1028
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200
will understand how it works
 

1029
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,310
will understand how it works
uh

1030
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,320
uh
 

1031
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,950
uh
so basically then obviously we will make

1032
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:46,960
so basically then obviously we will make
 

1033
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,190
so basically then obviously we will make
very like some kind of a concrete road

1034
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,200
very like some kind of a concrete road
 

1035
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,710
very like some kind of a concrete road
map to develop

1036
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:50,720
map to develop
 

1037
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,630
map to develop
but we don't do it uh like purposely

1038
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:54,640
but we don't do it uh like purposely
 

1039
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,470
but we don't do it uh like purposely
because we want to receive a like

1040
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
because we want to receive a like
 

1041
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,230
because we want to receive a like
primary feedback from

1042
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:58,240
primary feedback from
 

1043
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,950
primary feedback from
uh our audience and test certain

1044
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:00,960
uh our audience and test certain
 

1045
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,390
uh our audience and test certain
hypotheses but uh i may promise like

1046
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,400
hypotheses but uh i may promise like
 

1047
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,630
hypotheses but uh i may promise like
that uh obviously we are going to

1048
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:06,640
that uh obviously we are going to
 

1049
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,750
that uh obviously we are going to
implement

1050
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760
implement
 

1051
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,470
implement
uh

1052

00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
the functionality of uh
 

1055
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,310
the functionality of uh
like

1056
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,320
like
 

1057
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,470
like

1063
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,990
tokens we may call it in different ways
that's something that we are going to do

1064
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000
that's something that we are going to do
 

1065
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,950
that's something that we are going to do
anyway

1066
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:20,960
anyway
 

1067
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,149
anyway
and

1068
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:22,159
and
 

1069
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,710
and
obviously we will focus on the mobile

1070
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:24,720
obviously we will focus on the mobile
 

1071
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,630
obviously we will focus on the mobile
version of the platform because

1072
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:26,640
version of the platform because
 

1073
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,149
version of the platform because
currently it is

1074
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:28,159
currently it is
 

1075
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,430
currently it is
on the desktop but we understand that uh

1076
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
on the desktop but we understand that uh
 

1077
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,029
on the desktop but we understand that uh
at least half of our potential users uh

1078
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:35,039
at least half of our potential users uh
 

1079
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,630
at least half of our potential users uh
try to test our product from the mobile

1080
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:38,640
try to test our product from the mobile
 

1081
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,590
try to test our product from the mobile
devices and uh it is not something that

1082
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:41,600
devices and uh it is not something that
 

1083
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,310
devices and uh it is not something that
we are ready for now because like for in

1084
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,320
we are ready for now because like for in
 

1085
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,510
we are ready for now because like for in
in case of mobile ux and moving uh

1086
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,520
in case of mobile ux and moving uh
 

1087
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,149
in case of mobile ux and moving uh
across various applications it's a bit

1088
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:50,159
across various applications it's a bit
 

1089
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,430
across various applications it's a bit
more difficult

1090
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:51,440
more difficult
 

1091
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,149
more difficult
to create a product uh like webster

1092
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:54,159
to create a product uh like webster
 

1093
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,149
to create a product uh like webster
mobile product rather than desktop

1094
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:56,159
mobile product rather than desktop
 

1095
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,470
mobile product rather than desktop
therefore we decided to make to be

1096
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:58,480
therefore we decided to make to be
 

1097
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,549
therefore we decided to make to be
desktop first and then

1098
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:00,559
desktop first and then
 

1099
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,630
desktop first and then
mobile uh second

1100
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:02,640
mobile uh second
 

1101
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,270
mobile uh second
makes sense makes sense okay let's move

1102
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:05,280
makes sense makes sense okay let's move
 

1103
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,190
makes sense makes sense okay let's move
on to the next question someone wants to

1104
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,200
on to the next question someone wants to
 

1105
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,430
on to the next question someone wants to
know if you have an audit and if you can

1106
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:09,440
know if you have an audit and if you can
 

1107
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,110
know if you have an audit and if you can
show it

1108
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,120
show it
 

1109
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,350
show it
well basically uh

1110
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,360
well basically uh
 

1111
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,270
well basically uh
we are not like a

1112
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,280
we are not like a
 

1113
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,510
we are not like a
decentralized finance product and we

1114
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
decentralized finance product and we
 

1115
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,310
decentralized finance product and we
don't have a great set of smart

1116
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:20,320
don't have a great set of smart
 

1117
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,990
don't have a great set of smart
contracts to

1118
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,000
contracts to
 

1119
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,710
contracts to
uh to demonstrate and we don't

1120
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:24,720
uh to demonstrate and we don't
 

1121
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,470
uh to demonstrate and we don't
we don't even need to demonstrate some

1122
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,480
we don't even need to demonstrate some
 

1123
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,830
we don't even need to demonstrate some
logics because

1124
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
logics because
 

1125
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,630
logics because
uh

uh this is all that this functionality

1240
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,000
uh this is all that this functionality
 

1241
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,630
uh this is all that this functionality
is

1242
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:58,640
is
 

1243
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,390
is
uh public as well

1244
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,400
uh public as well
 

1245
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,470
uh public as well
uh but we didn't do any

1246
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:02,480
uh but we didn't do any
 

1247
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,789
uh but we didn't do any
uh audit because basically we don't need

1248
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
uh audit because basically we don't need
 

1249
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,710
uh audit because basically we don't need
it because like most of our

1250
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:06,720
it because like most of our
 

1251
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,830
it because like most of our
functionality is uh proprietary software

1252
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:09,840
functionality is uh proprietary software
 

1253
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,149
functionality is uh proprietary software
and it's closed therefore there is no

1254
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:12,159
and it's closed therefore there is no
 

1255
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,350
and it's closed therefore there is no
need for it

1256
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:13,360
need for it
 

1257
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,669
need for it
makes sense okay thank you for sharing

industry leaders
 

1271
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,230
industry leaders
yeah uh

1272
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:28,240
yeah uh
 

1273
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,029
yeah uh
like at the beginning uh our focus uh

1274
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
like at the beginning uh our focus uh
 

1275
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,630
like at the beginning uh our focus uh
was uh on a polygon ecosystem and on the

1276
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:34,640
was uh on a polygon ecosystem and on the
 

1277
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,549
was uh on a polygon ecosystem and on the
everscale ecosystem and we partnered

1278
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:36,559
everscale ecosystem and we partnered
 

1279
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,990
everscale ecosystem and we partnered
with both of them

1280
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,000
with both of them
 

1281
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,630
with both of them
and we obviously got some benefits from

1282
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:40,640
and we obviously got some benefits from
 

1283
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,190
and we obviously got some benefits from
the rescue ecosystem as well currently

1284
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,200
the rescue ecosystem as well currently
 

1285
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,350
the rescue ecosystem as well currently
we are working with some b2b clients uh

1286
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,360
we are working with some b2b clients uh
 

1287
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,590
we are working with some b2b clients uh
in every scale ecosystem and in some

like every scale products like
 

1311
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,149
like every scale products like
they are something that we are very

1312

00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:22,320
already have tracking functionality for
 

1317
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,390
already have tracking functionality for
every scale and we are familiar

1318
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,400
every scale and we are familiar
 

1319
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,750
every scale and we are familiar
with how

1320
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:25,760
with how
 

1321
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,789
with how
this blockchain works therefore uh it is

1322
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:28,799
this blockchain works therefore uh it is
 

1323
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,110
this blockchain works therefore uh it is
much more suitable for us to create

1324
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,120
much more suitable for us to create
 

1325
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,950
much more suitable for us to create
quests in uh every scale ecosystem that

1326
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:34,960
quests in uh every scale ecosystem that
 

1327
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,029
quests in uh every scale ecosystem that
than in other other blockchains okay

1328
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:39,039
than in other other blockchains okay
 

1329
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,710
than in other other blockchains okay
very interesting

1330
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:40,720
very interesting
 

1331
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,470
very interesting
there's a good question for you guys

1332
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,480
there's a good question for you guys
 

1333
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,230
there's a good question for you guys
here um do you have a referral system

1334
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:48,240

 

1335
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,070

well uh not now uh at this moment uh

1336
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,080
well uh not now uh at this moment uh
 

1337
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,830
well uh not now uh at this moment uh
like we don't have a referral system

1338
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:53,840
like we don't have a referral system
 

1339
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,710
like we don't have a referral system
itself but uh we are working on it and i

1340
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:56,720
itself but uh we are working on it and i
 

1341
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,269
itself but uh we are working on it and i
think that after the second uh version

1342
00:26:59,269 --> 00:26:59,279
think that after the second uh version
 

1343
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,190
think that after the second uh version
of our platform will be published we

1344
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,200
of our platform will be published we
 

1345
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,149
of our platform will be published we
will definitely implement it and uh i

1346
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:04,159
will definitely implement it and uh i
 

1347
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,029
will definitely implement it and uh i
was thinking myself about like the form

1348
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:07,039
was thinking myself about like the form
 

1349
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,510
was thinking myself about like the form
how this referral system can be done and

1350
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:09,520
how this referral system can be done and
 

1351
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,590
how this referral system can be done and
i think that there is a very

1352
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:11,600
i think that there is a very
 

1353
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,110
i think that there is a very
uh very good and native use case uh in

1354
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,120
uh very good and native use case uh in
 

1355
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,789
uh very good and native use case uh in
the field of web three

1356
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:16,799
the field of web three
 

1357
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,230
the field of web three
is to make a doubt

1358
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,240
is to make a doubt
 

1359
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,590
is to make a doubt
like if you uh want to use uh like a

1360
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:21,600
like if you uh want to use uh like a
 

1361
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,350
like if you uh want to use uh like a
referral system just make your down

1362
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:23,360
referral system just make your down
 

1363
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,149
referral system just make your down
bring your friends and make a doubt and

1364
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159
bring your friends and make a doubt and
 

1365
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,310
bring your friends and make a doubt and
