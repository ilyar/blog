um so the funny fact is that employer

1112
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:13,440
um so the funny fact is that employer
 

1113
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,789
um so the funny fact is that employer
could

1114
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:14,799
could
 

1115
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,950
could
could they they actually don't know

1116
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:16,960
could they they actually don't know
 

1117
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,390
could they they actually don't know
about the

1118
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:18,400
about the
 

1119
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,110
about the
situation of their bullets so that's

1120
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120
situation of their bullets so that's
 

1121
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,590
situation of their bullets so that's
it's um it's not reason to blame them

1122
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:23,600
it's um it's not reason to blame them
 

1123
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,590
it's um it's not reason to blame them
because they don't know to

1124
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:25,600
because they don't know to
 

1125
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,510
because they don't know to
where this money comes from and it

1126
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,520
where this money comes from and it
 

1127
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,990
where this money comes from and it
doesn't mean that employer wanted to

1128
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000
doesn't mean that employer wanted to
 

1129
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,750
doesn't mean that employer wanted to
like trick you and want to send you

we group them in uh in three groups it's
 

1169
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,270
we group them in uh in three groups it's
dangerous sources suspicious sources and

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,789
expand evasco's recognition among
engineers in japan

1532
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:14,799
engineers in japan
 

1533
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,470

jpyc is not yet available on everscale

1540
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:30,480
jpyc is not yet available on everscale
 

1541
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,190
jpyc is not yet available on everscale
so realistically from a liquidity

1542
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,200
so realistically from a liquidity
 

1543
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,350
so realistically from a liquidity
perspective it is currently very

1544
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,360
perspective it is currently very
 

1545
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,549
perspective it is currently very
difficult to distribute jpyc on ever

1546
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:38,559
difficult to distribute jpyc on ever
 

1547
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,510
difficult to distribute jpyc on ever
scale

1548
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:39,520
scale
 

1549
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,630
scale
so however the first step for any

1550
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:42,640
so however the first step for any
 

1551
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,590
so however the first step for any
technology is to get engineers

1552
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:45,600
technology is to get engineers
 

1553
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,070
technology is to get engineers
interested in ever scale

1554
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,080
interested in ever scale
 

1555
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,510
interested in ever scale
so therefore

1556
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:49,520
so therefore
 

1557
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,230
so therefore
we concentrated on making engineers

1558
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:52,240
we concentrated on making engineers
 

1559
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,549
we concentrated on making engineers
interested in evasco's technology

1560
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
interested in evasco's technology
 

1561

fortunately some of their participants

1570
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:09,279
fortunately some of their participants
 

1571
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,830
fortunately some of their participants
were interested in everscale

1572
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:11,840
were interested in everscale
 

1573
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,950
were interested in everscale
however

1574
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:12,960
however
 

1575
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,830
however
they were disappointed when i told them

1576
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:15,840
they were disappointed when i told them
 

1577
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,789
they were disappointed when i told them
they

1578
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:16,799
they
 

1579
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,269
they
that they cannot implement

1580
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:19,279
that they cannot implement
 

1581
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,470
that they cannot implement
evm

1582
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:20,480
evm
 

1583
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,990
evm
so of course i told them that the ebm

1584
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,000
so of course i told them that the ebm
 

1585
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,470
so of course i told them that the ebm
workchain will be raised

1586
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:26,480
workchain will be raised
 

1587
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,590
workchain will be raised
then

1588
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:27,600
then
 

1589
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,590
then
they said they would like to try

1590
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:29,600
they said they would like to try
 

1591
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,190
they said they would like to try
everscribe if avm is implemented on a

1592
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:33,200
everscribe if avm is implemented on a
 

1593
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,350
everscribe if avm is implemented on a
pascal

1594
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:35,360
pascal
 

1595
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,909
pascal
so the hacksaw made it clear

1596
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:37,919
so the hacksaw made it clear
 

1597
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,070
so the hacksaw made it clear
that engineers still have a strong

1598
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,080
that engineers still have a strong
 

1599
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,789
that engineers still have a strong
desire for evm so we hope to see the evm

1600
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:44,799
desire for evm so we hope to see the evm
 

1601
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,230
desire for evm so we hope to see the evm
blockchain out as soon as possible

1602
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:48,240
blockchain out as soon as possible
 

1603
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,950
blockchain out as soon as possible
so we will continue to increase evasco's

1604
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:50,960
so we will continue to increase evasco's
 

1605
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,630
so we will continue to increase evasco's
exposure through

1606
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:52,640
exposure through
 

1607
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,350
exposure through
hacksaws and blockchain events

i think that's probably best is if we

1654
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:49,600
i think that's probably best is if we
 

1655
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,909
i think that's probably best is if we
put the questions into text and uh

1656
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:51,919
put the questions into text and uh
 

1657
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,590
put the questions into text and uh
junior can obviously uh read and

1658
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:53,600
junior can obviously uh read and
 

1659
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,950
junior can obviously uh read and
translate them across and we'll come

and it's also a very important project
 

1675
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,070
and it's also a very important project
which is going on in the background so

1676
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,080
which is going on in the background so
 

1677
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,070
which is going on in the background so
very few know about it because the team

1678
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,080
very few know about it because the team
 

1679
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,590
very few know about it because the team
is very focused

1680
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:15,600
is very focused
 

1681
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,310
is very focused
and working very quickly and efficiently

attack on ukraine
 

1689
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,310
attack on ukraine
and the country became understandably

1690
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,320
and the country became understandably
 

1691
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,590
and the country became understandably
concerned about its art its culture

actually a number of people came up with

1880
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:01,599
actually a number of people came up with
 

1881
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,750
actually a number of people came up with
um an idea that

1882
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:03,760
um an idea that
 

1883
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,470
um an idea that
we can help uh by

1884
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:06,480
we can help uh by
 

1885
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,109
we can help uh by
creating an immutable record of museums

1886
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:11,119
creating an immutable record of museums
 

1887
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,550
creating an immutable record of museums
collection

1888
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:12,560
collection
 

1889
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,870
collection
that will be stored forever um on

1890
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:14,880
that will be stored forever um on
 

1891
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,990
that will be stored forever um on
blockchain as evidence as a catalog of

1892
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,000
blockchain as evidence as a catalog of
 

1893
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,750
blockchain as evidence as a catalog of
what the collection

1894
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760
what the collection
 

1895
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,190
what the collection
was a particular time

1896
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:23,200
was a particular time
 

1897
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,230
was a particular time
that

1898
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:24,240
that
 

1899
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,750
that
also obviously opens a possibility for

1900
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:27,760
also obviously opens a possibility for
 

1901
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,670
also obviously opens a possibility for
now museums to

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,589
now museums to
monetize um

1904
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:31,599
monetize um
 

1905
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,069
monetize um
some of the collections that they have

1906
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:34,079
some of the collections that they have

some of the collections that they have
and receive so much needed

1908

obvious that um we should come up with
 

1945
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,270
obvious that um we should come up with
something

treasury and we decided to to
 

2561
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,390
treasury and we decided to to
to implement uh

to implement uh
 

2563
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,710
to implement uh
such dell constructor to um

00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:24,720

 

2565
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,069

to solve those problems and here uh we

2566
00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:28,079
to solve those problems and here uh we
 

2567
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,349
to solve those problems and here uh we
market the main problems that current

2568
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:31,359
market the main problems that current
 

2569
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,069
market the main problems that current
system has because the current uh

and nothing

2584
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:50,720
and nothing
 

2585
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,950
and nothing
so uh here's a

2586
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:52,960
so uh here's a
 

2587
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,670
so uh here's a
well structured solution uh that usually

2588
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:55,680
well structured solution uh that usually
 

2589
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,390
well structured solution uh that usually
suggested uh to implement

2590
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:58,400
suggested uh to implement
 

2591
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,910
suggested uh to implement
like a crm system uh that can

2592
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:01,920
like a crm system uh that can
 

2593
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,990
like a crm system uh that can
solve this task there will be a

2594
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:04,000
solve this task there will be a
 

2595
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,270
solve this task there will be a
responsible persons uh who

2596
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:07,280
responsible persons uh who
 

2597
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,829
responsible persons uh who
who community can choose so

2598
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:09,839
who community can choose so
 

2599
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:10,950
who community can choose so
uh

2600
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:10,960
uh
 

2601
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,109
uh
let me show it then

2602
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:13,119
let me show it then
 

2603
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,470
let me show it then
uh just

2604
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:14,480
uh just

treasures spending yeah
so uh here is it maybe uh will be better

2612
00:50:22,069 --> 00:50:22,079
so uh here is it maybe uh will be better
 

2613
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,589
so uh here is it maybe uh will be better
if i share another presentation maybe

2614
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:25,599
if i share another presentation maybe
 

2615
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,549
if i share another presentation maybe
you will be better if i show the figma

2616
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:28,559
you will be better if i show the figma
 

2617
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,750
you will be better if i show the figma
uh structure

2618
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:31,760
uh structure
 

2619
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,549

the stages
uh the uh dates of the start of this

2750
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:46,240
uh the uh dates of the start of this
 

2751
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,109
uh the uh dates of the start of this
proposal uh he should input the budget

2752
00:53:49,109 --> 00:53:49,119
proposal uh he should input the budget
 

2753
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,109
proposal uh he should input the budget
after stages

2754
00:53:51,109 --> 00:53:51,119
after stages
 

2755
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:52,390
after stages
and

2756
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:52,400
and
 

2757
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,230
and

we'll uh on the fire and finally we will
get the task uh there will be a

2770
00:54:09,589 --> 00:54:09,599
get the task uh there will be a
 

2771
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,109
get the task uh there will be a
responsible person uh for this proposal

2772
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:13,119
responsible person uh for this proposal
 

2773
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,950
responsible person uh for this proposal
um

2774
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:14,960
um
 

2775

this uh proposal this will be divided
for the few stages uh they might be not

2796
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:41,200
for the few stages uh they might be not
 

2797
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,829
for the few stages uh they might be not
only one uh initiator of this contract

2798
00:54:43,829 --> 00:54:43,839
only one uh initiator of this contract
 

2799
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:47,990
only one uh initiator of this contract
because uh as we describe it in the uh

2800
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,000
because uh as we describe it in the uh
 

2801
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,950
because uh as we describe it in the uh
in the dow architecture that uh

2802
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:50,960
in the dow architecture that uh
 

2803
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,230
in the dow architecture that uh
another point uh of the problem that uh

2804
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:54,240
another point uh of the problem that uh
 

2805
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,910
another point uh of the problem that uh
now uh all uh community members has uh

2806
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:57,920
now uh all uh community members has uh
 

2807
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,230
now uh all uh community members has uh
100 000 uh errors on their wallet so uh

2808
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:02,240
100 000 uh errors on their wallet so uh
 

2809
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,470
100 000 uh errors on their wallet so uh
this solution also helps to to make

2810
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:06,480
this solution also helps to to make
 

2811
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,710
this solution also helps to to make
uh to make a pool uh

2812
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:08,720
uh to make a pool uh
 

2813
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,430
uh to make a pool uh
in the smart contract uh they put uh for

2814
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:11,440
in the smart contract uh they put uh for
 

2815
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,150
in the smart contract uh they put uh for
example let's say uh 5 000 errors uh

2816
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:16,160
example let's say uh 5 000 errors uh
 

2817
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,950
example let's say uh 5 000 errors uh
for 20 people they allocate all funds

2818
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960
for 20 people they allocate all funds
 

2819
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,750
for 20 people they allocate all funds
here there and initiator of the contract

2820

some collaboration with with dex uh

3082
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:38,480
some collaboration with with dex uh
 

3083
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,270
some collaboration with with dex uh
developers like if you imagine if dex

3084
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:41,280
developers like if you imagine if dex
 

3085
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,430
developers like if you imagine if dex
developers would give you some token

3086
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:43,440
developers would give you some token
 

3087
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,109
developers would give you some token
which would be a proof that you are

3088
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:45,119
which would be a proof that you are
 

3089
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:47,349
which would be a proof that you are
staking some amount of money in their in

3090
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:47,359
staking some amount of money in their in
 

3091
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:50,150
staking some amount of money in their in
their farm then then you can use that

3092
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:50,160
their farm then then you can use that
 

3093
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,030
their farm then then you can use that
token in in in the governance as well

3094
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:53,040
token in in in the governance as well
 

3095
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,349
token in in in the governance as well
and if you have this oracle who

3096
01:00:55,349 --> 01:00:55,359
and if you have this oracle who
 

3097
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:58,069
and if you have this oracle who
uh like oracle contract who will provide

3098
01:00:58,069 --> 01:00:58,079
uh like oracle contract who will provide
 

3099
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:58,789
uh like oracle contract who will provide
the

3100
01:00:58,789 --> 01:00:58,799
the
 

3101
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,510
the
the the information that that this like

3102
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:01,520
the the information that that this like
 

3103
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,349
the the information that that this like
token costs

3104
01:01:03,349 --> 01:01:03,359
token costs
 

3105
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,670
token costs
some amount of errors

3106
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:05,680
some amount of errors
 

3107
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,630
some amount of errors
uh on the market and then then you

3108
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:08,640
uh on the market and then then you
 

3109
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,829
uh on the market and then then you
actually have like this utility to the

3110
01:01:11,829 --> 01:01:11,839
actually have like this utility to the
 

3111
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:12,870
actually have like this utility to the
world

3112
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:12,880
world
 

3113
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,950
world
but but yeah that's a little bit

3114
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:14,960
but but yeah that's a little bit
 

3115
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,430
but but yeah that's a little bit
complicated system i think and uh

3116
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:17,440
complicated system i think and uh
 

3117
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,309
complicated system i think and uh
yeah and maybe you have some speaking of

3118
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:20,319
yeah and maybe you have some speaking of
 

3119
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:21,510
yeah and maybe you have some speaking of
time frames

3120
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:21,520
time frames
 

3121
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:25,109
time frames
how how do you think how soon can we

3122
01:01:25,109 --> 01:01:25,119
how how do you think how soon can we
 

3123
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,150
how how do you think how soon can we
launch an mvp maybe without this this

3124
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:28,160
launch an mvp maybe without this this
 

3125
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,990
launch an mvp maybe without this this
technical uh

3126
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:30,000
technical uh
 

3127
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,870
technical uh
like st ever and and stuff but but just

3128
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:32,880
like st ever and and stuff but but just
 

3129
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,829
like st ever and and stuff but but just
basic implementation uh how do you think

3130
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:35,839
basic implementation uh how do you think
 

3131
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:38,150
basic implementation uh how do you think
uh how soon we can launch it and then

3132
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:38,160
uh how soon we can launch it and then
 

3133
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,109
uh how soon we can launch it and then
the another question is how will it work

3134
01:01:41,109 --> 01:01:41,119
the another question is how will it work
 

3135
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,190
the another question is how will it work
together with current implementation so

3136
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:43,200
together with current implementation so
 

3137
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,510
together with current implementation so
do you want to replace or do you want

3138
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:45,520
do you want to replace or do you want
 

3139
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,030
do you want to replace or do you want
just to create a separate now

3140
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:49,040
just to create a separate now
 

3141
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,069
just to create a separate now
uh

3142
01:01:50,069 --> 01:01:50,079
uh
 

3143
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,349
uh
regarding the first question uh

3144
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:53,359
regarding the first question uh
 

3145
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:56,390
regarding the first question uh
i don't like this word

3146
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:56,400
i don't like this word
 

3147
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,589
i don't like this word
uh

3148

uh
 

3149
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,990
uh
i can say that uh it might be uh

3150
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:00,000
i can say that uh it might be uh
 

3151
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,390
i can say that uh it might be uh
implemented very fast depends on the

01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:02,400
implemented very fast depends on the
 

3153
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,309
implemented very fast depends on the
community needs

3183
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,510

uh i did it was kind of covered there

3184
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:45,520
uh i did it was kind of covered there
 

3185
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,390
uh i did it was kind of covered there
but i suppose just just uh to get a kind

3186
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:48,400
but i suppose just just uh to get a kind
 

3187
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,109
but i suppose just just uh to get a kind
of shorter summary from your roman um

3188
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:51,119
of shorter summary from your roman um
 

3189
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,029
of shorter summary from your roman um
you mentioned that the uh the kind of

3190
01:02:53,029 --> 01:02:53,039
you mentioned that the uh the kind of
 

3191
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,029
you mentioned that the uh the kind of
threshold the quorum there was five

3192
01:02:55,029 --> 01:02:55,039
threshold the quorum there was five
 

3193
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:57,589
threshold the quorum there was five
million ever if i heard you right

3194
01:02:57,589 --> 01:02:57,599
million ever if i heard you right
 

3195
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,549
million ever if i heard you right
no yeah the current uh

3196
01:03:00,549 --> 01:03:00,559
no yeah the current uh
 

3197
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,069
no yeah the current uh
system

3198
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:02,079
system
 

3199
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:02,789
system
so

3200
01:03:02,789 --> 01:03:02,799
so
 

3201
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:04,870
so
just wondering um kind of how that

3202
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:04,880
just wondering um kind of how that
 

3203
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,589
just wondering um kind of how that
figure was decided upon i mean by what

3204
01:03:07,589 --> 01:03:07,599
figure was decided upon i mean by what
 

3205
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:10,309
figure was decided upon i mean by what
the kind of short simpler version of um

3206
01:03:10,309 --> 01:03:10,319
the kind of short simpler version of um
 

3207
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,109
the kind of short simpler version of um
why why 5 million specifically because

3208
01:03:13,109 --> 01:03:13,119
why why 5 million specifically because
 

3209
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:13,829
why why 5 million specifically because
yeah

3210
01:03:13,829 --> 01:03:13,839
yeah
 

3211
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:15,510
yeah
to ask the difficult questions that that

3212
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:15,520
to ask the difficult questions that that
 

3213
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,390
to ask the difficult questions that that
seems

3214
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:16,400
seems
 

3215
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,109
seems
kind of like i can i can take that i can

3216
01:03:19,109 --> 01:03:19,119
kind of like i can i can take that i can
 

3217
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:20,870
kind of like i can i can take that i can
take this place

3218
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:20,880
take this place
 

3219
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,950
take this place
so the the the everdao currently is just

3220
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:24,960
so the the the everdao currently is just
 

3221
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,390
so the the the everdao currently is just
a fork of bridge down and it has the

3222
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:28,400
a fork of bridge down and it has the
 

3223
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,270
a fork of bridge down and it has the
same totally the same numbers so uh on

3224
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:31,280
same totally the same numbers so uh on
 

3225
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,190
same totally the same numbers so uh on
the bridge thou you have you have the

3226
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:33,200
the bridge thou you have you have the
 

3227
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,950
the bridge thou you have you have the
same quorum and and then the same

3228
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:34,960
same quorum and and then the same
 

3229
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,589
same quorum and and then the same
proposal cost so they they just didn't

3230
01:03:37,589 --> 01:03:37,599
proposal cost so they they just didn't
 

3231
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,589
proposal cost so they they just didn't
change the numbers but anytime you can

3232
01:03:39,589 --> 01:03:39,599
change the numbers but anytime you can
 

3233
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,029
change the numbers but anytime you can
submit a proposal to change this and uh

3234
01:03:43,029 --> 01:03:43,039
submit a proposal to change this and uh
 

3235
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:46,069
submit a proposal to change this and uh
yeah so so it's fully configurable

3236
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:46,079
yeah so so it's fully configurable
 

3237
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:48,230
yeah so so it's fully configurable
so

3238
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:48,240
so
 

3239
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,069
so
yeah yeah i think i think roman just

3240
01:03:50,069 --> 01:03:50,079
yeah yeah i think i think roman just
 

3241
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:51,829
yeah yeah i think i think roman just
said that that currently we have the

3242
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:51,839
said that that currently we have the
 

3243
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:55,510
said that that currently we have the
thresholds

3244
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:55,520

 

3245
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,510

yeah so i was just kind of thinking you

3246
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:57,520
yeah so i was just kind of thinking you
 

3247
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,670
yeah so i was just kind of thinking you
know uh big big drama worst case

3248
01:03:59,670 --> 01:03:59,680
know uh big big drama worst case
 

3249
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,349
know uh big big drama worst case
scenario um

3250
01:04:01,349 --> 01:04:01,359
scenario um
 

3251
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:03,910
scenario um
obviously in the way it's set up then

3252
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:03,920
obviously in the way it's set up then
 

3253
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,630
obviously in the way it's set up then
there's no hypothetical way where some

3254
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:06,640
there's no hypothetical way where some
 

3255
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,950
there's no hypothetical way where some
malevolent doctor evil type could come

3256
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:08,960
malevolent doctor evil type could come
 

3257
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,549
malevolent doctor evil type could come
by what would it be

3258
01:04:10,549 --> 01:04:10,559
by what would it be
 

3259
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,470
by what would it be
i mean a little over two million dollars

3260
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,480
i mean a little over two million dollars
 

3261
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,150
i mean a little over two million dollars
worth of uh ever

3262
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:14,160
worth of uh ever
 

3263
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,990
worth of uh ever
and then lambast the the dell system

3264
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:18,000
and then lambast the the dell system
 

3265
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,270
and then lambast the the dell system

3271
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,069
dastardly deed yeah in the current set
up that that wouldn't

3272
01:04:28,069 --> 01:04:28,079
up that that wouldn't
 

3273
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:30,230
up that that wouldn't
really be possible is what you said i

3274

to decrease uh such amount of tokens uh
 

3279
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,710
to decrease uh such amount of tokens uh
if they're needed and well no what i

3280
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:38,720
if they're needed and well no what i
 

3281
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,710
if they're needed and well no what i
worry is i mean obviously now now that

scaling infinitely two million dollars
 

3287
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:45,990
scaling infinitely two million dollars
is

3288
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:46,000
is
 

3289
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,910
is
you know to some people it could be

3290
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:47,920
you know to some people it could be
 

3291
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,309
you know to some people it could be
quite a small price to

3292
01:04:50,309 --> 01:04:50,319
quite a small price to
 

3293
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:51,349
quite a small price to
perform

3294
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:51,359
perform
 

3295
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:52,950
perform
much much bigger

3296
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:52,960
much much bigger
 

3297
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,870

of usage and the amount of tokens on the
 

3341
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:49,029
of usage and the amount of tokens on the
system then yeah that would answer kind

3342
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:49,039
system then yeah that would answer kind
 

3343
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,670

main problem is that
 

3523
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:33,030
main problem is that
who will be implemented

3524
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:33,040

particularly uh vitalik was tweeting
 

3535
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,349
particularly uh vitalik was tweeting
about which

3536
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:45,359
about which
 

3537
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:47,189
about which
again i'm not sure it's any better than

3538
01:09:47,189 --> 01:09:47,199
again i'm not sure it's any better than
 

3539
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:48,630
again i'm not sure it's any better than
other models but this is definitely

3540
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:48,640
other models but this is definitely
 

3541
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,430
other models but this is definitely
quite unique yeah so yeah a non-token

3542
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:51,440
quite unique yeah so yeah a non-token
 

3543
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,510
quite unique yeah so yeah a non-token
based down model so an interesting thing

3544
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:53,520
based down model so an interesting thing
 

3545
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,669
based down model so an interesting thing
people are looking at at the minute so

3546
01:09:55,669 --> 01:09:55,679
