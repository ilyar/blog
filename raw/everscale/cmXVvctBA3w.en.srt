polkadot
really

360
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:18,880

 

361
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,509

i wish no no i think it was in our

362

363
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,150

365
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,389
categories it was i think cardano
uh if i'm not mistaken and i think there

366
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
uh if i'm not mistaken and i think there
 

367
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,750
uh if i'm not mistaken and i think there
was one inch

368
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:27,760
was one inch
 

369
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,389
was one inch
so those were the two ones worth

370
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
so those were the two ones worth
 

371
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,990
so those were the two ones worth
mentioning and the rest i don't even

372
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
mentioning and the rest i don't even
 

373
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,550
mentioning and the rest i don't even
know

374
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560

 

375
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,310

and i hope the fact that we were not we

376
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
and i hope the fact that we were not we
 

377
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,230
and i hope the fact that we were not we
were platinum sponsors did not help us

378
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
were platinum sponsors did not help us
 

379
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,870
were platinum sponsors did not help us

380
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
to win
 

381
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,110

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120

 

383
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,430

it was good certainly good exposure we

384
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
it was good certainly good exposure we
 

385
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,030
it was good certainly good exposure we
have a lot of things to learn to do

386
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040

better in the future conferences
 

389
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,990
better in the future conferences
i think uh one noticeable lead is that

390
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
i think uh one noticeable lead is that
 

391
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,790
i think uh one noticeable lead is that
uh

392
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
uh
 

393
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,030
uh
i think the defy alliance folks tatiana

394
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,040
i think the defy alliance folks tatiana
 

395
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,269
i think the defy alliance folks tatiana
specifically are talking to

396
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279

two months uh so and you will need to
 

915
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,630
two months uh so and you will need to
implement a tip three esteton uh token

916
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:12,640
implement a tip three esteton uh token
 

917
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,430
implement a tip three esteton uh token
that can be

918
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,440
that can be
 

919
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,470
that can be
used to rob your uh

st token should provide
 

963
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,549
st token should provide
like the same interface as depooled

964
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:06,559
like the same interface as depooled
 

965
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,909
like the same interface as depooled
tokens is likely it's available for for

966
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:09,919
tokens is likely it's available for for
 

967
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,590
tokens is likely it's available for for
staked tokens so kind of transfer

968
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:13,600
staked tokens so kind of transfer
 

969
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,870
staked tokens so kind of transfer
and etc should

should i perform same operations like i
 

973
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,350
should i perform same operations like i
can perform with my state

974

can perform with my state
 

975
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,990
can perform with my state
with this token or or kind of

977
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,310

like what does it mean like token

978
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,320
like what does it mean like token
 

979
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,870
like what does it mean like token
representing the stake

980
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:30,880
representing the stake
 

981
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,669
representing the stake
uh if i understand right i'm not the

982
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:33,679
uh if i understand right i'm not the
 

983

developer
however but the token should be the

986
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:36,960
however but the token should be the
 

987
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,710
however but the token should be the
owner of the stick so and

988
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:38,720
owner of the stick so and
 

989
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,830
owner of the stick so and
whoever owns the token so uh he can

990
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:41,840
whoever owns the token so uh he can
 

991
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,549
whoever owns the token so uh he can
claim

992
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559

the stake from the depot but i might be

994
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,000
the stake from the depot but i might be
 

995
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,789
the stake from the depot but i might be
wrong pavel

996
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:46,799
wrong pavel
 

997
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,990
wrong pavel
are you here maybe you can comment yes

998
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,000
are you here maybe you can comment yes
 

999
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,190
are you here maybe you can comment yes
yes absolutely that's the whole point

1000
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,200
yes absolutely that's the whole point
 

1001
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,230
yes absolutely that's the whole point
so so that's why uh tokens uh

1002
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,240
so so that's why uh tokens uh
 

1003
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,590
so so that's why uh tokens uh
correct this is correct yes

1004
00:23:59,590 --> 00:23:59,600
correct this is correct yes
 

1005
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:13,350
correct this is correct yes
that's why representatives

1006
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,360

 

1007
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,750

is that for ordinary states all tokens

1008
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:15,760
is that for ordinary states all tokens
 

1009
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,789
is that for ordinary states all tokens
are fungible

1010
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799
are fungible
 

1011
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,390
are fungible
but for invested stakes

1012
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:20,400
but for invested stakes
 

1013
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,830
but for invested stakes
they are different depending on number

1014
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:21,840
they are different depending on number
 

1015
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,510
they are different depending on number
of cycles of testing

1016
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:23,520
of cycles of testing
 

1017
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,909
of cycles of testing
so that's a peculiarity which i added

1018
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:25,919
so that's a peculiarity which i added
 

1019
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,430
so that's a peculiarity which i added
into that

1020
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:27,440
into that
 

1021
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,190
into that
proposal

1022
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,200

 

1023
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,950

but it will be fun it will be

1024
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:32,960
but it will be fun it will be
 

1025
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,789
but it will be fun it will be
interesting to have like

1026
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:34,799
interesting to have like
 

1027
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,310
interesting to have like
100 different uh thoughts

1028
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320

 

1029
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,070

how should uh how should this token

1030
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,080
how should uh how should this token
 

1031
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,750
how should uh how should this token
behave uh

1032
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760

smart contract so

1038
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:02,480
smart contract so
 

1039
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,789
smart contract so
it should get the balance uh from the

1040
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
it should get the balance uh from the
 

1041
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,190
it should get the balance uh from the
pool

1042

ah okay so so this this token actually

1044
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:11,600
ah okay so so this this token actually
 

1045
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,230
ah okay so so this this token actually
is not kind of token but is a

uh like uh
kind of some mechanics

1106
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:30,320
kind of some mechanics
 

1107
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,070
kind of some mechanics
which will be possible with uh with this

1108
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,080
which will be possible with uh with this
 

1109
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,470
which will be possible with uh with this
kind of

1110
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:34,480
kind of
 

1111
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,029
kind of
yeah yeah it's it's it's very easy and

1112
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039
yeah yeah it's it's it's very easy and
 

1113
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,390
yeah yeah it's it's it's very easy and
that's why it's very

1114
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
that's why it's very
 

1115
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,230
that's why it's very
exciting uh you can use uh this tokens

1116
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:42,240
exciting uh you can use uh this tokens
 

1117
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,830
exciting uh you can use uh this tokens
like for as a collateral for uh nd5

1118
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:45,840
like for as a collateral for uh nd5
 

1119
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,070
like for as a collateral for uh nd5
so it means that you stake you get you

1120
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,080
so it means that you stake you get you
 

1121
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,310
so it means that you stake you get you
you state focus you get rewards and you

1122
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,320
you state focus you get rewards and you
 

1123
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,430
you state focus you get rewards and you
use that token as a collateral to some

1124
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:53,440
use that token as a collateral to some
 

1125
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,630
use that token as a collateral to some
uh defy to get another another tones

1126
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640
uh defy to get another another tones
 

1127
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,590
uh defy to get another another tones
then you can use those stones for to to

1128
00:26:59,590 --> 00:26:59,600
then you can use those stones for to to
 

1129
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,230
then you can use those stones for to to
stake

1130
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:00,240
stake
 

1131
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,269
stake
uh another dipole so then you can

1132
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:03,279
uh another dipole so then you can
 

1133
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,110
uh another dipole so then you can
increase your yield by using that

1134
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,120
increase your yield by using that
 

1135
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,549
increase your yield by using that
mechanics

1137
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,549

that's great mechanics yeah maybe some

1138
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:14,559
that's great mechanics yeah maybe some
 

1139
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,269
that's great mechanics yeah maybe some
like additional use cases like it it

like additional use cases like it it
 

1141
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,789
like additional use cases like it it
will really help

1142
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:18,799
will really help
 

1143
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,950
will really help
to create maybe better architecture for

everything which from a mistake
 

1161
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,029
everything which from a mistake
will be able to participate in device so

1162
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:41,039
will be able to participate in device so
 

1163
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,310
will be able to participate in device so
we will

we will
 

1165
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,830
we will
get significant boost in liquidity in

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,750
through some derivatives like a stone
it will be more attractive for them and

1200
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:35,760
it will be more attractive for them and
 

1201
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,630
it will be more attractive for them and
in

1202
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:36,640
in
 

1203
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,310
in
texas we will put some liquidity for

1204
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
texas we will put some liquidity for
 

1205
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,310
texas we will put some liquidity for
farming for its token and

1206
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:42,320
farming for its token and
 

1207
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,510
farming for its token and
i think we will create big pool uh tone

1208
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:45,520
i think we will create big pool uh tone
 

1209
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,190
i think we will create big pool uh tone
to tone like one uh and and uh

1210
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,200
to tone like one uh and and uh
 

1211
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,549
to tone like one uh and and uh
aston like another hand and it will be

1212
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:52,559
aston like another hand and it will be
 

1213
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,990
aston like another hand and it will be
i think it will be trade with some

1214
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,000
i think it will be trade with some
 

1215
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,549
i think it will be trade with some
discount to tone and it will be

1216
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:56,559
discount to tone and it will be
 

1217
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,990
discount to tone and it will be
they'll be very interesting opportunity

1218
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,000
they'll be very interesting opportunity
 

1219
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,590
they'll be very interesting opportunity
for trading

1220
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:03,600

 

1221
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,310

so it will cost a little bit less than

1222
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:06,320
so it will cost a little bit less than
 

1223
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,269
so it will cost a little bit less than
original tone

1224
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:07,279
original tone
 

1225
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,510
original tone
or more i think it will be cost less but

1226
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:11,520
or more i think it will be cost less but
 

1227
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,230
or more i think it will be cost less but
uh market will show

1228
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:16,240

 

1229
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,350

like okay yeah i saw i saw before

1230
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,360

uh we already successfully transferred
 

1313
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,070
uh we already successfully transferred
tip3 tokens with uh

tip3 tokens with uh
 

1315
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,789
tip3 tokens with uh
in the bridge but at that point we only

1316
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:04,799
in the bridge but at that point we only
 

1317
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,870
in the bridge but at that point we only
had one relay node

1318
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:06,880
had one relay node
 

1319
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,350
had one relay node
uh in stage three of the bridge

1320
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:09,360
uh in stage three of the bridge
 

1321
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,950
uh in stage three of the bridge
development the main task was

1322
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:10,960
development the main task was
 

1323
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,310
development the main task was
uh distribution of relay responsibility

1324
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:14,320
uh distribution of relay responsibility
 

1325
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,470
uh distribution of relay responsibility
we will go step by step just like the

1326
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:16,480
we will go step by step just like the
 

1327
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,230
we will go step by step just like the
last time and explain what we're doing

1328
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,240
last time and explain what we're doing
 

1329
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,590
last time and explain what we're doing
while we're doing this

1330
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:19,600
while we're doing this
 

1331
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,710
while we're doing this
in order to show this okay uh as you

1332
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:22,720
in order to show this okay uh as you
 

1333
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,149
in order to show this okay uh as you
can you see the screen now yes yes

00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:26,159
can you see the screen now yes yes
 

1335
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,630
can you see the screen now yes yes
okay very good uh we started the two

1336
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:28,640
okay very good uh we started the two
 

1337
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,470
okay very good uh we started the two
nodes which is a free tone and another

1338
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:30,480
nodes which is a free tone and another
 

1339
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,070
nodes which is a free tone and another
substrate base node

1340
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,080
substrate base node
 

1341
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,110
substrate base node
and we run a setup which sends the

1342
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,120
and we run a setup which sends the
 

1343
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,029
and we run a setup which sends the
initial value to contracts and deploy

1344
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:37,039
initial value to contracts and deploy
 

1345
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,470
initial value to contracts and deploy
them to a local tone

1346
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:38,480
them to a local tone
 

1347
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,470
them to a local tone
also set up the substrate node for

1348
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:40,480
also set up the substrate node for
 

1349
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,630
also set up the substrate node for
interacting with dot on protocol

1350
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:42,640
interacting with dot on protocol
 

1351
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,470
interacting with dot on protocol
we are waiting for the container to

1352
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:44,480
we are waiting for the container to
 

1353
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,950
we are waiting for the container to
finish setup

1354
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:46,960
finish setup
 

1355
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,750
finish setup
by the way this uh setup now it also

1356
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:49,760
by the way this uh setup now it also
 

1357
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,230
by the way this uh setup now it also
deploys the first relay node

1358
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:52,240
deploys the first relay node
 

1359
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,549
deploys the first relay node
uh now we need to start many relay nodes

1360
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:56,559
uh now we need to start many relay nodes
 

1361
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,950
uh now we need to start many relay nodes
in this contest in order to show that

1362
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:58,960
in this contest in order to show that
 

1363
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,630
in this contest in order to show that
the distribution of really no

1364
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:00,640
the distribution of really no
 

1365
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,549
the distribution of really no
notes exist and we named them

1366
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:04,559
notes exist and we named them
 

1367
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,630
notes exist and we named them
alice bob and charlie which is just

1368
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:06,640
alice bob and charlie which is just
 

1369
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,230
alice bob and charlie which is just
random names that we've

1370
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:08,240
random names that we've
 

1371
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,750
random names that we've
chosen okay

1372
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:13,760

 

1373
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,830

now we're still waiting for the initial

1374
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:15,840
now we're still waiting for the initial
 

1375
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,750
now we're still waiting for the initial
setup to finish and

1376
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:17,760
setup to finish and
 

1377
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,310
setup to finish and
well like i said maybe you you can

1378
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,320
well like i said maybe you you can
 

1379
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:20,950
well like i said maybe you you can
describe

1380
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:20,960
describe
 

1381
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,190
describe
uh what you are going to present so

1382
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:23,200
uh what you are going to present so
 

1383
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,310
uh what you are going to present so
which which features

1384
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:24,320
which which features
 

1385
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,350
which which features
exactly uh well

1386
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360
exactly uh well
 

1387
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,870
exactly uh well
today the main uh feature which is

1388
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:30,880
today the main uh feature which is
 

1389
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,870
today the main uh feature which is
uh distribution of the relays

1390
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:32,880
uh distribution of the relays
 

1391
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,789
uh distribution of the relays
responsibility

1392
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:34,799
responsibility
 

1393
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,950
responsibility
basically means that there will be not

1394
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:36,960
basically means that there will be not
 

1395
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,070
basically means that there will be not
one but

1396
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,080
one but
 

1397
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,590
one but
three relay nodes and there will be

1398
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:41,600
three relay nodes and there will be
 

1399
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,830
three relay nodes and there will be
some stage of choosing who is voting for

1400
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:43,840
some stage of choosing who is voting for
 

1401
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,909
some stage of choosing who is voting for
the proposal and who is not voting for

1402
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:45,919
the proposal and who is not voting for
 

1403
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,190
the proposal and who is not voting for
for the proposal to simplify it in a

1404
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:49,200
for the proposal to simplify it in a
 

1405
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,350
for the proposal to simplify it in a
very simple way um unfortunately the

1406
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:51,360
very simple way um unfortunately the
 

1407
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,029
very simple way um unfortunately the
presentation is a little bit

1408
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:53,039
presentation is a little bit
 

1409
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,549
presentation is a little bit
um more like uh console run

1410
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:56,559
um more like uh console run
 

1411
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,230
um more like uh console run
uh but now okay we are ready to continue

1412
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,240
uh but now okay we are ready to continue
 

1413
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,070
uh but now okay we are ready to continue
now we are starting the first the layman

1414
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,080
now we are starting the first the layman
 

1415
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,230
now we are starting the first the layman
which called the alice

1416
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,240
which called the alice
 

1417
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,750
which called the alice
and after which we need to deploy the

1418
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:07,760
and after which we need to deploy the
 

1419
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,909
and after which we need to deploy the
rest relay nodes which is bob and

1420
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:09,919
rest relay nodes which is bob and
 

1421
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:18,549
rest relay nodes which is bob and
charlie so we're deploying both

1422
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:18,559

 

1423
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,950

one second yeah it's done and now we

1424
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:20,960
one second yeah it's done and now we
 

1425
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,190
one second yeah it's done and now we
need to check the log

1426
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,200
need to check the log
 

1427
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,110
need to check the log
no okay let's let's stop the charlie

1428
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,120
no okay let's let's stop the charlie
 

1429
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,230
no okay let's let's stop the charlie
first

1430
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,240

 

1431
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,149

okay we deployed the charlie now we need

1432
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:30,159
okay we deployed the charlie now we need
 

1433
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,269
okay we deployed the charlie now we need
to open the lock windows for alice

1434
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:33,279
to open the lock windows for alice
 

1435
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,430
to open the lock windows for alice
bob and charlie which which are three

1436
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:35,440
bob and charlie which which are three
 

1437
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,350
bob and charlie which which are three
relay notes basically

1438
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,360
relay notes basically
 

1439
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,509
relay notes basically
one second

1440
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:45,519

 

1441
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,909

okay so at this setup what we have

1442
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:49,919
okay so at this setup what we have
 

1443
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,389
okay so at this setup what we have
created is three delay nodes

1444
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:52,399
created is three delay nodes
 

1445
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,669
created is three delay nodes
uh in this

1446
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:55,679
uh in this
 

1447
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,669
uh in this
demonstration two of them should be

1448
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:57,679
demonstration two of them should be
 

1449
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:58,950
demonstration two of them should be
active at any

1450
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:58,960
active at any
 

1451
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,070
active at any
one time so what we created three three

1452
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,080
one time so what we created three three
 

1453
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,990
one time so what we created three three
delay nodes but only two would have to

1454
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,000
delay nodes but only two would have to
 

1455
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,110
delay nodes but only two would have to
vote

1456
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,120
vote
 

1457
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,349
vote
uh it's it's done on a purpose

1458
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:09,359

 

1459
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,709

so

1460
00:34:10,709 --> 00:34:10,719
so
 

1461
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,629
so
[Music]

1462
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:12,639
[Music]
 

1463
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:19,030
[Music]
make run pop okay

1464
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,040

 

1465
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,109

no we still we're still opening the log

1466
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:21,119
no we still we're still opening the log
 

1467
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,710
no we still we're still opening the log
windows which we will need

1468
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,720
windows which we will need
 

1469
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,710
windows which we will need
a little bit later in the demonstration

1470
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:24,720
a little bit later in the demonstration
 

1471
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,470
a little bit later in the demonstration
to see that the

1472
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:26,480
to see that the
 

1473
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,669
to see that the
uh the chosen node

1474
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:29,679
uh the chosen node
 

1475
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,069
uh the chosen node
is working properly so we can see what's

1476
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:32,079
is working properly so we can see what's
 

1477
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,550
is working properly so we can see what's
going on okay

1478
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:36,560

 

1479
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,349

so we are starting the charlie node and

1480
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:39,359
so we are starting the charlie node and
 

1481
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,629
so we are starting the charlie node and
going to

1482
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:40,639
going to
 

1483
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:47,510
going to
look of the charlie

1484
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:47,520

 

1485
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,149

okay so now we have basically three

1486
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:50,159
okay so now we have basically three
 

1487
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:50,790
okay so now we have basically three
windows

1488
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:50,800
windows
 

1489
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,629
windows
with three logs of three layers on the

1490
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:52,639
with three logs of three layers on the
 

1491
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,669
with three logs of three layers on the
screen right now as you can see

1492
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:55,679
screen right now as you can see
 

1493
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,670
screen right now as you can see
yes yes okay our relaying nodes

1494
00:34:59,670 --> 00:34:59,680
yes yes okay our relaying nodes
 

1495
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,190
yes yes okay our relaying nodes
sending the public keys to vrf results

1496
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,200
sending the public keys to vrf results
 

1497
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,630
sending the public keys to vrf results
and signatures

1498
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:04,640
and signatures
 

1499
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,750
and signatures
to both chains and our algorithm

1500
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:07,760
to both chains and our algorithm
 

1501
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,990
to both chains and our algorithm
is sorting relaying nodes in accordance

1502
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:10,000
is sorting relaying nodes in accordance
 

1503
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,150
is sorting relaying nodes in accordance
to via ref results and signatures

1504
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:12,160
to via ref results and signatures
 

1505
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,750
to via ref results and signatures
in order to choose the active relay

1506
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:13,760
in order to choose the active relay
 

1507
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,589
in order to choose the active relay
nodes i'm sorry it might sound

1508
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:15,599
nodes i'm sorry it might sound
 

1509
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,109
nodes i'm sorry it might sound
complicated but it's actually very

1510
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:17,119
complicated but it's actually very
 

1511
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:17,990
complicated but it's actually very
simple

1512
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,000
simple
 

1513
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,430
simple
uh basically in the background we

1514
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:21,440
uh basically in the background we
 

1515
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,150
uh basically in the background we
seeing the two active nodes and one

1516
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,160
seeing the two active nodes and one
 

1517
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,349
seeing the two active nodes and one
inactive node

1518
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:25,359
inactive node
 

1519
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,390
inactive node
to simplify it that's all uh

1520
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:28,400
to simplify it that's all uh
 

1521
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,990
to simplify it that's all uh
it's a lot of text on the screen but it

1522
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,000
it's a lot of text on the screen but it
 

1523
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,670
it's a lot of text on the screen but it
will be all right

1524
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:31,680
will be all right
 

1525
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,950
will be all right
so to um to sort of

1526
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:34,960
so to um to sort of
 

1527
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,430
so to um to sort of
see that it's working properly we will

1528
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:37,440
see that it's working properly we will
 

1529
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,310
see that it's working properly we will
transfer

1530
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:38,320
transfer
 

1531
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,430
transfer
funds from uh

1532
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:41,440
funds from uh
 

1533
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,950
funds from uh
from substrate node to a free tone node

1534
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:44,960
from substrate node to a free tone node
 

1535
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,190
from substrate node to a free tone node

of tokens from
 

1549
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,349
of tokens from
substrate account to let's see the

substrate account to let's see the
 

1551
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,510

to see
when the relay node will show us the

1592
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:01,680
when the relay node will show us the
 

1593
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,030
when the relay node will show us the
that it's got the event

1594

inactive so we will not see the active
 

1645
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:08,710
inactive so we will not see the active
sign as the

we just
showing that the balance has changed

1676

showing that the balance has changed
 

1677
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,349
showing that the balance has changed
which means the tone balance

1678
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:45,359
which means the tone balance
 

1679
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,349
which means the tone balance
is updated and the transaction is

1680
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:49,359
is updated and the transaction is
 

1681
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,710
is updated and the transaction is
final basically that's all we have

1682

what's the chime in when are we going to

1744
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:06,240
what's the chime in when are we going to
 

1745
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,510
what's the chime in when are we going to
see the volcano

1746
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:07,520
see the volcano
 

1747
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,510
see the volcano
you know bridge in the final shape

1748
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:11,520
you know bridge in the final shape
 

1749
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,790
you know bridge in the final shape
um yeah it's a it's a very good question

1750
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:14,800
um yeah it's a it's a very good question
 

1751
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,910
um yeah it's a it's a very good question
it's uh it depends on many many things

1752
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:17,920
it's uh it depends on many many things
 

1753
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,630
it's uh it depends on many many things
uh in including not only our team of

1754
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:20,640
uh in including not only our team of
 

1755
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,309
uh in including not only our team of
developers

1756
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:22,319
developers
 

1757
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,870
developers
so we are i'm not quite ready to say the

1758
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:24,880
so we are i'm not quite ready to say the
 

1759
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,069
so we are i'm not quite ready to say the
exact date and time

1760
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:28,079
exact date and time
 

1761
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,670
exact date and time
i can probably guess that it will

1762
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:31,680
i can probably guess that it will
 

1763
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,030
i can probably guess that it will
happen uh right after the last stage of

1764
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,040
happen uh right after the last stage of
 

1765
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,470
happen uh right after the last stage of
the bridge which will implement

1766
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:36,480
the bridge which will implement
 

1767
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,910
the bridge which will implement
both economics and slashing conditions

1768
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:39,920
both economics and slashing conditions
 

1769
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,030
both economics and slashing conditions
and rights after so

1770
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:43,040
and rights after so
 

1771
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,230
and rights after so
it is generally

1772
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:46,240

 

1773
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,670

00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:53,200
yeah like bridges are not my
 

1777
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,870
yeah like bridges are not my
strongest uh uh understanding

1778
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:56,880
strongest uh uh understanding
 

1779
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,349
strongest uh uh understanding
but but uh nevertheless the question is

1780

but but uh nevertheless the question is
 

1781
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,030
but but uh nevertheless the question is
uh as far as i know

1782
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,040
uh as far as i know
 

1783
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,829
uh as far as i know
uh in polka that we have uh kind of

1784
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:03,839
uh in polka that we have uh kind of
 

1785
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,190
uh in polka that we have uh kind of
power chains

1786
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,200
power chains
 

1787
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,309
power chains
and is it is that bridge can organize

1788
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:08,319
and is it is that bridge can organize
 

1789
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,030
and is it is that bridge can organize
communication

1790
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,040
communication
 

1791
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,109
communication
between arbitrary parachain and

1792
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:11,119
between arbitrary parachain and
 

1793
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,630
between arbitrary parachain and
arbitrary for it on

1794
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:12,640
arbitrary for it on
 

1795
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,470
arbitrary for it on
like um

1796
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:16,480

 

1797
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,270

yeah like favorite on my net or

yeah like favorite on my net or
 

1799
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,630
yeah like favorite on my net or
or it it just communicates must change

00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:24,640
or it it just communicates must change
 

1801
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,470
or it it just communicates must change
of of this blockchains

1802
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:30,480

 

1803
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,589

uh yes evan i'm sorry uh yes this
 

1805
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,069
uh yes evan i'm sorry uh yes this
product

1806
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:34,079
product
 

1807
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,910
product
is uh developed with parachains

1808
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:37,920
is uh developed with parachains
 

1809
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,069
is uh developed with parachains
there are some uh can can you hear me

1810
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:40,079
there are some uh can can you hear me
 

1811
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,150
there are some uh can can you hear me
there are some exceptions that my

there are some exceptions that my
 

1813
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,910
there are some exceptions that my
um so to simplify yes it is

1814
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:45,920
um so to simplify yes it is
 

1815
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,430
um so to simplify yes it is
made on parachains but if you need to

1816
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:49,440
made on parachains but if you need to
 

1817
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,349
made on parachains but if you need to
get in a little bit deeper into this

1818
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:51,359
get in a little bit deeper into this
 

1819
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,510
get in a little bit deeper into this
subject i suggest

1820
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:53,520
subject i suggest
 

1821
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,190
subject i suggest
like write it down and we can

1822
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,200
like write it down and we can
 

1823
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,030
like write it down and we can
communicate in

1824
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,040
communicate in
 

1825
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,829
communicate in
more common language okay

1826
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:00,839
more common language okay
 

1827
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,589
more common language okay
okay

1828
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:03,599
okay
 

1829
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,109
okay
so it's kind of deep right yes it's not

1830
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:07,119
so it's kind of deep right yes it's not
 

1831
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,589
so it's kind of deep right yes it's not
on the surface

1832
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:09,599
on the surface
 

1833
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,390
on the surface
to be exact i'm not technically deep and

1834
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:12,400
to be exact i'm not technically deep and
 

1835
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,829
to be exact i'm not technically deep and
i might say

1836
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:13,839
i might say
 

1837
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,150
i might say
something not exactly correct but it is

1838
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,160
something not exactly correct but it is
 

1839
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,990
something not exactly correct but it is
yes generally speaking yes it is

1840
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,000
yes generally speaking yes it is
 

1841
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,589
yes generally speaking yes it is
developed with power chains of course

1842
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:19,599
developed with power chains of course
 

1843
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,390
developed with power chains of course
yes

1844
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:22,400

 

1845
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,910

okay and as as far as we know uh brox's

1846
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:25,920
okay and as as far as we know uh brox's
 

1847
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,430
okay and as as far as we know uh brox's
ethereum bridge is made in a way that

1848
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:29,440
ethereum bridge is made in a way that
 

1849
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,630
ethereum bridge is made in a way that
it can broadcast arbitrary
