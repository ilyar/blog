hi nom
hi have you tried the butter
not yet but i have seen that it's
working
usually instead of
um know
putting a an alarm clock for
the time of the zoom i just enter ahead
of time
yeah i can imagine i understand
understand because there are some kind
of
gap on uh youtube
uh there are there are missing
recordings you mean i i just used to
like
listen pose like before i get sleep
and i found that there is
there are maybe three or four latest
calls
missing yeah actually it's uh
because uh roman who who normally
uploads
them so had some issues with internet
connection and
as videos are quite heavy so
he wasn't able to upload this on time
but he started to to put it there one by
one
and hopefully they will soon all be will
be there
there was one call i guess it was 27
or 26 that for some reason didn't record
so unfortunately we lost it but all the
rest should be uploaded
all right let's start then uh actually
we have some people here already and all
the rest who didn't come
it's their fault absolutely because they
will miss an interesting discussion
i hope uh let me
go through the agenda and uh tell what
we're going to discuss today so
first of all i'd like to give some
updates on the contests and
then uh a short announcement about the
cross chain meetup
that will uh take place in moscow today
and also i would like to discuss today
uh the topic of uh
decentralized lending so uh
starting from the contest uh actually
there is only three days left to vote
for the polka dot bridge stage three
uh and there are still uh still
too few votes if if nothing at all uh
so i not not no votes at all
so that that's uh really discourages me
and uh i hope the jurors will
be able to finally put their votes on
the submission
and i hope that they are taking their
time just to bet analyze the work
if not uh so next time i will announce
the next
jury contest because we need some active
members who
are ready to dedicate the time to vote
for for the submissions and they are not
that many
actually and yeah so
we need to do something with the jurors
activity
uh if you have some ideas about people
who can join us
and help us make jury more active and
involved so please do not hesitate to
invite
and i think i will prepare the proposal
for the next time uh
next announcement is about the second uh
defy alliance meetup that is called the
cross chain meet up so we are going to
host a very interesting discussion and
presentations
by polka dots alana
cosmos waves
and freetown of course so and we will
have a panel discussion
uh about the future of cross chain
interaction
and some topics that will
be arising and very soon like
uh of course ethereum to zero
again was postponed to 2023 but
uh still uh one day it will come and
as most of these uh chains
they uh take the likability from from
ethereum from current
inefficient ethereum implementation uh
it's one they may uh really affect them
and there will be also some other
additional interesting questions that
will be discussed on this panel
and we have good speakers today some of
them will be offline some of them will
be online so uh
if even if you are not in moscow so do
not hesitate to
uh hop on on our online stream
and take a look of what's going on
and if you are in moscow so there is
absolutely no chance for you to miss
this right
i think it will be very very interesting
uh yeah so that's it for announcements
and
it's happening today it will start
actually in
two and a half hours in hype city near
the moscow city
so i can just one second i will tag
once again the
event uh in our defy group
yeah i did this so uh if you want to
to sign up or just take the link it's
clck the for online translation if
you're
not speaking russian so uh
yeah just hop on and listen because it's
very interesting
so let's
go to the interesting part of today's
call so
uh unfortunately i didn't manage to to
get some some
speakers for today's call although uh
i'm still trying to do so
and got some guys from both
centralized and decentralized platforms
for landing
hopefully maybe for the next next call
or the call
after so we will get some guests
who will uh tell us more about the
landing
uh in the real world the crypto landing
and actually uh there are uh two
absolutely different areas that
that we're going to discuss so the first
one uh
is called collateralized lending uh it's
actually secured landing
in other words that uh you use
your own assets as a collateral to get
some other
assets that's pretty easy as it sounds
and another more complex and more
interesting topic is
uh the unsecured lending uh which
requires significantly
bigger infrastructure and
it will come in the later stages
but we will touch this also as well
uh so i would like to start
from just giving some some insights on
the market so
uh on active players uh and
who are currently uh in this market so
i will start from centralized
organizations and we will come
to the defy ones of course and
we'll just uh explain a bit about
the how landing in defy world works
uh if you don't i didn't dig into it so
i found a couple of good articles
to tell about this so first of all
starting from centralized
lending there are currently not that
many uh big organizations and
one of the biggest and the oldest one is
of course nexon
uh so they are currently more like a
bank
already and they even issue the
credit cards uh and give some other
products
but still they are centralized
centralized platform that require you to
pass kyc
and story of funds in in the custody
so it's a custodial way but nexo
actually played a very very good
role in the market and showed how
it can be done differently from the
traditional banking
and it's a big big thanks to them uh
because they were
pioneers of this area uh the next one to
mention is a block fee
that was hacked recently and you may
have seen some news about this
so the hackers stole
stole some some millions of dollars from
from the
custody unfortunately because blockfield
was one of the
challengers for the fonexo and they were
delivering very good and sophisticated
products
uh was a very good ui uh i hope that
they will recover
and they will manage to to over overcome
this this crisis
uh uh the one also worth to mention in
the celsius network
uh they uh started actually the first
the first celsius model uh i remember
when i was talking to them
a couple of years ago when they were
just starting uh
they were already approaching the defy
approach so
kind of uh decentralized uh landing when
they're
or p2p landing actually uh
it it was a bit different different
pros and was used by nexo where an exo
pro position themselves like a central
counterparty where you
you put your funds for deposit
or take for credit
uh and but now celsius actually
evolved into yet another centralized
institution that you can use to to
borrow some funds
uh of course this could not uh last
too long when you
when the defy started to evolve
in the defy
notion actually started to
show up in news headlines
in 2019 and then we started to
to see the first purely decentralized
protocols to to appear
the first one uh is uh to name is of
course uh
eth land which is now famously known as
abe so they actually created the first
ecosystem smart contracts
which was used to
serve as a decentralized collateralized
borrowing and lending platform they
proposed
they value the in three areas so first
of all is of course uh
it's a money market uh where the lending
protocols
uh this lending protocol that allows the
creation of decentralized money markets
that anyone from the world can access uh
with the crypto assets
without kyc without minimum deposits
without any country restriction and
anyone can earn interest on deposits
that are done to the smart contracts
uh second proposition was uh to the app
builders
and uh that will help differently apps
to enhance the
functionality and offer much much more
features to the users uh
i i can just name uh those like argent
like not just save or instadep
so uh they integrated uh other protocol
uh with a smart contracts and now users
of these platforms also can enjoy
uh some london borough features and last
but not least
of course crypto traders so who really
uh
were seeking for some leverage
to trades on the market especially
when there is a high gross
opportunity and they
didn't want to sell the uh main assets
so they
could easily stake it on our and
get so desired additional liquidity to
trade
uh yeah actually
this was three key value propositions by
other and
uh speaking of use cases uh
these were uh a bit bigger number of
them
so first of all uh users
uh were seen of like a savings account
which uh
which was allowing you actually not to
uh
to make your funds work and get some
interest on top of
it and users were depositing funds
in in the smart contracts and the assets
were available to borrowers
and uh albert
designed the smart contract in such a
way that
deposits are always greater than the
total borrow so
actually uh there is
almost almost of course there is always
an opportunity but
in the real world users
will be able to withdraw their funds
normally except for the situation of
bankrupt
so it's pretty much like traditional
banks work as well
so they offer a bit higher rate on the
credits and
a bit lower rate on the deposits and
normally uh
they should keep the resource that will
allow to sustain a normal withdrawals
operation
by the busy clients
next this case it was a traditional loan
uh
so when crypto users who are in the need
of cash
could use the protocol to borrow some
usd stable coins
uh then withdraw to them to the bank
accounts through
some some gateways or
theater frames and uh then they could be
used for
different purposes from uh covering some
pending bills and living expenses to
some funding
or business ventures and uh
currently uh if you have a look on
what uh lending protocols offer so the
rates on loans are significantly better
than the centralized counterparts
just just for instance if you try to
take
a usdc loan from block fee
it will offer it to you with the apr of
setting
roughly 16 and uh if you take it from
others so it will uh
be something like under five percent
which which is a significant difference
when you consider
uh even all the transactional costs that
may occur when you're interacting with
decentralized application
of course there is
a specific use case that is more
suitable for western countries
which is called tax advantages when
you need some liquidity and you don't
have to sell
actually your your basic asset because
in case you sell it uh you have to
report to tax inspection
on the income earned and pay
some taxes uh so in this case when you
just
uh stake it and take some additional
money
uh as as a loan so you don't have to
to pay this tax it it
makes may sound not really important
for for most of countries but if you
speak about
citizens of usa or some european
countries like germany or france
so it is a significant benefit for them
flash loans of course this is a unique
feature that was initially offered by
other that
allowed smart contracts to borrow from
the protocol
without collateral and the only
requirement was
that they should pay the loan back
within the same transaction block and
thanks to
the ethereum design which releases
blocks
uh well roughly roughly in 10 minutes
if i'm drunk so uh it's well enough time
to perform your operations
and actually the flash loans were
offered up to 25 000
k dollars
yeah maybe now they say even higher
there is a lot a lot of information
about flash loans and
i remember that some of you already were
asking about the the possibility to
implement flash loans
on free tone but unfortunately we cannot
enjoy this because
on friton blocks appear significantly
far faster than one ethereum
the next the next
proposal is for smart contract wallets
where the app developers who were
responsible for creating smart contract
wallets
could also offer some lending services
to the users
and such wallets were aggregating the
best rates from
all known and audited lending protocols
and users could easily select where they
better deposit the the funds or withdraw
the funds
margin trading of course uh i will not
just uh
just just name it so everyone
understands what this is and
uh there are some two specific cases
also
that appeared with uh some decentralized
learning protocols of the first one is
the concept of yield bots
um so this is a decentralized uh
way of finding the better better
place so it's an automated money
management tool
so it what it actually does it scans the
best offering from the market
compares and automatically moves your
liquidity from one protocol to another
so uh it's it's a very good idea and i
hope that such
thing will one day appear on the
fritonica system because
uh it actually shows that there is
tremendous amount of liquidity and a
very big
number of successful market players
that can compete with each other and
this competition is always good for
for the whole platform and another
concept is
liquidators so we also uh touch this
concept a few times if i
if i'm not wrong
this is the way how uh
leading protocols deal with
margin calls when someone
doesn't return the loan on time
so actually uh it's as simple as selling
as
a basic asset as a discount rate to the
market
and those
players those users who are called
liquidators
so they uh compete with each other for
liquidating this position because if you
get uh
an instant exposure five percent to the
market you can
later uh using your arbitrary
strategy so it's very good and this
liquidation
institute so uh is very good
for all the lending and i think that it
will definitely appear
in native return protocols as well
speaking about tokenomics
and yeah just to mention that i'm now
telling all this on the basis of other
because it's one of the most advanced uh
platforms that is dominating over the
market like bitcoin
on all the uh crypto markets but
uh all other protocols work pretty much
the same
so they differ in some peculiar details
and
uh but uh generally speaking they are
all very similar so uh about economics
uh actually all other loans they
have some uh 0.01
of origination fee and 80 percent
of this fee is used to buy uh
other governance tokens from the market
uh to burn its supply and organically
push the price of this this government's
talking up
which which is quite a smart way uh and
of these uh this origination fee
uh goes to the referral program uh in
its own
uh referral fees uh so they're splitted
between
lenders and borrowers uh like 40 to 260
and they are paid to the protocols
that have integrated uh
other for the users and
users of these protocols can
stake or borrow money and the protocol
itself
gets rewarded then we have
so-called a tokens it's after
other in compound for instance you have
c tokens soft
after compound uh so these are special
tokens that are issued against
your staked liquidity
and this works pretty similar to
robton that we are using uh in our
solutions
uh because sometimes uh
it is easier for you to have a uniform
tokens that you can build
smart contract logic about
and this talking station one to one of
course uh ratio
and uh you get rewarded in these
tokens actually when you for example
stake
stake your your funds uh
also our plans now to introduce some
economics updates
and uh so we uh we're all waiting for
what it will be because uh like we
learned from uni swap examples so
the third version uh differs
significantly from the second one
and maybe maybe other will propose
something
something really new to the market uh
i also selected other because it's one
of the
uh ones the platforms who offers the
most wide variety of tokens that can be
useful in
london and borrowing uh it supports now
more than 20 tokens
uh its nearest uh competitor compound
supports on the
motor 3.8 so
but the quantity of course does not
reflect the quality here
and we need to understand that other uh
do this because it can actually
uh yeah so and if we uh
have a sneak peek on the default pulse
and select the lending section so we can
see that
currently the lending market uh
has a total value locked of 33 billion
dollars already
where other dominates with 27
and uh actually there are not so many
protocols
who have more than one billion dollars
locked they
are actually six including also maker
dao
instadap liquity and alpha homora
but uh alfajomora and instadep
they are not uh independent uh in terms
of liquidity so
because instadep for example uh relies
on
a makering compound whereas alfa hamora
relies on guinea swap and sushi swamp so
and the liquidity is kind of mixed
and the total number is also not that
big so it's 27 of them on the divi pulse
and most of them is uh under 30 million
value locked so you see that they cannot
compete
in that sense to the market leaders
yeah that's that's pretty it's about the
market overview uh
and what i want to discuss
is uh how do we approach the lending
uh in freetown so what should we start
from
and
which contest should we host for uh for
for the first
uh iteration so who wants to to start
these guys raisins
nobody really
all right maybe landing is not the most
interesting part for the defying
system of return
no maybe we need to think about this
yeah uh maybe i should start actually
landing can be
implemented in different ways of course
and
the most obvious the most understandable
way
is just copy our or compound
mechanics and just port them to to
to the free tone another another way
uh is to attract one of the market
leaders
and discuss with them the pilot with
with free tone when they could implement
the mechanics themselves
the third way is to think on how uh
such lending and borrowing protocols can
be
uh reworked to benefit from freetown
peculiarities like
a fully decentralized nature and
faster capital moving
[Music]
or maybe we can can as a force option
uh think about serving
uh some layer 2 solution
for this protocols on free tom through
the bridges for instance
what do you think
yes anzar please um yeah i think
that as soon as we get to to the point
where um
where d5 is more developed in the free
tone as soon as we get to
working taxes and uh well
working for some time bridges for for
some more time and
uh attract some more liquidity i think
we can we can
definitely start with with option one
because
that's practically what is happening
with some of the taxes
right now uh with uh
where we just take something that works
really well already and just sport it to
free ton
and use all the good stuff that is in
freetown
but i think that maybe
yeah just now i i'm thinking that option
one is is actually a lot slower
than the option two okay the second one
you told about uh just agreeing with
this yes network cell on the partnership
supports the solution i think
the second option might be a lot faster
but
well it requires uh well someone who
negotiates that to to sell free tone as
the good solution for uh
for landing yeah so
i i won't really tell any new things
uh now because i didn't really have time
to to think
a lot about that but i think the second
so the second option is probably the
uh the one that can be started like
right now
i mean it's it's it doesn't require
to develop anything it just requires a
good sort of
like well it does require to to think
through the
the the the
the good things that the the potential
partner would get from that
and how the free tonic system is about
to
to to benefit from that i think that's
that's one of the uh that's the the
option that
can be chosen like
today tomorrow or something like that
yeah
okay okay thank you by the way do you
plan to support some margin
uh instruments for your for your decks
uh we have a lot of plans for future but
yeah let's
uh yeah well i think in the in due time
we'll
yeah but actually it's it's it's an
obvious uh idea that
lays just just on the ground because
if you uh i i was on the
definition uh conference the official
hackathon conference
a couple of days ago and there was uh a
very good
uh report from sergey gursky from
uh uh
how's this found it's called i forgot
sorry uh yeah actually what's what's he
told
yes thank you thank you so uh he told
the idea
that actually uh triggered me to to dig
him
deeper in houses the current uh
defy market works is that all the
protocols are really
tightly entangled so if you uh have a
look
for example uh
at some exchanges so they are deeply
entangled with credit protocols if you
have a look
on credit protocol they are entangled
with the insurance protocols where nz
parts
uh rely on exchanges again to
for certain reasons and uh it's kind of
spaghetti market
and uh it appeared
not not for without not without reason
actually and uh of course it's always
worth to rely on some
um some good solutions instead of
creating your own one once and you
better
focus on your own business and take uh
some good make some good partnerships
with other protocols
that will enhance your user experience
uh and i think that this question
uh will soon later appear in fritonica
system as well
uh because right now we see that we
are kind of uh like wild wild west
when everyone is settling their own
ecosystems and
we see which one will emerge faster and
dominate the market but later
the more products you have the more
difficult it is
to maintain them and one day
you may decide that you want to focus
and this is the point uh where
you will start looking for some
partnership and existing solutions and
see uh who does better what
and start integrating with them and uh
thankfully
uh on blockchain it's it's uh quite
quite easy to do then in in the real
world with all these kycs and
all this stuff
yeah sure about the margin trading i
think
we we probably what i'm thinking of now
is sort of like a roadmap roadmap for
d5 that is more global that like
has all these milestones like
okay in in like two months we have uh
we'll have a bridge and a few taxes and
like what else nfc marketplace
already almost i think yeah i i think
there's definitely a few solutions out
there
i didn't test them all but i think
there's
definitely going to be something working
like this summer
and having new users
so like well
nft is a different branch but still it's
very
it might be closely related to the taxes
and to
well movement of liquidity so
yeah back to the roadmap i think maybe
we should
like have have it in advance to sort of
plan and see uh when
when those contests should be designed
uh so that we when the when those little
bricks
or parts are ready we get right to that
and start start building uh new stuff
and start well advertising outside of
the
free tone because again i think that
we would have like two or three times
as many solutions and contestants for
the
contests and more well
more and better products uh if we
if we made the world if we if we
told the world about how cool our
contests are
and how how easy it is to you to get
into them and to
to make some great products and to start
stuff and to to win prizes
so uh i'm i'm not sure maybe there is
such a road map
maybe i'm actually uh i
remember that we have only one roadmap
that was initially created
at the moment of setting the device up
garbage
and i agree that maybe it is
the right moment in time when we should
update it actually
and we could even run a small
contest with some some small prizes
for for those who could take the lead on
that
and create a well-done road map
taking into account current market
trends and the grounding
why this or that
movement should be done on this topic on
the next one
yeah why not
yeah i think if if we make a contest we
should maybe think of some way to
uh to make it uh to make the product of
that contest
last so that we don't have
a an outdated roadmap in a few months
again
yes i mean yes like to to make it
like maybe a vested reward that
uh for updating yeah yeah yeah so
so there's like i don't know a committee
for that roadmap or
or a few or like a team that is uh
responsible for updating it and uh
well maybe with an analytics of
governments uh or some other one
uh to sort of analyze the current trends
in the uh in a some in some
sophisticated fashion so that
for sure that this is the best that
well this is like the the
this is like the best data that we can
present to the freedom community
yes yes we understand where where we
should move
and to understand where uh
where our products should be heading and
to
sort of advise to the teams that are uh
creating stuff and defy where to
where to move next and to properly plan
and sort of well coordinate and partner
in
to make freetown as
as attractive as possible for people who
are looking to
maybe move from ethereum or to people
from
who are looking for new d5 systems yeah
and
yeah i agree uh maybe it should be
divided into two parts actually the
first one is analysis of the current
defined trends
and some arising trends because uh
what i learned from from that conference
from definition is that
actually there are some protocols that
do not did not release yet
actually and they may have some
interesting proposals for the market and
that are solving certain uh certain
pains
and uh another in uh based on this
analysis
so uh we can uh create
a bit longer roadmap for for the for the
freight on the ecosystem and
see a bit further than few months
so what will be going on
okay thank you uh any other ideas guys
please
do not be shy we are all friends here
well what one question what is the
status for
or oracle contest uh oracle contest
is uh ongoing one
just let me check so so when when is
charging an implementation stage
uh currently it's already in the
implementation stage it's uh 20 days
left
so it's it will end on july the 8th
and after that i think it will be a
couple of weeks
for for judging
okay well so so basically i would like
to
prioritize lending protocol so create
the contest and it should be very simple
so we basically need
to uh to put collateral in tone
and to get uh usd or usdc or
like or uh wrapped version of die
so like this is quite simple it's like
terra
anchor protocol works so they put luna
and get the usd so we can
choose like three stable coins that we
have dropped
in uh in friton and just so the only
prerequisite is uh
the oracle because we need to to
have the price of the tone to to get
liquidated so
and to prioritize it because i think
that we need to
so focus now on on building primary
financial instruments
rather than planning uh like long-term
uh development because like so it's
it it can be a waste of time so i would
suggest to create prayer financial
primitives
first then go with uh long-term planning
how we will
um how we'll create new products because
like i think that
there is a problem in coordination so
when the
the couple of teams or several teams
working on one
uh on one type of product which is not
like very
uh you know very very productive so it's
basically
the best for the market so the market
will choose
the most convenient solution but in
terms of the uh
competitive competition with other
chains it's like waste of time
so basically i think that we need to
create financial primitives
for the first and then like decide
probably we need
to allocate some capital to the
concrete team not like a contest
uh for some products um
very important for infrastructure and
then like make contests for
like um layer two uh products i mean
layer two like not
uh that utilized uh financial primitives
rather than
create the simple like swapping or loan
or like deposit so like something like
uh
automated
to be pestici done very soon
in order to acquire new because like
it's very
uh it's very so what is landing
basically
it's the uh it's a tool to
reduce the selling pressure on the tone
so basically those who need liquidity
will not
sell token yeah will not send
the the s the coin they will just put it
as a collateral on take the short term
liquidity in the entire
usdc so this this is very
um like it will have a good
uh uh good effect on
on on the price of stone so so basically
the market cap
of the whole ecosystem uh will will be
um beneficiary of this
so so i would i would suggest to do like
to
create the proposal very quickly and
just set it up
and to to be ready to test it when
uh when the oracle is uh provided so so
we can
so we can have the the working product
by that time okay uh in this case uh
i i'm not sure that you will get the
product by that time when the oracle
contest is finished because you first of
all need to integrate with this solution
and understand how how it works and
there can be different
different implementations although there
is one architecture
so but still it can vary in
implementations
i agree that uh primitives uh
are important but i disagree that we
need to focus just on one solution
because you never know which solution is
better and
uh in my opinion competition is good
because
you never know which exact protocol
will uh will get
more popular more stable and more secure
and that's why we are discussing now so
how we should approach this
this thing and and when by the way you
had
a very good uh presentation on financial
primitives
an architecture of the financial system
shown the first meet up of the fire
lines
maybe you can share it also here in defy
group
and we can also discuss this
i what i would do actually is
keeping in mind the oracle's
architecture that is currently being
implemented hopefully by
by several teams i would
run a short contest for two
or three weeks for some
uh landing architecture
including the um
peculiarity of free tone compared to
ethereum for example and it shouldn't be
with a big budget definitely but
uh it can at least help us to collect
ideas and select
the better architecture from scratch so
and not that like every team should
think about uh
inventing their own will
yes ivan yeah uh speaking about
like that we need to streamline
implementation
i'm sorry uh speaking about that that we
need to streamline the implementation of
financial primitives
uh and uh i i i just uh
think that they not really
depends depend on oracle's because
like oracle is a kind of a price
provider right and you can mock
it so we can kind of start
developing this financial primitives
assuming that oracle's are already here
and
replace the real oracles with some
interface and as far as
like these oracles will be implemented
they will just
like incorporate in the existing
financial primitives implementation
and so we can parallelize this uh
yeah probably probably yeah
so it will be just split into phases
like the first phase
is the implementation of uh financial
primitives just a business logic of
business logic of it assuming some uh
kind of
a mock-up mock of oracle and the second
stage is just integration with uh
with oracle solutions which will came up
in in the nearest time it really
uh you know my question is
is oracle obligatory for lending and
borrowing protocol
or there is an alternative without using
the oracle
yeah there is an alternative to
to put uh the risk of undeclared
assets to borrowers to not to borrow
splendors cylinders
yes but it's basically not
it's not a good path to to follow yeah
so i i probably
i will agree with ivan because like so
oracle is like
a microservice for for this for this
product
so it's like a service you can just mock
it and create the whole logic
just put a constant price of uh free
tone
as one or two or five as you like and
just create
the the whole object and and then when
the oracle is
is ready i think that the the team that
will
done the the best oracle solution
will be eager to like integrate the
oracle into your product
so there will be some like synergy
between two teams that are working on
on two products so so basically
because this team that is creating their
oracle will be
uh more likely interested in integrating
into in
spreading the usage and use cases of
their own
oracle solution so basically i think
that we need to start
um like soon to
the solution uh so the the context of
landing
is quite it's not very uh
straightforward like
it's it's very straightforward in
business logic but it is not
straightforward in terms of the
uh asynchronous uh nature of uh
free time transactions but like i i
think that
in a month or in the months and a half
that the solution will be ready
without uh oracle pricing then we will
work
uh so i'm not really like these two
teams will work
on uh like making the final product with
oracle
thank you um so
how would uh you see the next steps so
in the end do we need the architecture
contest
because i remember and i agree with
meters that we should
because you never know maybe there is
some genius idea
lying just nearby you don't see it and
this way we let people to
to bring it to the surface or we just
start with a simple implementation
immediately and we'll see
how teams has implemented this
yeah well actually i have i have a
little input on that
uh that not that
lending without without oracles
is indeed possible and it it is not
really
so risky as you say so you you don't
really need
to put a risk on a on a loaner
but you also can like involve some
third-party insurance provider which
will put some stake
and earn rewards and some token and
there is a project
in in in ontology ecosystem
i i'm not really remember it called
weakness yes
and there is also next mutual who does
this
yeah well yeah i don't know who will who
will really do it but but
the the the idea is just here in the
ecosystem so
well yeah just a note
[Music]
okay
uh okay so i i still
i see uh here some
some questions uh a big number of
questions actually so
on how to do this so uh
what i would propose is still
run short short contest
for not even uh as a well-detailed
architecture but
maybe uh a cell-like uh
thought on how the landing in friton
could be formal specification right
informal specification yeah just maybe
uh
to create a fruitful ground for ideas
uh for implementation and right after
uh have provided to teams who would like
to participate in the implementation
contest
uh because in any case everyone will be
implementing their
own architecture and we learned this
from our past contests
but if we can help them with giving them
some
some some information some alternative
views
on this on this issue uh it may
result in better products
do you think
yeah that's good so we can like start
with uh
business logics uh essay or like
specification technical requirements
then
and go into the implementation stage
in this case uh i propose
maybe i will draft this contest tomorrow
and
let's just launch it from monday and uh
give
one i think one week will be enough for
such an insane
and right after so we'll follow the
first stage of
implementation of the of the lending
protocol
by the way uh uh the what is the status
for
a state stone version uh talking contest
it's launched actually and it will last
for
uh two months so it's 53 days left
so uh it's it
in it's in a structural uh
phase or in implementation
implementation so actually
we discussed this uh several times and
decided that uh to launch it
right away so we just detailed the
specification with pavel
and now it seems seems okay
and we will see the current uh
what we will get from from teams
actually okay right
all right so we have five more minutes
guys
uh if you have any other opinions please
please express yourself
i i would i would kindly ask ignore to
share
his uh his you said presentation or or
some maybe
either a recording on financial
primitives because
i i i think that there are a lot of
people in communities that are not
really involved in finance
and uh ignorance like
background on finance will be really
helpful for developers
he already did this it's in defy group
i pinned this to to the top
because i remember there was a quite
good introduction on the
sequence actually of financial
instruments
uh that should be implemented it is uh
the slide number four
actually so the zero level
infrastructure level
and financial primitives and basic
middleware then
uh advanced uh middleware and basic
financial products and finally some
structured financial products
uh this is yeah this is quite a quite
quite nice
thing to ground the roadmap
okay uh
i think that we have no more time for
for discussions so
uh just just a kind of reminder to those
who joined us later
so uh especially to jurors we
have three days to vote for the police
stage 3
submission there is only one so please
take your time and
put your score on it in
eight days we'll end the second stage of
the freethrown decks implementation
so if you are developing something so
you still have time to submit
and the voting will start in a bit more
than a week
and also there are 12 days late left
for the self-sovereign identity
framework implementation
so also if it's the topic interested
interesting for you so please submit
and validate our oracle and staton so we
already discussed this
so that's pretty it for today and uh i i
really thank you everyone for attending
and uh
i invite you to think more on the
lending
and what can be the lending protocol
on friton native to freetown and
let's launch the essay contest on monday
to get some ideas
so thank you everyone bye bye and see
you
in the meet up who's in moscow
bye bye guys
adios
