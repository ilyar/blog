but in the usa is another agency you
 

153
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,670
but in the usa is another agency you
know

154
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
know
 

155
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,309
know
in the u.s so but it's still one

156
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
in the u.s so but it's still one
 

157
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:08,869

159
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,149
internet
so one psn so yeah uh but the

160
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
so one psn so yeah uh but the
 

161
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,270
so one psn so yeah uh but the
the reason for that uh split up because

162
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280
the reason for that uh split up because
 

163
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,550
the reason for that uh split up because
the the regulations in china

164
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
the the regulations in china
 

165
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,949
the the regulations in china
it doesn't support public chain and it

166
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
it doesn't support public chain and it

so by the outside we need you know

170
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
so by the outside we need you know
 

171
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,390
so by the outside we need you know
because

172
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
because
 

173
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,589
because
biasing integrates all kind of uh

174
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
biasing integrates all kind of uh
 

175
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,550
biasing integrates all kind of uh
technol blockchain technology so outside

176
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
technol blockchain technology so outside
 

177
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,110
technol blockchain technology so outside
china we can integrate public chains

178
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
china we can integrate public chains
 

179
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,670
china we can integrate public chains
so and and you know support the public

180
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
so and and you know support the public
 

181
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,309
so and and you know support the public
chains

182
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
chains
 

183
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,869
chains
so uh that's why we split uh governance

184
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
so uh that's why we split uh governance
 

185
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,470
so uh that's why we split uh governance
supply into two

186
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
supply into two
 

187
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,229
supply into two
so and uh since november we already uh

188
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
so and uh since november we already uh
 

189
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,430
so and uh since november we already uh
we integrate the you know more

190
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
we integrate the you know more
 

191
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,470
we integrate the you know more
more technology we integrate

192
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
more technology we integrate
 

193
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,509
more technology we integrate
the the you know the uh remote public

194
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:55,519
the the you know the uh remote public
 

195
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,229
the the you know the uh remote public

but most importantly is in china

198
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
but most importantly is in china
 

199
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,949
but most importantly is in china
we launched what we call the open

200
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
we launched what we call the open
 

201
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,789
we launched what we call the open
permission machine

202
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799

00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
project uh the we call the opb
 

205
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,670
project uh the we call the opb
what opb is is basically because in

206
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
what opb is is basically because in
 

207
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,309
what opb is is basically because in

it's not really you know

210
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,360
it's not really you know
 

211
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,390
it's not really you know
legal to basically run the public chain

212
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
legal to basically run the public chain
 

213
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,189
legal to basically run the public chain
nodes

214
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199

215
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,390
nodes
okay and and and also which means for

216
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
okay and and and also which means for
 

217
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,509
okay and and and also which means for
chinese developers

218
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
chinese developers
 

219
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,590
chinese developers
it's really it's actually very

220
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
it's really it's actually very
 

221
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,510
it's really it's actually very
troublesome for them to connect to a

222
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
troublesome for them to connect to a
 

223
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,629
troublesome for them to connect to a
public team

224
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
public team
 

225
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,350
public team
and under and and they cannot buy

226
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
and under and and they cannot buy
 

227
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,790
and under and and they cannot buy
cryptocurrency so

228
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
cryptocurrency so
 

229
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,430
cryptocurrency so
they actually cannot pay for the gas uh

230
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
they actually cannot pay for the gas uh
 

231
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:33,830
they actually cannot pay for the gas uh
on

232
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
on
 

233
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,550
on
on the public chain but because china is

234
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
on the public chain but because china is
 

235
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,909
on the public chain but because china is
really push for the blockchain

236
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
really push for the blockchain
 

237
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,030
really push for the blockchain
technology and then

238
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
technology and then
 

239
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,749
technology and then
you know it's really moved fast you know

240
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
you know it's really moved fast you know
 

241
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,590
you know it's really moved fast you know
therefore the other developer

242
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:43,600
therefore the other developer
 

243
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,749
therefore the other developer
also can get familiar with this kind of

244
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
also can get familiar with this kind of
 

245
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,350
also can get familiar with this kind of
public exchange environment

246
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
public exchange environment
 

247
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,230
public exchange environment
development environment public chain so

248
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
development environment public chain so
 

249
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,870
development environment public chain so
so

250
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
so
 

251
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,830
so
so we will launch the open permission

252
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
so we will launch the open permission
 

253
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,629
so we will launch the open permission
blockchain

254
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
blockchain
 

255
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,830
blockchain
project which is we bring the public

and the so-so so chinese developer and

268
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
and the so-so so chinese developer and
 

269
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,029
and the so-so so chinese developer and
the chinese business

270
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
the chinese business
 

271
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,469
the chinese business
they can use this permission version

272
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
they can use this permission version
 

273
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,950
they can use this permission version
of a public exchange environment and to

274
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
of a public exchange environment and to
 

275
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,590
of a public exchange environment and to
develop

276
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
develop
 

277
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,870
develop
their own applications uh similar to the

278
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
their own applications uh similar to the
 

279
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,749
their own applications uh similar to the
public chain

280
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
public chain
 

281
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,430
public chain
and because there are no

282
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
and because there are no
 

283
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,270
and because there are no
cryptocurrencies so they pay

284
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
cryptocurrencies so they pay
 

285
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,749
cryptocurrencies so they pay
the gas with fair money so we need to

286
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
the gas with fair money so we need to
 

287
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,990
the gas with fair money so we need to
build the the gateways payment gateways

288
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
build the the gateways payment gateways
 

289
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,909
build the the gateways payment gateways

have a quick follow-up question so

308
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
have a quick follow-up question so
 

309
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,510
have a quick follow-up question so
um how does psn evaluate projects to

310
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
um how does psn evaluate projects to
 

311
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,590
um how does psn evaluate projects to
import them and what's the main criteria

312
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
import them and what's the main criteria
 

313
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,870
import them and what's the main criteria
for that uh the the first one

314
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
for that uh the the first one
 

315
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,909
for that uh the the first one
is uh it's the device diversify

316
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:05,919
is uh it's the device diversify
 

317
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,309
is uh it's the device diversify
which means we don't want just use one

318
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
which means we don't want just use one
 

319
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,670
which means we don't want just use one
uh technology

320
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
uh technology
 

321
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,670
uh technology
even with our interchange services we

322
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
even with our interchange services we
 

323
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,830
even with our interchange services we
use two unaware ideas through the third

324
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
use two unaware ideas through the third
 

325
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,950
use two unaware ideas through the third
one the first one

326
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
one the first one
 

327
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,710
one the first one
so uh the first one is divide diversify

328
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
so uh the first one is divide diversify
 

329
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,749
so uh the first one is divide diversify
and the next one is

330
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
and the next one is
 

331
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,070
and the next one is
you know it's really really good for

00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
you know it's really really good for
 

333
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,950
you know it's really really good for

to develop applications okay that's a

336
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840
to develop applications okay that's a
 

337
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,230
to develop applications okay that's a

all the things and we have a system that
 

945
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,110
all the things and we have a system that
is a uh self-developed uh uh

946

concept from

950
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,360
concept from
 

951
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,270
concept from
the polka's parachute but we achieve it

952
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,280
the polka's parachute but we achieve it
 

953
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,310
the polka's parachute but we achieve it
different way and

954
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,320
different way and
 

955
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,669
different way and
which way to actually early than polka

956
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,679

 

957
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,270

so if because the public machine

1228
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:46,240
so if because the public machine
 

1229
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,789
so if because the public machine
has cryptocurrencies so you can see most

1230
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:48,799
has cryptocurrencies so you can see most
 

1231
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,310
has cryptocurrencies so you can see most
most almost 99

it's no longer a public chain because a

it's no longer a public chain because a
 

1333
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:29,830
it's no longer a public chain because a
lack of

so i i think there will be a niche
 

1347
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,590
so i i think there will be a niche

after that these are come out with the

1356
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:56,880
after that these are come out with the

that's for developers let's say it's

1360
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:00,960
that's for developers let's say it's
 

1361
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,149
that's for developers let's say it's

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,750
and they go into china and they go as a
opv right open permission blockchain

1538
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:49,760
opv right open permission blockchain
 

1539
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,590
opv right open permission blockchain
and the the the

00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:53,600
and the the the
 

1541
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,870
and the the the
lack of the algo within china forcing

1542
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:56,880
lack of the algo within china forcing
 

1543
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,070
lack of the algo within china forcing
them to

00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,080
them to
 

1545
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,750
them to
focus or experiment with maybe

00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:01,760
focus or experiment with maybe
 

1547
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,789
focus or experiment with maybe
in the future with the dcep from china

1548
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:04,799
in the future with the dcep from china
 

1549
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:05,830
in the future with the dcep from china
to substitute that

1550
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:05,840
to substitute that
 

1551
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,269
to substitute that
and make it into a very stable

1552
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:09,279
and make it into a very stable
 

1553
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,990
and make it into a very stable
value when you you don't have to uh

1554
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,000
value when you you don't have to uh
 

1555
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,669
value when you you don't have to uh
worry about the fluctuation in this

1556
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:13,679
worry about the fluctuation in this
 

1557
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,789
worry about the fluctuation in this
in the exchange market about

1558
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:16,799
in the exchange market about
 

1559
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,669
in the exchange market about
the value right and and that i think is

1560
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:19,679
the value right and and that i think is
 

1561
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,070
the value right and and that i think is
open

1562
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,080
open
 

1563
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,230
open
for a lot of niche application for the

00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:22,240
for a lot of niche application for the
 

1565
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,789
for a lot of niche application for the
future for people to explore that

1566
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:24,799
future for people to explore that
 

1567
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,430
future for people to explore that
and if that will further accelerate the

1568
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,440
and if that will further accelerate the
 

1569
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,070

interesting blockchain applications i

1580
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:41,039
interesting blockchain applications i
 

1581
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,110
interesting blockchain applications i
think that is actually very good

1582
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,120
think that is actually very good
 

1583
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,590
think that is actually very good
so i really agree with that point of

1584
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:45,600
so i really agree with that point of
 

1585
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,149
so i really agree with that point of
view

1586
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:46,159
view
 

1587
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,990
view
now on the other side i also think it's

1588
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,000
now on the other side i also think it's
 

1589
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,430
now on the other side i also think it's
interesting to look at

1590
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:49,440
interesting to look at
 

1591
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,669
interesting to look at
this is algorand going from outside into

1592
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:51,679
this is algorand going from outside into
 

1593
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,950
this is algorand going from outside into
china but the

1594
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:52,960
china but the
 

1595
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,669
china but the
opposite direction i think is also um

1596
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:55,679
opposite direction i think is also um
 

1597
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,389
opposite direction i think is also um
becoming

1598
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:56,399
becoming
 

1599
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,510
becoming
um the future uh trends

1600
00:29:59,510 --> 00:29:59,520
um the future uh trends
 

1601
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,190
um the future uh trends
for example i see some of the very

1602
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,200
for example i see some of the very
 

1603
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,029
for example i see some of the very
famous um

1604
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:03,039
famous um

permission blockchain live because in

1606
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,080
permission blockchain live because in
 

1607
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,549
permission blockchain live because in
china

1608
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:06,559
china
 

1609
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,510
china
which is uh quite widely adopted now

1610
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:09,520
which is uh quite widely adopted now
 

1611
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,230
which is uh quite widely adopted now
because

1612
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,240
because
 

1613
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,909
because
they are not allowed to do uh

1614
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:11,919
they are not allowed to do uh
 

1615
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,909
they are not allowed to do uh
permissionless blockchain in china so

1616
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:13,919
permissionless blockchain in china so
 

1617
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:14,389
permissionless blockchain in china so
they

1618
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:14,399
they
 

1619
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,710
they
force them to do it outside china if

1620
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:16,720
force them to do it outside china if
 

1621
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,830
force them to do it outside china if
there's a need

1622
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:17,840
there's a need
 

1623
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,549
there's a need
if they can use hong kong as a place to

1624
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:20,559
if they can use hong kong as a place to
 

1625
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,070
if they can use hong kong as a place to
launch it and use the hong kong

1626
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,080
launch it and use the hong kong
 

1627
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,830
launch it and use the hong kong
developers that's our hope that we will

1628
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:23,840
developers that's our hope that we will
 

1629
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,750
developers that's our hope that we will
attract a lot to developer to help to

1630
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:25,760
attract a lot to developer to help to
 

1631
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,630
attract a lot to developer to help to
build this

1632
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:26,640
build this
 

1633
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,110
build this
application and this new application in

1634
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,120
application and this new application in
 

1635
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,750
application and this new application in
the future

1636
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:29,760
the future
 

1637
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,830
the future
could be something interesting to

1638
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:31,840
could be something interesting to
 

1639
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,590
could be something interesting to
combine some of the

1640
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:33,600
combine some of the
 

1641
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,070
combine some of the
permissioned nature in china and the

1642
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,080
permissioned nature in china and the
 

1643
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,950
permissioned nature in china and the
permission less

1644
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:36,960
permission less
 

1645
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,269
permission less
nature outside china now a lot of new

1646
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:39,279
nature outside china now a lot of new
 

1647
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,029
nature outside china now a lot of new
innovation i think could happen in the

1648
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:41,039
innovation i think could happen in the
 

1649
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:41,669
innovation i think could happen in the
future

1650
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:41,679
future
 

1651
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,230
future
using that hybrid model so i'm very

1652
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:44,240
using that hybrid model so i'm very
 

1653
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,190
using that hybrid model so i'm very
optimistic about this kind of trends

1654
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,200
optimistic about this kind of trends
 

1655
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,549
optimistic about this kind of trends
and let me jump in a little bit so

1656
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:50,559
and let me jump in a little bit so
 

1657
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,190
and let me jump in a little bit so
but for bsn we are integrating our

but for bsn we are integrating our
 

1659
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,750
but for bsn we are integrating our
blockchain technology so we

1660
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:55,760
blockchain technology so we
 

1661
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,230
blockchain technology so we
we we actually is neutral okay we

1662
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,240
we we actually is neutral okay we
 

1663

so we see a lot of us cases so we see

1670
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:05,360
so we see a lot of us cases so we see
 

1671
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,750
so we see a lot of us cases so we see
there's a need for open permission in

1672
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:07,760
there's a need for open permission in
 

1673
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,630
there's a need for open permission in
china and

1674
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:08,640
china and
 

1675
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,070
china and
also we see a need for non

1676
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,080
also we see a need for non

actually talking a lot with speakers

1734
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:14,799
actually talking a lot with speakers
 

1735
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,269
actually talking a lot with speakers
about interoperability

1736
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:17,279
about interoperability
 

1737
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,789
about interoperability
and the importance of cross-chain

1738
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:18,799
and the importance of cross-chain
 

1739
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,710
and the importance of cross-chain
features are there any services

1740
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:20,720
features are there any services
 

1741
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,110
features are there any services
represented for cross-chain needs in

1742
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,120
represented for cross-chain needs in
 

1743
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,830
represented for cross-chain needs in
in bsn and what is the main challenge

1744
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:25,840
in bsn and what is the main challenge
 

1745
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,269
in bsn and what is the main challenge
here

1746
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:27,279
here
 

1747
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,549
here
actually uh actually there's two uh two

1748
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:30,559
actually uh actually there's two uh two
 

1749
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,950
actually uh actually there's two uh two
major points why we even do bsn the

1750
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:32,960
major points why we even do bsn the
 

1751
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,750
major points why we even do bsn the
first one is

1752
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:33,760
first one is
 

1753
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,789
first one is
reduce the cost like everybody even high

1754
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:36,799
reduce the cost like everybody even high
 

1755
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,710
reduce the cost like everybody even high
school students they can access to

1756
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:38,720
school students they can access to
 

1757
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,310
school students they can access to
blockchain technology okay

1758
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:40,320
blockchain technology okay
 

1759
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,470
blockchain technology okay
it should be very cheap to build the

1760
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
it should be very cheap to build the
 

1761
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,230
it should be very cheap to build the
privacy and the tests all

1762
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,240
privacy and the tests all
 

1763
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,470
privacy and the tests all
it should be very cheap to access any

1764
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:46,480
it should be very cheap to access any
 

1765
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,350
it should be very cheap to access any
public chain and

1766
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,360
public chain and
 

1767
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,990
public chain and
they can test you know the technology so

1768
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,000
they can test you know the technology so
 

1769
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,630
they can test you know the technology so
so that's

1770
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:50,640
so that's
 

1771
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,310
so that's
that's the first point the second one

1772
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,320
that's the first point the second one
 

1773
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,230
that's the first point the second one
actually is the interpretability

1774
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:54,240
actually is the interpretability
 

1775
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,549
actually is the interpretability
because we consider right now uh no

1776
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:56,559
because we consider right now uh no
 

1777
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,990
because we consider right now uh no
matter if it's privacy

1778
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,000
matter if it's privacy
 

1779
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,870
matter if it's privacy
or a public chain they are like internet

1780
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:00,880
or a public chain they are like internet
 

1781
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,710
or a public chain they are like internet
in the early 1990s

00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:02,720
in the early 1990s
 

1783
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,269
in the early 1990s
okay because eventually they should link

1784
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:05,279
okay because eventually they should link
 

1785
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,070
okay because eventually they should link
together

1786
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,080
together
 

1787
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,149
together
the data flows from one chain to

1788
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:08,159
the data flows from one chain to
 

1789
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,750
the data flows from one chain to
inaudible

1790

know we all see how internet changed

1798
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,120
know we all see how internet changed
 

1799
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,350
know we all see how internet changed
everything in our life so i think

1800
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:21,360
everything in our life so i think
 

1801
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,110
everything in our life so i think
eventually there will be something

1802
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,120
eventually there will be something
 

1803
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,509
eventually there will be something
to connect all the chains for example

1804
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:25,519
to connect all the chains for example
 

1805
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,310
to connect all the chains for example
from

1806
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:26,320
from
 

1807
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,789
from
a smart contract from one chain to call

1808
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:28,799
a smart contract from one chain to call
 

1809
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,310
a smart contract from one chain to call
another smart contract on

1810
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:30,320
another smart contract on
 

1811
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,230
another smart contract on
another chain to transfer assets to

1812
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:32,240
another chain to transfer assets to
 

1813
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,789
another chain to transfer assets to
transfer data should be very very easy

1814
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:34,799
transfer data should be very very easy
 

1815
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,990
transfer data should be very very easy
so so so that's why one major

1816
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,000
so so so that's why one major
 

1817
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,029
so so so that's why one major
major focus of bsn is

1818
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:41,039
major focus of bsn is
 

1819
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,149
major focus of bsn is
to build the interoperability within bsn

1820
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
to build the interoperability within bsn
 

1821
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,870
to build the interoperability within bsn
just remember within bison we have ides

1822
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:46,880
just remember within bison we have ides
 

1823
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,830
just remember within bison we have ides
for anything

1824
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:47,840
for anything
 

1825
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,310
for anything
we have ids for any smart contract we

1826
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:50,320
we have ids for any smart contract we
 

1827
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,470
we have ids for any smart contract we
have ids for you know all the

1828
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:52,480
have ids for you know all the
 

1829
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,870
have ids for you know all the
you know data centers so we can easily

1830
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:54,880
you know data centers so we can easily
 

1831
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,710
you know data centers so we can easily
to find other genes

1832
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:56,720
to find other genes
 

1833
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,950
to find other genes
on the open internet it's hard to find

1834
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:58,960
on the open internet it's hard to find
 

1835
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,830
on the open internet it's hard to find
other things

2087
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,310
okay 10 years 10 years after
1995. so so so blockchain technology

2088
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:18,320
1995. so so so blockchain technology
 

2089
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,670
1995. so so so blockchain technology
will be quicker

2090
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:19,680
will be quicker
 

2091
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,750
will be quicker
but it still takes a while okay right

2092
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:21,760
but it still takes a while okay right
 

2093
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,510
but it still takes a while okay right
now people say what's blockchain

2094
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:23,520
now people say what's blockchain
 

2095
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,630
now people say what's blockchain

into their commercial it system so so

2118
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:52,640
into their commercial it system so so
 

2119
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,430
into their commercial it system so so
there will be

there will be
 

2121
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,990
there will be
many many user cases and that will also

2122
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,000
many many user cases and that will also

plus a cbdc well
 

2171
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,430
plus a cbdc well
uh china's cbdc will be coming out very

2172
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:43,440
uh china's cbdc will be coming out very
 

2173
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,589
uh china's cbdc will be coming out very
soon will be less than maybe one or two

2174
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:45,599
soon will be less than maybe one or two
 

2175
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,550

if my information is correct um
 

2179
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,829
if my information is correct um
i think another trend pushing this

2180
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:51,839
i think another trend pushing this
 

2181
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:52,950
i think another trend pushing this
faster is

2182
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:52,960
faster is
 

2183
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,870
faster is
this early stage of institutional now
