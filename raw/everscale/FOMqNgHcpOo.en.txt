[Music]
yes
[Music]
foreign
[Laughter]
is
um
[Music]
something like that
[Music]
hello
[Music]
hello
nice do you hear me
yes yes
yeah we can
i
ready
okay do you hear me now
okay very good
there was some issue zoom for some
reason didn't see my mic
uh all right guys so welcome at our 48th
uh weekly defy governance call
so we have
a very interesting agenda for today and
then a guest
a special guest who will tell us about a
very interesting topic about the
compliance in the divide sector
uh
so we will come to this in a while and i
will present our guest
but let's traditionally begin from the
contest update
uh so actually we have finally finally
from the third attempt we have finished
the st town contest and uh we finally
got a quorum and
now it's time for calculation of votes
uh but
so far as i can see is a threshold has
passed
i can finally congratulate anton
with a william first and and single
plays uh in this contest uh and i also
together with other governance members
planned the call we serve with him to
discuss the future development of the
stone concept
and
also
some
other participants of the device of
governance also already took a step
ahead and
as far as i can see started integration
of this concept but i will keep this for
a while so they will tell it themselves
so
actually this leads us to the
discussion of the payment
session planning uh hopefully we will do
this early next week
uh probably monday or tuesday so we will
discuss this with our payment group and
we'll arrange the payment
uh and
after the call with uh with anton so we
will decide
on
uh
if we need uh additional iteration of
the contest uh for the
uh implementation integration stage for
example uh or this is fine by now and
he will do it this is
uh so speaking about other contests uh
actually the validator oracle contest
has passed into the voting stage and
so please if you're a juror in this
contest uh
do not hesitate to go there and check uh
one actually one submission so i really
hope that it will be a bit more uh
taken into account that we prolonged it
several times
uh
yeah so
please please do
uh speaking about other contests so we
have uh have the decks uh stage three uh
underway so we are still 11 days left
for for the submissions and uh also uh
the ethereum bridge uh but i can already
tell now that uh unfortunately uh
brooks's team
is extremely occupied now with the
deployment of the second version of the
bridge in the main net
and uh
so we are not able to prepare as a
submission now so and
most probably will not be able to
dedicate some time to this in the coming
two weeks because we will be performing
a lot of checks and to make sure that
everything works fine on the main net
and we will get back to this topic maybe
in the next meeting or a meeting after
uh and also the uh free tons of
sovereign identity framework stage two
uh still underway so there are 22 days
left
so not nothing to to tell about this for
now
uh now let's come to the topic uh with
our invited guest so please welcome
sasha anthropov who is the co-founder of
the purify
startup so and a very good
background track in different ml systems
including ml both asia finance casper
labs
so yeah please sasha
hey guys hey everyone hi vlad thanks uh
thanks for the intro
um
glad to be here and uh saying hi
to everyone in
on the call i already see some of the
familiar faces here
um so glad to be here uh
yeah so beautify is a startup is our
latest
essentially is our latest
uh development um
trying to solve
um a growing or or a growing problem
that we see in device space
originally this project came to life as
a result of our work
at aml book
so my partners are the founders of ml
bot and
health safe
and
essentially we started receiving over
the last
i don't know year or two we started
receiving a lot of
inquiries from
just people
investors and retail retail investors
that
somehow they utilized d5 for the sexy
returns and they went on centralized
exchange and their account was blocked
because like the ml risk was high
so those people were coming to mlbot and
asking questions what they could do to
unlock unblock it and we started
realizing with the growing narrative
from odin from all the regulators around
the world that
the focus
right now
is really on defy we started digging
into
the problem and we
looks like we found the core of that
problem
and
started working on a solution to help
conscious defy investors participants
projects and institutional investors to
be able to interact with defy market
with uh defy
services or or instruments
and
mitigate risks
um that
there are there are already associated
with some of the projects with coins
that have
high ml rescore
as as scary and harsh as this could
sound defy compliance and aml all
together in one sentence
um
being at a certain extent as a crypto
anarchist and at heart but being a
realist in life
we we
we understand that
the reality is that all the financial
institutions
regulators stratify uh organizations
won't really happen
won't allow the d5 sector to grow
substantially unless there are certain
understandable
procedures in place
and i'm referring to aml
uh i wouldn't touch the topic of kyc
because that's like that's a sensitive
topic as well for especially for d5
space
but i'd rather focus on aml and the you
know the the necessity of that in order
to
have
two industries like the alternative
finance which
we love and which is what defy is in
reality
and the traditional finance or legacy
finance
to actually merge and
in my opinion or in an opinion of our
team
the only way for real mass adoption to
happen
is to enable
um
traditional finance boys large
organizations from
legacy financial systems to actually
interact with
d5
but safely
and uh once this happens then we can you
know we can actually start saying that
you know the actual the real mass
adoption
is on the way
so that's uh on a very
high level overview of what is the
what are we working on and what is the
long goal like long mission
and goal that we're working on
um
[Music]
without without i don't i don't like you
know shameless self promotion
uh it's more of a it's more of a idea to
discuss the problem that is you know
that exists and that is
that shows it's
actually growing substantially every
month
and and it is more of a you know sharing
our experience
and uh you know overview
of what's been going on within the aml
space and d5 and generally within the
regulators
and
giving some of the examples of how the
narrative from
core participants of this space without
naming the actual companies or players
but like
uh i guess you will all probably
understand who i'm talking about like
one of the biggest like is a good
example of how important this problem is
right now for large organizations in d5
um
one story so six or seven months ago
when we were just working on a concept
forming the concept of purify we were
discussing with
um with a few strategic entities who we
wanted to see as potentially investors
or partners
and again without naming names those
were uh like the biggest
um
dexes
uh i would say like an aggregator and i
i believe you you'll connect the dots
um
and so we were discussing with them
about the partnership and back then they
were like
saying oh no hell no we don't need that
what is like why would we need
compliance why would we need aml
we don't really care there is no like
regulator is not gonna come and even if
they do we're not an entity we're just a
bunch of smart contracts they can't do
anything
so then
fast forward six months later
now we are discussing with them about
actual
collaboration and integrating our
products
that are currently being developed
but integrating our product
for its core purpose
enabling
enabling those organizations to actually
filter
incoming uh liquidity
or incoming assets with high with high
ml risk score and more to that like
so the narrative within the last six
months changed dramatically
and we already seen in parallel we
already see the companies like
ava and compound are already launching
institutional grade liquidity pools with
ml kyc
and custody solutions
and that is together with the actual
situation like
you know on the ground
we see that this is already a growing
and like a growing trend
that
for
coming month there's more and more
uh dexes
bridges liquidity pool operators landing
borrowing protocols
everyone's starting to think about the
need to kind of you know
make sure that
the assets that are actually being you
know stolen
or some you know illicit funds
associated with dark web they're
actually not participating in their
pools
sorry uh do you think that um
we are coming to a moment when uh
popular liquidity uh
pools will be separated into two big
chunks so the one uh
pure and innocent i would say
for big companies uh to interact with
this uh
uh
a huge market and other is for crypto
anarchists or
civil punks who
doesn't care about the quality of the
crypto but uh
they value the privacy and um
they how to put it
and security of the funds more
so uh and wouldn't that uh harm the
overall business of those defy operators
uh that's a very good question and i
think this is a spot on the train like
what's really happening lately
um
what we see and what we feel and all of
our investors and the people who speak
from the institutional background
like you know hedge fund operators
pension fund operators people
the people and entities that have
hundreds of billions and trillions under
management
people who have nothing to do with
crypto except there probably have some
exposure
in you know on a personal capacity
and
everyone agrees that there will be a
very
clear distinction from
entities in the d5 space who
will take on the new regulation that is
coming who will comply and who won't
and looks like for companies in order to
reach high tbl and in order to onboard
institutional
assets or funds
they will have to
kind of do not de-anonymize their
wallets
they will have to comply in a certain
way and check the ml risks
for their investors and for the projects
who won't just basically will will
remain you know will remain in the
underground
and i'm not saying this is bad
this is good for both sides in my
opinion like the more
regulators come in and start saying you
know you have to comply and this and
that start creating like the real really
strict
rules or at least try to create those
strict rules the more technology
um
for anonymous uh coins
you know mixers
all of that stuff will evolve even
further
um
so
i don't think it will be a bad thing i
think it's inevitable and we'll just
have to work around it
okay thank you and um another question i
really have in my mind is about
what a typical
vectors of attack by government agencies
will be on the default operators so
because as you say
they are just a combination of smart
contracts and at maximum they provide
some front ends to those smart contracts
and even if a company that stays behind
the front end will disappear or be
blocked in certain uh regulations
uh
it will not stop uh those smart
contracts from existence so actually and
anyone for example can uh deploy a copy
of
uni swap or social swap interface and
interact with those smart contracts
still
so uh how how do you think
governments will
try to approach this uh this
problematics
you mean govern governments
yeah regulate regulators so yeah so
those who uh try to impose certain um
aml rules yeah
that's
that's a good question um i don't know
if i have uh
you know
the correct answer
uh but my thinking is that you know we
already see
how
uh
certain agencies from us
started to block
certain wallets of certain d5 projects
i honestly
not sure
how that would
you know stop
uh
you know the same companies or doing you
know similar similar activities
because essentially i mean they
they take the ownership of the private
keys or where they they block the work
they sorry they block operation of
of those projects by confiscating the
private keys which is which sounds like
like i don't know
it's
actually
doesn't sound doesn't sound right yeah
and secondly like
well the anonymizing of wallets is
already happening
i mean
take take take into account
you know that the that chain analysis
is only worth
a few billion of dollars uh because of
the governmental contracts
yeah absolutely and there and there's
and their system is actually very
sophisticated
we we tested till uh we tested uh i
cannot well i'm not gonna name again the
companies because i don't want to create
any
issues for us in the future
we we basically work with aml service
providers and utilize their tech
and we can
in real time we screen the wallets and
transactions
and we compare different aml service
providers
and what the result is
we see that
um tier one or the major i would say
three four five ml service providers
um
again i don't want to publicly you know
say the names because that would create
certain
um
negativity potentially but anyway
um they look they don't like to be
compared none of them but we compare
them and we see that
one service provider
and their result is absolutely like
completely different from another so
there is no
um i would say there is no
um benchmark probably exactly yeah there
is no benchmark there is no
black or black or white yet there is no
rule of thumb
we see that
uh an organization
uh one of the largest organizations just
screens all all the addresses that
participate with
d5
in the defy space again like if you
participate with a uni swap
your wallet will be automatically
flagged as as high risk
right now that's the reality
um
it's on everyone's agenda i mean among
all the regulators right fatf scc
um to find ways how to regulate uh defy
space but we but we from other angle we
see that ml service providers don't
don't don't understand what's going on
inside they see any transaction
you know with
with associated
funds from one of the you know from one
of the exploits
um they see they see it as normal but in
the same time if you if you interacted
with with you know any decks you will be
flagged
and yeah
and that's by the way is a really
interesting problematic because because
um
on one hand yes
we all know that frosters attempt to
launder the money through taxes and
some other services or disease and so on
so forth but on the other hand there are
uh if i have some uh some crypto that
they uh absolutely legally purchased
and uh i would like to purchase another
crypto for it uh that is listed only on
decks so
and for a small portion of my funds so
and
creating uh the strong link between me
and high risk is absolutely
uh incorrect just because the regulators
do not want to
dig deeper and try to understand what's
going on inside and um on the other hand
uh the axes are
time to time used as a big mixers
that's true and
that's a raising issue in the world and
i don't really think that anyone can
block them yeah because
the only way to block all this smart
contracts execution is uh just by
stopping the network so
this is the only reliable
way to do this but you cannot stall for
example ethereum
because there are so many nodes that
support its work
so
that means that uh aml services for for
d5 products um
are more like a reputational uh step
that uh uh shows to
a big
investment guys that it's safe
to interact with this with this device
service and this means that uh in the
coming future
in my opinion we will see the situation
when uh
those ml scanning services blockchain
analysis services
will have to uh significantly improve
the analysis methods yeah exactly just
to understand that there are no more
just a single deck but there may be
different different liquidity pools with
a different quality of crypto inside
uh and yeah just so complicated they
work of course
yeah i totally agree vlad and i before
before you ended up by saying that ml
analytics should improve
which is i agree 100
you said something uh that i wanted to
comment on in the beginning that
um when you interact with the dex
um
regulators will treat you like
you know like a high risk um
entity or or you know a person
but is essentially regulators are
counting on analytics data taken from
aml service providers and a ml service
providers don't know about how to
regulate
uh how to analyze transactions
absolutely within within d5 i'm not
talking about like
analyzing the
transactions that
are happening inside the decks
which is doable but which is but but
very complicated
but also like
for them what is really rocket science
is is trying to
um
[Music]
trying to create this trying to create a
system that will
essentially
unfold what's really going on inside the
mixers
there are ways how
you know you can kind of like
associate certain transaction
when it goes in and out
there is no hundred percent and for them
this is kind of like they have to go in
i don't know
tens of thousands light years away in
terms of technical development to
understand that because right now a
single a simple transaction can be
um
you know
viewed or labeled as high risk for no
reason
so there is like
we realized that when we started working
with you know different ml service
providers different databases
and we realized like you know if we were
really to
build up a system that would
uh really help
um
individual investors or or organizations
to say hey actual our risk score is not
10 or is not like 80 percent
uh we're actually we have the mlk oscs
and stuff so we hope that
the system that we're that we that we're
building
will also enable
the reverse engineer uh that's risk
score for the entities who want to
implement that and go talk to a ml
service provider and say hey this is
actually not a risk like high risk
transaction
and for them again like aml is one thing
which is which is what which is what is
important at this
like
right now
but further down the road there also
have to be
i i expect uh
i don't like it but i expect that the
kyc will have to be in place as well
and that's a whole different ballpark
kyc and uh
i like it only because
we we will essentially come from web 2.3
to
2.0 to 3.0
and uh self-sovereign identity and did
systems
uh and kyc have to be in place and i
know stephan here is already kind of
like yeah yeah not only but also
vladimir putin
is ready
yeah i have a quick requirement here
i just watched the conference yesterday
and right inside in the stream site
uh which is public but i guess someone
uh maybe didn't care about it so it's
not just us who are thinking about it
it's actually uh some of the bigger
players do as well so i i have a friend
who was like one of the initial founders
of some ssi companies like four or five
years back and she was working at mit
she built this company with educational
credentials and recently i think
one or two weeks ago she joined the
company or organization that is called
center
and that is organization founded by
circle creator of usdc and coinbase
and that's exactly the single
focus of that organization is i i guess
it will be nonprofit but they building a
product that will use a sovereign
identity in order to create uh
portable provable kyc aml uh payment uh
confirmation just all type of document
that will basically merge these two
words so uh
based if you again if if you follow the
us recently they have this little bit of
tension this is this as you see um
[Music]
with the center
um
i'm i'm gonna have to call this her
tomorrow
i'm not involved but uh they just
started it's like
probably was announced or it was it went
public last week um
but i think uh what they're trying to do
they're trying to show that
cryptocurrency payments can be
as
transparent and
easy to understand for regulators as
banking payments
except it's
cheaper faster more convenient
uh less friction for the customers so
and that
i totally agree with your uh what you
said in the beginning that's that would
lead to massive option so when
regulators understand that it's fine and
when people understand that it is fine
and it's actually better faster and
simpler and more convenient then we will
have everybody
i have one more point uh going back to
what vlad vlad was saying so also
not probably not many people
yet think about it or understand but
so if you think on the big guys in d5
space like top 5 top 10 projects in with
tbl
of the compound
along some you know along those names
their biggest investors are already
institutional
entities
but right now
they just participate in you know in
their lending protocol by you know
generating for 15
13 15 or 16
apy and for them this is amazing but
again um
if you only part if you only um if you
only
participate in those liquidity pools
this is one thing
because the kind of
like they kind of control who's who's
getting in or who's not but like if you
want to go and you know and start uh
dig deeper if you're going digit
then you know there's like all the money
that you will that you will generate
there
there is a high pers there is high
chance that it will be questioned or it
will be blocked
and this is and this is a role
a roadblock for a lot of
smaller or bigger institutional
investors to coming in
um
uh into the space
uh right now they're already participate
so my point is that they're already
participating in the biggest protocols
with with
you know
managing the risks on their own
and only when ave and compound started
getting in aml and kyc and custody in
place this is when it opened up the
doors for
a lot of inflow of
liquidity
yeah so there's a moment when you are
big enough to
when you have to think about such kind
of issues
uh yes thank you so much sasha uh so um
what are your common plans in terms of
your purify product so uh do you plan to
start from the ethereum and maybe layer
two solutions first of all or maybe you
are planning also to route it to some
other
networks like polkadot or solana or
friton
tell us about
look
right now we are in the process of
[Music]
we are building a product which should
be live in the next
i would say four weeks
and that will be a web uh sdk like
front-end sdk
that could be connected with
uh d5 protocols
but
uh and will be connected connected with
our dashboard as well
that will enable
dexes or or d5 projects
to screen um the incoming liquidity
it will be the
the filtering of high risk liquidity
will only in the first iteration will be
realized through
front end like if you get a high risk
then literally the button that says sign
the transaction won't work
and it will it will require a very
simple
front-end sdk integration
and we will do the rest
um
that's that right now i'm personally
with my team i'm working on customer
development with a number of entities to
make sure that the product we're
actually thinking that is needed on the
market is actually needed
so
that's that um in the meantime
in the meantime
we are working on a service offering
that we offer to
pre-idol projects and pre-id and ideal
platforms
uh for the projects to start from the
beginning
before they raise funds to uh
be conscious about the ml risk of the
money that they're you know receiving in
the private rounds
um
so we're working manually we're working
with
with a number of projects
talking about
layer one or layer two
uh for us
the next
probably next week
or two will be integrate
we'll be launching
we'll be releasing news about polygon
so we're really we're working with matic
uh quite closely and uh we'll be
integrating
um creating a pair in one of the dexes
there
and some partnerships as well those will
be announced very very soon
um
when you ask about layer ones
so right now we are we are on um if and
bsc but we are in talks with uh with i
mean we already partnered with casper
labs
um well it was the lowest hanging fruit
obviously
but
we will be utilizing their
infrastructure to store
some part of our
data
non-sensitive data there
in their public permission environment
we are in talks with pretty much
all the major player ones
um and our our
product and our business is
by providing
the aml analytics
for projects and and retail users so the
more layer ones we will connect the
better for the entire ecosystem
and therefore quickly answering your
question we are in talks with solana
we're in talks with cava
conflux with you guys
um
with the polka
so the pipeline of integrations is quite
uh big it's just the bandwidth of our
technical team is is obviously limited
like with with every startup but yeah
further down the road i hope that our
our project will be featured on
uh as many layer ones as possible
the problem here though
and this is something that not yet many
people understand
the problem is that even if we um
integrate on a layer one
which is
not if or bsc or or bitcoin for example
um
we won't be automatically able to
perform ml screening on chain ml screens
because
as
as we discussed with you previously but
it's worth saying you know to to the
rest of the participants that
before
uh any ml um screening can happen on
chain
uh the the network itself has to go
through
kind of like a heavy
uh
heavy duty work of
clustering and indexing their entire
chain
and this is something goes you know this
is something you know boring and
technical but there should be for any
change there should be
uh
there's
there should be certain steps before we
can actually work with them and this is
something that we're offering as well to
some of our you know layer one
uh interested layer ones
uh that are that like what we do that
they realize that the pro the project
the problem sorry the problem is there
they realize that it's relevant
but
uh they can't really do anything about
it so we're offering them part of the
integration we're offering them to take
on
this task which is quite complicated and
requires grants etc but
this is uh there is this is how we form
partnerships essentially long-term
engagements and partnerships
okay thank you thank you very much
so guys we do have some some other
questions before we move on
three two one no questions no question
good so thank you sasha for attending
here so it was really uh pleasant and
interesting discussion so i hope that it
will be not the last one so when we will
continue discussing such interesting
topics
uh so and now uh yeah we we switch to
next topic on our agenda
uh so uh as you know uh there is a
multi-conference coming on and
alexander
this morning just pinged me and asked if
we are going to send someone there so uh
alex please so say a few words about
this
thank you
[Music]
as you know remember
we participated in
ibc
sigma
conference in dubai in may
it was
pretty good and thankful
and
now the next step uh we will have from
16 up to 18 of november this year
the same conference on malta
and
freetown sponsor and
we have some free plays for
our members and in this
time
freeton decided to do it a little bit in
our way before we did one contest for
all free tone blockchain
and everybody who want to participate
do the submission
now
we decide to
change and every sub-governments
will
present their
participants
the maximum um
free tone weighed
five person from
every sub governance
and
compensate this five percent
with three thousand ton crystal for each
from them
for
this conference
um but it's um doesn't mean then uh if
for example we decide that we need more
participants from our
sub governance
or we need to pay more for them we can
decide it
inside of our garments
or we discuss or do some proposal
and um
um
purpose uh to uh present uh our
sub governance present our project
uh what's this uh device of governments
and free tone what's this uh defy uh
allianz
uh tone bridge
uh
what
projects
will be finished now what we wait taxes
uh what our nearest future
and um
return wait that we
finished with uh this
contents or how we do it uh
in
up to first of october
maybe this is uh term will be prolonged
but they ask
can you finish uh to this term
and um
for example uh
um some another sub governments decide
to do contests and some
participants can
[Music]
put their submission
and explain why
they
the better
member for this conference
we can do in the same way or discuss uh
maybe in another way maybe
more easy or more suitable for
defy
because
we have not only some governance uh we
have a little bit more
for example we need to talk about tom
swapp um
and we need
some representative from
defile yards
and one
before we start to discuss and maybe now
or later one big question
that um we have a special
rules about code
i think maybe it's better if i share
screen a little bit
uh
yeah the place i gave the permission
okay
because
this is information
from
mult
organizator from
sigma
and um here some
scheme
um how um
members
participant and conference
what they need to do about covet rules
and uh
here two zones red zone in dark red zone
for starting to explain
uh
russia for example and dark red zone
most of
europe
or maybe all europe in red zone
for example uh serbia in red zone
belarus in red zone
but russian and dark red zone if you are
in red zone you need to
go by left part here
and
if you spend before 40 days in red zone
you live in i don't know
in europe or was in belarus for example
for 14 days before
and you can prove it uh and you fall
vaccinated it means you don't have uh
much problem uh you only must to show
your documents about vaccine and and
this is what's in but that
recognized from public health
organization unfortunately sputnik 5 not
in this list
uh but maybe something changed for now
uh even if you and red zone but not
fully vaccinated uh you will go uh for
another um
in this came another way and
unfortunately you must have 40 days
guaranteed maybe for most of personally
not suitable he one most big problem in
dark red zone i mean from russia for
example
uh
you will
have 40 days currently okay okay you
must to have some better etc but
14 days current time
um
i send a link
to this
form to this scam
and so you can look more gently
it's mean that um
maybe
in some reason uh we
must to have not five person uh in list
for
this traveling maybe more and uh if
someone cannot to travel because
had called or
not
vaccinated fully vaccinated before 14
days before two weeks uh before
conference it's important uh one
[Music]
important thing
uh in this case if somebody can
not travel uh in a for example in our
list
10 person
uh
we start to choose in our person who
will travel this is one idea how to do
um
for more
um suitable way more
and uh
well maybe it's pretty well about this
samantha conference
uh
maybe somebody have comments or
ideas how to do better
yeah it's quite a challenging task to
together
not only speaking about what to do there
yes
ask to change the place from the monster
to the i don't know yeah this was my
first proposal
i i think the the better way will be you
know to deliver there a big monitor or
several monitors with representatives of
the device of golf on the other side
and
anyone can come and ask any questions so
it will be much more productive than to
to stay 14 days in the quarantine and
[Music]
yeah
so
this is not
something that's really is fascinating
uh
i'm in this case surprised that um
sigma has chosen uh malted for running
this conference
and uh but okay so
i think the same rules will be in every
european community country
it's mean that
must choose if not why the not european
they should choose
serbia so serbia is a good place
especially
it's easy
uh every serbian person who lived 14
days before my conference can come
without
a
test
on without a vaccinated certificate
uh i also see the hand raised mid
replace so we have something
hello uh one simple question for alex uh
did you know something uh for turkish uh
people if uh somebody in turkey uh for
14 days or
longer bit
today
if we look on this page i send it
already links to
our chat here chat i mean
zoom chat
here in the
list of red country zone
and if you go on
turkish turkish in red zone yes not in
dark red zone
in dark red zones some
countries like barbados bolivia and
russia it's uh
i don't know
i don't have answers from some politics
i think not more
yeah okay i think it's i think it's
about the
legacy of the communists
yeah
okay okay okay so um uh but frankly
speaking so uh before we uh even think
about who can go there and uh if they
permitted to go there so um
i propose to think about so what are our
objectives as the defy uh sub-governance
of this conference
and uh what we would like to set as
objectives for ourselves uh to deliver
uh as a result of this conference
because uh
last time we've got uh
several good contacts from the
conference but uh of course there is
always something to do better than it
was
uh so um
what i would propose is
for everyone to
send the ideas uh on what can be done
what we can achieve
um
it's multiconference and
what kind of products or we would like
to promote what kind of
kind of projects we would like to hire
for freetown and invite them to build
these solutions here so uh in my opinion
uh we have uh the defy roadmap that and
we have some some
missing
bricks in it so and like uh the credit
protocol like uh
the oracles well maybe oracles will be
fixed but like the stable coins or and
some other higher level solutions uh and
the conference may be a good way to find
those teams who would like to join us
and help us build
those solutions natively on free tom
uh if you have some other thoughts so
please please express and uh
just maybe share the your thoughts in
the in public in the defy group
i agree with the teens and maybe the
best idea what we
need from this conference next big idea
um for example beef phone conference
clip on zoro we had some interesting
meeting with
team from defy
projects uh
when we can have connection with them
and even
listed uh tom crystal talking or
uh or more and more and uh how i know on
this conference they will be
the next time
and
because now our connections in some way
uh maybe it's i am
stopped in stop way yes we try to
discuss but uh wait one month maybe it's
better to meet them uh on conference and
speak maybe drink something can speak
like more in friendly situations yeah
absolutely to
get the informal connections
as i like this name
okay
yeah absolutely
uh okay guys so uh we have just one
more topic
left so and seven minutes to talk so
anzor would like to
propose some something for our jurors
and tell some updates
yeah hello everyone uh hello again um i
won't take much of your time it's just
uh
um in in other sub governance uh in nfts
of governance there's been uh a content
a contest recently uh and it's a quiet
well an important and complex topic
this contest was dedicated to the
ethereum
friton nft bridge
and
or more specifically to it to the
architecture and uh
design
part of this
solution so there's been two two
submissions there
which are
well let's say they're suboptimal
and
yeah it's really
it's really hard to tell that from the
jurors
votes on those submissions but if you
dive deeper
it will be quite obvious that
well
there is um
a ready product cannot be made from this
so
you you can't proceed with this
architecture and uh
of course it's a it's a complex topic
it's a it's a technical uh
it's there's a lot of technical stuff
not rocket science but i mean not rocket
science at least for
for uh
for people who are experienced
with defy nft and blockchain but still
so the proposal
is to or rather maybe
a topic for discussion is to
ask
jurors from other sub-governances such
as for more technical sub-governance
sub-currencies like developer experience
and
defy to participate in voting for
nft contests
because
well it's as complex as defy in terms of
technical stuff
and uh experience from of the dividers
is very needed in in nft sub governance
for it to go forward
um and
yeah
i think it will be
i'm not sure how to organize this though
i i'm open to
to to discussion for this for this but i
think this is a very simple and
effective uh
solution to to help the nft sub
governance move forward and produce some
well good results in terms of products
and
well even designs at this at this stage
yeah actually um i have the answer to to
you on this so uh i just dropped the
link so we actually if you remember have
adopted the
specific uh regulation on external
jurors involvement for the deficit
governance itself because uh
we still miss
smart contract experts and for certain
contests where we would like to attract
them so we agreed with the devex subgolf
to
include specifically the jurors for
certain contests
and uh however the initial uh memorandum
of of the deficit governance didn't
suppose this so we explicitly pro
adopted the
uh
the regulation on this so uh what i
would propose you in terms of the infts
of golf is to
uh
just maybe copy this document and just
change few words uh and uh the only
things on a procedural standpoint that
you will need to to tackle is first of
all uh to explicitly specify the list of
uh the jurors you would like to invite
to the contest and
if i remember it well so there is a
certain limitation on the number of
jurors for for contests it's it's not
very big uh so it sounds like
or maybe 32 or a bit more but maybe they
have changed something in terms of a
smart contract and second is that for
each contest where you are using uh the
non-standard jury so you need to ping
the
interface team for them to deploy the
correct set of jurors uh and on the
other side yeah it's uh
absolutely simple procedure
uh in terms of the nft breach uh it was
really
well a surprise for me because we
actually have the function in ethereum
bridge that can be easily expanded
to support nfts as well so i have
already told this already to alex that
the bridge is built in such a way that
the only thing you need to do is just to
write the adapter for for the specific
type of content for ethereum site and
for the freetown site and deploy this
set of contracts uh with a new version
that is currently being deployed by uh
by brock's team
you will have the opportunity to run
this proposal through the dow system
already and uh so we hope that we will
manage to get the interfaces done
within uh coming two weeks uh
well no promises but if there will be no
interfaces it still can be done just
through the
tonus
calls so it's it's not that complex so
of course we will provide with all the
resolve the instructions
uh yeah and uh
i'm saying this not to promote brox's
bridge
but just to say that
each bridge between two
networks uh is a very very complicated
system that
and you need to take care of such hell
amount of uh
peculiarities that uh
you will not be able to do this
without having specific experts and
security experts on your site
because we have run uh
already three or four audits security
audits of our solution to get the uh
uh
well
the level of security that we consider
sufficient yeah still there are some
minor bugs of course that will be fixed
in the coming releases but they cannot
lead to the stealing of funds or assets
or interrupting the
work of the bridge
but to do this so we had to really
invest
the efforts of
more than 10 people for over the course
of uh six months so you can imagine the
level of complexity of this stuff so
that's why uh
i personally think that the easiest way
to build the nft bridge is to just make
the expansion for the existent on bridge
io that will let you to uh to transfer a
certain type of content and then you can
easily land all these nfts wherever you
like
uh yeah we'll discuss this also in
person with alex next week uh just to
get to dig into the details and um
for better understand so how how this
can
this should work actually
yeah and you had some uh some other
update as well yeah i just wanted to add
that uh that we we know about um we know
about security because because it's it's
really like a very very complex topic uh
regarding the taxes then the bridges we
as we started well the auditing process
for our dax it's become apparent that
there is lots of stuff stuff absolutely
you know what i mean
yeah yeah yeah
um so um
uh yeah i i had another announcement
just a short one uh about the it's gonna
it's related to st town contest so uh at
our uh devi space uh platform uh which
is like the evolution of of the
uh uh decentralized exchange that we
developed for the contests we
implemented staking certificates
supporting through nft
so that uh users that stake free tone
well tone crystals
can
leverage this to to get liquidity
even if their stake is locked for a
certain amount of time
so they can
they can
this is why we're so obsessed with the
nft bridge as well because
because
uh it will allow to transfer liquidity
from free ton even further even if your
stake is locked for like 12 months or 48
months or whatever any kind of nft token
yeah yes yes yes so you can you can send
it
you can uh you can sell it you can use
it as uh as the uh
well um
you know
as a collateral yeah as a collateral so
it's uh yeah it's really cool i'm not
gonna
spend too much time now to to talk about
it but just a short announcement we'll
present it later yeah yeah please if you
have some presentation uh
or maybe some explanatory video so it
will really be nice to see it please
just drop it maybe either to the defy
group or maybe we can just schedule some
time for you next time to explain more
in details yeah cool thank you
okay very good uh so actually we are run
out of time so no no more time for
discussing certain topics for today so
um
i really want to thank you everyone for
coming so it was really interesting and
pleasant discussions this time
as usual of course
so i wish you everyone a nice weekend
and see you next week
bye-bye
all right thank you
