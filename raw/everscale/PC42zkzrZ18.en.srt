we are not instead of talking about what
 

135
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,070
we are not instead of talking about what
we actually are

136
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
we actually are
 

137
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,149
we actually are
so the most important part is that we

138
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
so the most important part is that we
 

139
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,550
so the most important part is that we
are actually not a web-free project so

140
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
are actually not a web-free project so
 

141
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,550
are actually not a web-free project so
we are we're not focused on crypto and

142
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
we are we're not focused on crypto and
 

143
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,270
we are we're not focused on crypto and
we are not crypto experts ourselves so

144
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
we are not crypto experts ourselves so
 

145
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,670
we are not crypto experts ourselves so
we come from ai background and we did

146
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
we come from ai background and we did
 

147
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,149
we come from ai background and we did
like acid tone of air research of

148
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
like acid tone of air research of
 

149
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,750
like acid tone of air research of

for data scientists so for people who

168
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
for data scientists so for people who
 

169
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,789
for data scientists so for people who
like trains those neural networks which

170
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
like trains those neural networks which
 

171
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,270
like trains those neural networks which
then i don't know apply masks for to use

172

blockchain
and now we're working on the next one

1634
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:44,720
and now we're working on the next one
 

1635
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,789
and now we're working on the next one
which is more exciting one it's called

1636
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:46,799
which is more exciting one it's called
 

1637
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,590
which is more exciting one it's called
ddc integration and basically the ddc

1638
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:49,600
ddc integration and basically the ddc
 

1639
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,710
ddc integration and basically the ddc
stands for the decentralized uh digital

1640
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:52,720
stands for the decentralized uh digital
 

1641
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,310
stands for the decentralized uh digital
uh sorry this decentralized digital

1642
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:54,320
uh sorry this decentralized digital
 

1643
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,470
uh sorry this decentralized digital
certificate which is basically just the

1644
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:56,480
certificate which is basically just the
 

1645
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,710
certificate which is basically just the
equivalent of nft

1646
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:58,720
equivalent of nft
 

1647
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,230
equivalent of nft
because the nft is

1648
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:00,240
because the nft is
 

1649
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,870
because the nft is
a kind of a little bit sensitive in back

1650
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:02,880
a kind of a little bit sensitive in back
 

1651
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,909
a kind of a little bit sensitive in back
in china so that's why bsn they adopted

1652
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:05,919
in china so that's why bsn they adopted
 

1653
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,389
in china so that's why bsn they adopted
a new terminology called ddc

1654
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:08,399
a new terminology called ddc
 

1655
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,829
a new terminology called ddc
and now

1656
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:09,839
and now
 

1657
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,149
and now
thanks to the new standard which is the

1658
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:12,159
thanks to the new standard which is the
 

1659
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,310
thanks to the new standard which is the
tip four and now we we have an

1660
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,320
tip four and now we we have an
 

1661
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,829
tip four and now we we have an
equivalent of erc 721 on every scale so

1662
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:17,839
equivalent of erc 721 on every scale so
 

1663
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,389
equivalent of erc 721 on every scale so
that's right now our team is working

1664
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:20,399
that's right now our team is working
 

1665
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,710
that's right now our team is working
very hard on integrating

1666
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,720
very hard on integrating
 

1667
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,190
very hard on integrating
this tip in 4.1

00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,200
this tip in 4.1
 

1669
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,829
this tip in 4.1
with the current ddc

1670
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:27,839
with the current ddc
 

1671
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,349
with the current ddc
specification

1672

00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:37,760
and other teams on every scale community
 

1679
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,589
and other teams on every scale community
and now hopefully i think we can get

1680
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:39,599
and now hopefully i think we can get
 

1681
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,990
and now hopefully i think we can get
something ready next week

1682
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,000
something ready next week
 

1683
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,109
something ready next week
and

1684
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:43,119
and
 

1685
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,829
and
for the ddc and once this up and running

1686
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:45,839
for the ddc and once this up and running
 

1687
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,629
for the ddc and once this up and running
on bsn average scale network inside of

1688
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:48,639
on bsn average scale network inside of
 

1689
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,669
on bsn average scale network inside of
china

1690

china
 

1691
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,109
china
mainland then

mainland then
 

1693
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,230
mainland then
we we hopefully can get some real good

1694
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,240
we we hopefully can get some real good
 

1695
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,310
we we hopefully can get some real good
top brand like ip

1696

top brand like ip
 

1697
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,670
top brand like ip
and brands they can doing minting of rft

1698
00:34:59,670 --> 00:34:59,680
and brands they can doing minting of rft
 

1699
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,750
and brands they can doing minting of rft
or what we call the ddc

1700
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:01,760
or what we call the ddc
 

1701
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,990
or what we call the ddc
on bs and our scale network

1702
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:04,000
on bs and our scale network
 

1703
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,230
on bs and our scale network
and that would be a very important way

1704
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,240
and that would be a very important way
 

1705
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,349
