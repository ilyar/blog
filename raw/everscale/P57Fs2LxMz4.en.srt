the step that's which the proposal is
 

349
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,829
the step that's which the proposal is
now uh

350
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
now uh
 

351
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,470
now uh
staying so there are actually uh four

352
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
staying so there are actually uh four
 

353
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,110
staying so there are actually uh four
steps the first one is the pending when

354
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
steps the first one is the pending when
 

355
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,509
steps the first one is the pending when
the proposal is published and it stays

356
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:47,519
the proposal is published and it stays
 

357
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,870
the proposal is published and it stays
there for everyone to review

358
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:50,880
there for everyone to review
 

359
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,310
there for everyone to review
at this stage the proposer can uh cancel

360
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
at this stage the proposer can uh cancel
 

361
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,069
at this stage the proposer can uh cancel
it and

362
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
it and
 

363
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,949
it and
it it can be cancelled until it's uh

364
00:12:58,949 --> 00:12:58,959
it it can be cancelled until it's uh
 

365
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,310
it it can be cancelled until it's uh
queued so for all this period of time so

366
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
queued so for all this period of time so
 

367
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,110
queued so for all this period of time so
typically this stays as a two days

368
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
typically this stays as a two days
 

369
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,110
typically this stays as a two days
configuration but this can be changed

370
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,120
configuration but this can be changed
 

371
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,710
configuration but this can be changed
through the dow decision as well by the

372
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
through the dow decision as well by the
 

373
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,509
through the dow decision as well by the
way so every parameter here so like the

374
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
way so every parameter here so like the
 

375
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,590
way so every parameter here so like the
quorum parameter or

376
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
quorum parameter or
 

377
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,670
quorum parameter or
uh the duration of those steps can be

378
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,680
uh the duration of those steps can be
 

379
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,629
uh the duration of those steps can be
changed by by the dow decision

380
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
changed by by the dow decision
 

381
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,269
changed by by the dow decision
next it will uh be the voting period so

382
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
next it will uh be the voting period so
 

383
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,910
next it will uh be the voting period so
now it's it's configured to be three

384
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
now it's it's configured to be three
 

385
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,790
now it's it's configured to be three
days for voting but it can be reduced

386
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
days for voting but it can be reduced
 

387
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,790
days for voting but it can be reduced
uh then the lockup period to let uh

388
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
uh then the lockup period to let uh
 

389
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,509
uh then the lockup period to let uh
everyone uh if they are not agreeing

390
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:33,519
everyone uh if they are not agreeing
 

391
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,750
everyone uh if they are not agreeing
with this uh dow decision to take

392
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
with this uh dow decision to take
 

393
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,150
with this uh dow decision to take
actions and then it's the decisions

394
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
actions and then it's the decisions
 

395
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,509
actions and then it's the decisions
being executed

396
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,519
being executed
 

397
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,870
being executed
uh so uh here you see the current

398
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
uh so uh here you see the current
 

399
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,310
uh so uh here you see the current
distribution of the votings uh so you

400
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320
distribution of the votings uh so you
 

401
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,870
distribution of the votings uh so you
can vote not only for the proposal but

402
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:48,880
can vote not only for the proposal but
 

403
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,230
can vote not only for the proposal but
also against the proposal and uh

404
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,240
also against the proposal and uh
 

405
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,069
also against the proposal and uh
actually the

406
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
actually the
 

407
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,430
actually the
voting is pretty uh straightforward

408
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,440
voting is pretty uh straightforward
 

409
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,949
voting is pretty uh straightforward
so uh

410
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
so uh
 

411
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,030
so uh
it should reach the minimum quorum of

412
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,040
it should reach the minimum quorum of
 

413
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,069
it should reach the minimum quorum of
votes so meaning that at least

414
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
votes so meaning that at least
 

415
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,069
votes so meaning that at least
500 000 webers should participate in the

416
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
500 000 webers should participate in the
 

417
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,389
500 000 webers should participate in the
voting it's not only

418
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399
voting it's not only
 

419
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,269
voting it's not only
for but also uh in against

420
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:13,279
for but also uh in against
 

421
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,230
for but also uh in against
and uh you can vote for or against the

422
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,240
and uh you can vote for or against the
 

423
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,470
and uh you can vote for or against the
proposal as i said so yet if you the

424
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
proposal as i said so yet if you the
 

425
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,590
proposal as i said so yet if you the
proposal gets more votes uh then against

426
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:21,600
proposal gets more votes uh then against
 

427
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,509
proposal gets more votes uh then against
votes so it's the

428
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:23,519
votes so it's the
 

429
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,590
votes so it's the
considered accepted

430
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
considered accepted
 

431
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,710
considered accepted
um

432
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
um
 

433
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,750
um
here you will see the description uh

434
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:29,760
here you will see the description uh
 

435
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,829
here you will see the description uh
the description can be written in the

436
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:31,839
the description can be written in the
 

437
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,949
the description can be written in the
markdown and is stored directly in the

438
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
markdown and is stored directly in the
 

439
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,829
markdown and is stored directly in the
uh contract uh so there is a discussion

440
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
uh contract uh so there is a discussion
 

441
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,710
uh contract uh so there is a discussion
page so that can be uh configured to

442
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:40,720
page so that can be uh configured to
 

443
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,509
page so that can be uh configured to
anything uh so that you can put in the

444
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:43,519
anything uh so that you can put in the
 

445
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,110
anything uh so that you can put in the
field at the moment of the proposal

446
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
field at the moment of the proposal
 

447
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,150
field at the moment of the proposal
creation uh here are some uh everscale

448
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,160
creation uh here are some uh everscale
 

449
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,310
creation uh here are some uh everscale
actions so actually

450
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
actions so actually
 

451
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,350
actions so actually
the dao proposal can have actions inside

452
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:53,360
the dao proposal can have actions inside
 

453
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,710
the dao proposal can have actions inside
it that smart contract calls and

454
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:56,720
it that smart contract calls and
 

455
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,750
it that smart contract calls and
we will also write a guide on how to

456
00:14:59,750 --> 00:14:59,760
we will also write a guide on how to
 

457
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,310
we will also write a guide on how to
uh create those actions so it's not that

458
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,320
uh create those actions so it's not that
 

459
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,790
uh create those actions so it's not that
complex so actually what it contains is

460
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:04,800
complex so actually what it contains is
 

461
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,389
complex so actually what it contains is
a target smart contract to call and the

462
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:08,399
a target smart contract to call and the
 

463
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,949
a target smart contract to call and the
encoded payload uh to attach to this

464
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
encoded payload uh to attach to this
 

465
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,910
encoded payload uh to attach to this
smart contract call and also some

466
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
smart contract call and also some
 

467
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,350
smart contract call and also some
payload balance that you need to attach

468
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,360
payload balance that you need to attach
 

469
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,590
payload balance that you need to attach
when sending the message

470
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
when sending the message
 

471
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,470
when sending the message
and once the dao is accepted and at the

472
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
and once the dao is accepted and at the
 

473
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,550
and once the dao is accepted and at the
execution stage it will call this

474
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
execution stage it will call this
 

475
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,509
execution stage it will call this
specific contract uh with this payload

476
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
specific contract uh with this payload
 

477
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,990
specific contract uh with this payload
and the dash this amount so actually now

478
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
and the dash this amount so actually now
 

479
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,910
and the dash this amount so actually now
this contract if i remember it well it

480
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:33,920
this contract if i remember it well it
 

481
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,189
this contract if i remember it well it
is the

482
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
is the
 

483
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,069
is the
uh eho contract so and the encoded

484
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:38,079
uh eho contract so and the encoded
 

485
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,670
uh eho contract so and the encoded
payload say it's sounds like hello

486
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:41,680
payload say it's sounds like hello
 

487
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,710
payload say it's sounds like hello
so when you send it to it just send it

488
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
so when you send it to it just send it
 

489
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,749
so when you send it to it just send it
back

490
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:45,759
back
 

491
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,509
back
uh here you'll see the address of the

492
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
uh here you'll see the address of the
 

493
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,550
uh here you'll see the address of the
proposal uh the voting start date the

494
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
proposal uh the voting start date the
 

495
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,710
proposal uh the voting start date the
voting end date and

496
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:52,720
voting end date and
 

497
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,949
voting end date and
the period of course

498
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:54,959
the period of course
 

499
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,030
the period of course
once anyone votes uh for or against the

500
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,040
once anyone votes uh for or against the
 

501
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,790
once anyone votes uh for or against the
proposal so uh his vote will appear here

502
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800

 

503
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,030

he can provide some comment why he's

504
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
he can provide some comment why he's
 

505
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,749
he can provide some comment why he's
deciding this or that

506
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
deciding this or that
 

507
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,150
deciding this or that
and also what is important that for the

508
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160
and also what is important that for the
 

509
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,749
and also what is important that for the
duration of

the
 

513
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,350
the
voting period the your stake will be

514
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,360
