hi alex
let's wait for a katarina
oh i guess that's it oh oh oh you're
here

let me put that on mute
okay
so i'm not sure if anybody else is going
to join i've got all the speakers
no pavel that's purple
oh broxy a lot like it
thanks
what's that guy's name what's the name

sorry
what's the name of that nft
uh it doesn't have a name yet

 formativo
sensai madio
okay
just one more minute for paul and if not
then katarina you can go first
hi dave good afternoon oh we got pavel
so should i start or
pebbles here so good hey
cool
okay
number what are we
high up there
so summer holidays are finally coming to
a close and projects are gearing back up
there are discussions of road maps and
final stages new projects uh spartacats
is venturing forth into the mariana
trench have you seen that i don't know
what's up with that maybe we'll hear it
next time
and rump is getting ready for release
which is exciting so it's just another
reason why everscale has a perfect
technology for people who want to build
decentralized products and not hinder
their users experience
and there is a new channel in telegram
called everscale highlights which are
quick updates on what's going on in the
ecosystem
there's also an analytics channel called
everscale insights
uh so for those who are interested in
various types of data go check that out
and now i hope you've got a cup of
coffee
and get your questions ready we could
start with
the agenda so we've got first up is
pavel
our very own pablo privilovka from
everex and he's going to give us some
updates on the strategic committee
yeah thank you john for introducing
um so we
uh have as you probably know every
thursday uh every thursday strategic
committees and uh the last committee was
devoted to
uh drive chain so there was
quite a
[Music]
big presentation by the team of
architecture of drive chain
there was quite
a
intense discussion after that
as far as i understand uh
pretty much later on by the way it was
it continued in the group strategic air
strategy group
uh at the moment i think community or
say k members
questions were answered
by the team
and
from my perspective
architecture of draft chain was
almost finalized
so i think that uh we will have uh
supplementary discussion uh this
thursday on the next strategic committee
uh but it will it will be more about uh
like roadmap and timing
in architectural wise i think we are
pretty much uh discussed everything and
uh
agreed on uh
what stages there will be in uh driving
implementation
for those who would like who are
interested i can say that the most uh
complexity came from the
fact that
there was a
there was an idea that we should how uh
in this industrial industrialist way uh
to guarantee that um users be able to
read
a file because you can store a file but
you can
uh
as a as a knot holder you can
block the ability of the node to provide
that file
actually
but you still as a node you will be able
to provide proofs that you store it so
that was the most uh
complex part in discussion
so my view and it looks like that it is
the common view of all k members is that
we should
make the first draft
storage
part first because it is very important
and this required acp for different
applications and for
that part
where we
we can even not face that that problem
but if we will face the problem there
are some solutions which are discussed
and
um
it could be done on the
second stage
of the
dressing development
also i would like to add that that
problem
actually it is not addressed in other
systems in other the sterile storage
systems so this is a bit visionary point
which was mentioned first time in invite
paper
so now we
need to get first
solution which works with storage
at least alone
hope it was clear
okay thank you pavel does anybody have
any questions
not immediately maybe at the end uh okay
so we're going to move on quickly to
katarina she is a team lead at everex
and she's going to give us a short
announcement on evercloud a psa
hello everyone let me share my screen
okay i have a very short presentation
today it's just one
slide um this is basically just a
friendly reminder for everyone that
starting from uh the 9th of september
there will be only authorized access to
the evercloud so please
proceed to dashboard overcloud.dev and
get your access credentials
um this is like very simple
so you basically
follow this guide
and
this the link to this guide will be
under the video
and
so just basically you create a project
and this is it and you just get your end
points
and you can uh use them as you did
before you just specify the endpoint
with your project id
in your client
config
and that's it
so
like this is very easy and
just to remind you again that you have
two weeks left
so please
do it and uh also don't worry there will
be
no billing yet
and anyway even when we introduce
billing it will be a freemium
subscription so if you have small
number of requests it will still be free
for you and um if you have any like
questions or problems you can
message to our channel
and you can message to me directly
so
this is basically
it what i wanted to say
thank you
well so what if someone doesn't claim
access within two weeks what happens
does anything happen to
what they will have no access
would they just go up to a
a gate a gateway
and then yeah just uh the api will just
reject their requests so
this is very important
okay
cool get it done
okay thank you katarina stick around if
we've got any questions so
let's move on the agenda uh actually
we've got a three in one this one's a
doozy for all of you out there
we've got um
evercraft the plugin for minecraft and
we're going to talk about a new
partnership between broxas and da5 which
is one of the philippines most popular
money transfer services
and it's actually been in the
philippines market for 15 years now
and also there's a super cool nft
collection called roxy family
everybody's seeing that in the chats
very cool website as well pretty
evocative of uh board apes
and so we're super lucky today to have
vlad with us who's the ceo of roxas and
he's going to tell us all about
everything
hey guys
yeah long time no see
uh so actually you see on my
avatar so one one of the examples of the
broxy family so
i will get to it a bit a bit later
um so right now hello everyone so just
to see me
uh so i will start from uh this great
partnership with the e5 uh it's
something uh as a
one of the greatest results of work of
our asian team
so as you may know now broxus is
quite a worldwide company with
offices in different parts of the world
including europe middle east and asia
and uh agreement with the five uh was a
result successful presentation of
everscale technology and easiness with
which you can
create a sustainable business in our
scale uh using already in place
technologies unlike many of other
competing ecosystems
and actually what makes it really great
is that indonesia is one of the major
remittance markets in the world because
indonesian
citizens they are working all around the
world and regularly sent money to the
friends and families back to indonesia
not without even saying uh
about the local remnants market
and also payments and
all this kind of stuff
and uh of course in asian region uh
remittance is something we uh
really
believe in um because this market can
create the organic uh
workload for for our ecosystem for
everscale as a whole and
getting big strong strategic
partnerships with local players is a key
for it uh so right now what we are
discussing is the creation of uh not
only of integration of overscale into
the remittance stream but also about the
creation of uh
stable peso uh with a perspective of
going towards
cbdc project
however
so right now so we're at the mvp stage
and we
are running some tests and making
integration with the a5
so and hopefully we will be able to
present something within a few weeks
and uh what also makes the five
a great partner is that they really
open-minded and ready for innovations
and experiments and
so they're really hungry for innovations
so that's why uh
everscale is a great choice uh for them
as well as they are the great partner
for our ecosystem
besides the e5 of course uh our asian
team is now uh
scouting uh
all asian markets for uh strategic
partnerships
and uh
hopefully there will be
a number of them until end of the year
so we will keep you updated on this
point as well
uh do you have any questions at this
point on the e5
any questions anybody sounds good sounds
cool
uh so let's move on to uh
evercraft update so that's actually uh
many of you may have seen this news that
microsoft has suspended
the
nfts on minecraft platform so and i
would like just maybe uh to comment a
bit
on how it works so actually uh minecraft
is one of the
if not the largest
metaverses
all around the world with more than 200
million only official players
and
at least 400 million of sold copies of
the game
and
in order for a player to access the game
so
he should have the microsoft account so
actually micros minecraft server
in fact accesses uh the
microsoft authorization server however
uh microsoft hasn't released the uh
official uh update on the terms yet and
uh so soon they do this so we will
carefully study but until then so we
consider evercraft being uh not
only uh minecraft related uh
product but it's also
rather the practical implementation of
metaverse sdk and
we have done a really good great
behind the curtains work on uh
upgrading our architecture and
rethinking it uh to make it uh
really uh flexible and suitable for
different kinds of games and maybe we
will rename our craft it's it's not uh
confirmed yet but we're thinking about
this as well
just to detach from from uh minecraft
specifically
uh so in the coming upgrades for
evercraft so we are planning to
introduce
the uh
tokenization of the land uh so and right
now we're integrating with
uh the major uh
uh property access uh plugin for
minecraft called wallguard
so uh
developed by a group of enthusiasts and
now right now we estimate it's used at
least by sixty percent of uh
service worldwide
and uh also as you may have seen so we
uh
have committed the upgrade for the nlt
standard that will has included the
metaverse region uh object so and that
can be now used by uh all other games
that are developed on everscale so to
make it the industrial standard and we
are also working now on uh the
following uh upgrade to the standard
including the tokenization of
buildings sculptures objects of any kind
because this is a really big big market
that's very interested and
in my discussion with different
investors
and
market players so everybody is looking
for such kind of solutions
uh so we are planning to
release uh
the next update hopefully uh
beginning of september or middle of
september so right now we are
integrating
and uh of course we will first upgrade
our demo server however i want to try uh
how it works and uh
later on so we will
roll out the the full release to all of
servers
um
yeah so also we are working now on the
evercraft website uh that will
describe more in details about the
product and how you can use it on your
server and how you can integrate and
expand the functionality
and all this kind of stuff
uh
yeah so
i think this is the end of this update
so if you have questions please
yeah um there actually is a question for
evercraft so we can
do that right now uh horizon asked
what actually is evercraft is it a
partnership with minecraft or just some
applications are integrated from
minecraft
uh to form evercraft
oh it's independent product so that uses
the minecraft
well minecraft model to integrate with
everscale using the standard overscale
endpoints including graphql
okay i i
put it on a note to
get the keys
for not to break anything
and also it uses the
broxas
wallet api uh to create and maintain as
a gamer's wallet so it has uh well a
decent uh
security encryption system that allows
you to be
sure that nobody will steal
your funds from your wallet even the
administrator of the server
and this
the main idea that was standing behind
our craft is that
how easy you can use the on-chain
transfers uh
between players
in a big traditional game so meaning
that you just put the plugin
in your plugins folder you configure it
very simply five or six lines of
configuration and that's it so uh all
your players can now enjoy the
real cryptocurrency wallets inside the
game and make the transfers by just
username and
also enjoy the
built-in
resources market marketplace and further
one tokenize your land property and so
on and so forth so quite a lot of ideas
uh what can be implemented there
but the main thing here is simplicity so
how
easy you can use cryptocurrency in a
convenient game
great explanation so are the only
materials you have for evercraft you
have got a github link and you have a
telegram chat is there anything else
that we can point people to
uh yes that's what i'm saying so we're
currently working on the website so uh
because our crop team is is very small
so it's only three people are working on
it but if you want to contribute so
please don't hesitate to contact me
and uh further on so of course we plan
to uh
expand uh
our social medias and start posting
something in there so as soon as we get
closer to
uh the next update so i think that in
september so we will have already the
full set of uh social media website and
all that kind of stuff
fantastic we have another question from
bolte bolte the creators of minecraft
have officially refused to support nft
technology how will this affect your
project
that's what i actually explained so the
main
risk that microsoft imposes on server
administrators that they will ban the
servers from the authorization
channel but in fact
this is the risk that every
administrator will take on on his own
because
there are quite a number of different
projects
who are implementing different kinds of
nfts
in in minecraft so we are not the first
one of course because
uh our main object was to make the open
system that any server can use without
uh
building players to our own servers of
course we will have a couple of our own
servers
to just showcase the possibilities of
the system but the main idea is that we
would like to popularize our scale with
this product and
make it extremely easy for you to try
and to configure and all that kind of
stuff
i
don't understand for now from the
technical standpoint how would
microsoft ban
all the servers that would try to use
this kind of uh
product because you can switch nft
support off and you will just get the
simple cryptocurrency transactions in
game so that's very easy
and uh
of course we will warn all the server
administrators about such risk but in
the end so it's open system and it's
something every admin should decide on
their own
uh i will not say even about the
amount of servers that i'm not using
microsoft authorization so and providing
the access to players
through alternative authentication
services so and
this is something
this is
also a very big market and last but not
least is that again aircraft is not uh
only about minecraft so the system that
we are building is actually dedicated
for building the uh metaverse ecosystem
metaverse sdk uh that will be capable of
expanding to different games like gta
like i don't know world of uh warcraft
or something like this uh more of course
of games that are more of economic uh
orientation where you have something to
tokenize and
something to uh to sell and to buy so
where already internal economics exist
but
in the end the architect current
architecture of evercraft allows you to
easily write the server clients for the
ecosystem and integrate it
very fast
fantastic that's a lot of information i
think you're free to move on to the
super snazzy uh
yeah yeah okay
uh just let me show the
screen yeah with a website of proxy
so actually uh proxy has uh quite a long
story because we had uh if someone
remembers in past we had the support
account that was named proxy and in
telegram
who was helping uh
to users of telegram boards and
of our other systems
but since then so we have
it has evolved and now we
have the whole family of proxy
characters
uh
the collection was a uh in fact uh
has started initially not as an official
process product but rather
as an initiative of several several
employees of roxas who just wanted to to
add some fun to our
uh strict and serious
defy positioning so and they started to
think about uh what we can create about
the
the nft collection that we can create to
reflect better the uh
nature and the character
of uh of the people who are building
brock's products and in fact uh
if someone knows us so
he would
say and confirm that
there are people in brooks are really
extraordinary and
they're very interesting they have
a rich personalities and but typically
nobody sees that and that's uh what was
the point where broxy has appeared
and uh guys has found has found uh the
artist who was standing behind several
big nft collections successfully
collections and you can see the that uh
artist's style so is something like uh
retrofitters some cyberpunks
all mixed together
these neon colors uh
so everything uh looking really really
neat and cool so and uh
it's it's not uh
really uh
serious at all
so you see it's more like a hooligan
collection so uh with all different kind
of uh characters uh doing all the
typical things that traditional people
do
and uh
if you know some of roxas employees so
you may try to to identify
uh several people who are standing
behind this was its character
so and uh
the main idea of the collection that we
not only can build
serious and reliable products but we
also can enjoy our life and and party
and uh
really do all the stuff we we want and
we believe the right
and uh we get a lot of fun from our work
and uh this is actually the essence of
this collection
right now so uh the collection and all
the trades are ready and so we have a
lot of uh
extremely good trades and in my opinion
this is one of the best nft collections
i have ever seen so because
i personally was uh more like a
spectator looking at how this
thing was created and you will see when
it goes really live
how many fort and
creativity was put in this collection
uh
but uh behind being just a cool set of
pictures so the idea that we have in our
mind that uh this collection will also
have some utility value and the owners
of
different uh nfts from this collection
will get certain privileges
and
you can see this here so this is these
are just examples so it's not finalized
yet that's what we'll may update in
future uh but uh the generic idea is
that uh getting these nfts will uh
as you know of our products will uh let
you uh get the better offering and
will let you improve your customer
experience and enjoy our products even
more
and uh
this is something standing really on the
other line of our product
and i really really enjoy it
i think it's fantastic i love it it's
very creative and i love how you're
bringing the human nature into into
boxes
know you let people come and connect
with you
on the human level and enjoy it so
that was a great initiative
also it looks awesome
i
i know we have questions about this
first one is when can i buy a proxy nft
when can i buy it
we are currently making the all the
preparations for opening the
sale so the exact date is not
finalized but we
expected to to the sale to happen uh
within
a month or two so
most probably we will try to to finalize
everything by mid-september but uh so
there are quite a lot of things that you
need to think when you're launching such
a nifty collection
and uh so i would say
no stress
so but just enjoy the preparation stage
and so we will run a lot of activities
where you can win the access to the
white list and uh certain uh discounts
for this collection uh so uh we we want
you to
enjoy this this prep stage
as well as the collection itself
yeah i saw a message in in the uh roxy
chat that there are some easter eggs
throughout the website i found some of
them but i was wondering is is there are
you doing something with the easter eggs
like is this a hint um
i will not say anything
[Laughter]
secret okay that's a secret
just be attentive yeah
i found some
i would say that the the website is not
static
so it updates time to time oh
so we gotta come back and keep looking
absolutely
interesting
[Music]
very cool thanks vlad
alrighty uh
so if you're done sharing roxy we're
gonna move on to all the other general
questions unless there are people on the
call
who
immediately have any questions i don't
see any hands so
let's move on to community
so
uh one of the questions uh someone wants
to know has michael left the project or
not
who wants to take this question
anybody i can tweak this of course which
project ever scale
i think he means every skill
of course not um i mean as we said many
times at amaze sessions and um i
recorded something today in interviews
that should be out in the next couple of
days
meet you left the role of cto of everex
and to focus on gosh which is a very
resourceful and uh you know promising
project and it requires full dedication
because there is no other way
uh then somebody um
like media and obviously there are a lot
of other team members
and external teams who are helping to
pull the gosh off so media is fully
focused on gosh however
he stayed in the what is called
strategic committee which is a technical
committee to
steer a kind of business needs of the
network into the technical uh specs
and the technical requirements and meet
is a very active vocal member of the
technical committee
and it happens every thursday so he in
that capacity he continues to influence
the architecture of the network
well
mitch is still here he's just focused
heads down
uh maybe we can get him on a call soon
too um
so thanks alex next question is when is
pr and marketing when is that going to
start
maybe uh vlad can jump in here
uh sorry say it again maybe you can jump
in uh do you have any insights on what's
going on with pr and marketing
because uh alex is in here so
maybe yeah actually so it's it's quite
quite a lot of ease is done on the
permanent basis so uh
i'm not really deep in the process of
marketing dr but what i see from what
guys are reporting so we have
at least three or four teams working in
parallel in different markets including
uh
korea south korea japan indonesia
malaysia and other markets in the region
so
as sergey said so
now overscale is strongly focused on the
asian region and
that's why
a lot of efforts i applied there so a
lot a big number of publications uh are
coming out in local language and also
thanks to our south korean team so we've
got really strong presence in uh in
naver so which is the uh i don't know
how to name it uh
uh main communication platform or main
source of news for for a korean
community
and uh
yeah so i don't have uh figures but uh i
see a lot of uh things that are done
currently
yeah the question was when will it start
and the answer is it's been going on for
a while and it's never stopped i would
say like this and it's
still increasing and now we have these
new channels um that you can check
for for insights of growth
so maybe um who's asking this question
should join that channel too and then
they can actually see some real numbers
if that's what they're looking for
um and another question is
when new listings
wasn't there coin
when new listing someone wants to know
the answer is usual soon
yeah yeah actually so uh
we are now as you may have seen so with
the recent acquisitions of hobby and
kucoin so we
have entered the tier one uh listings so
and of course
we discuss with all other exchanges but
due to this
winter period
so uh the discussion has slowed down a
little
uh however so we now try also to
leverage as much as we can from current
listings and you may have seen the
one
good example of such initiative with uh
launching the staking on kucoin
and
you may have seen the proposal on
everdel
and
this is a great experiment and we will
carefully measure the
metrics of
how it goes on
and
this may drag a lot of attention a lot
of new users a lot of new validators to
the network which is
actually something that we are looking
for
and uh if this experiment goes
successfully so of course it will be
scaled to to our other partners as well
and that's for listings so just
keep an eye so you you should understand
that it's a
sensitive question and
we may not disclose even the fact that
we uh
discuss with certain specific exchange
not to ruin the negotiations
so just keep an eye on the news channels
you will not get to know the first one
okay great uh we're very lucky to have
you here today because i have another
question for you
what
what stable coins are in the everwallet
app
uh actually in aero wallet tab so you
may find all the stable coins that are
currently white listed so it's
robbed to use the tear up to dc and die
also uh
you may have seen the upi uh this is a
native stable coin forever scale
packed to euro and
backed by by real euros so it's classic
stable coin
and uh also as soon as uh the da5 stable
coin uh is finalized and
dually packed
so
of course it will be added as well to
our wallet
um
if you have your own stablecoin project
so uh
there are quite clear and transparent uh
whitelisting rules so
most probably we will remind about them
so
there are quite clear criteria on how to
get to the white list to ensure your
stable con as well is there
okay great thank you
i don't have any more questions none
from the community and unless anybody
has any questions on the call here then
i think we're good
so stay tuned for the next everscale
community call uh
two weeks on september 6th is the next
one and we're going to talk to easy pay
and see if it's up with chess nft
something new there and exciting and of
course some more presentations
and projects and more stuff on the way
so thank you everybody for joining us
thank you for watching and have a great
rest of your week
bye everybody bye
