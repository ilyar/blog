architecture of draft chain was
almost finalized

180
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
almost finalized
 

181
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,190
almost finalized
so i think that uh we will have uh

182
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
so i think that uh we will have uh
 

183
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,110
so i think that uh we will have uh
supplementary discussion uh this

184
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
supplementary discussion uh this
 

185
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,710
supplementary discussion uh this
thursday on the next strategic committee

186
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
thursday on the next strategic committee
 

187
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,670
thursday on the next strategic committee
uh but it will it will be more about uh

188
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
uh but it will it will be more about uh
 

189
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,830
uh but it will it will be more about uh
like roadmap and timing

190
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
like roadmap and timing
 

191
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,390
like roadmap and timing
in architectural wise i think we are

192
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
in architectural wise i think we are
 

193
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,990
in architectural wise i think we are
pretty much uh discussed everything and

194
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
pretty much uh discussed everything and
 

195
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,070
pretty much uh discussed everything and
uh

196
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
uh
 

197
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,990
uh
agreed on uh

198
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
agreed on uh
 

199
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,550
agreed on uh
what stages there will be in uh driving

200
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
what stages there will be in uh driving
 

201
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,310
what stages there will be in uh driving
implementation

202
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
implementation
 

203
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,710
implementation
for those who would like who are

204
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
for those who would like who are
 

205
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,990
for those who would like who are
interested i can say that the most uh

206
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
interested i can say that the most uh
 

207
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,150
interested i can say that the most uh
complexity came from the

208
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
complexity came from the
 

209
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,510
complexity came from the
fact that

210
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
fact that
 

211
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,629
fact that
there was a

212
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
there was a
 

213
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,150
there was a
there was an idea that we should how uh

214
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
there was an idea that we should how uh
 

215
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,030
there was an idea that we should how uh
in this industrial industrialist way uh

216
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
in this industrial industrialist way uh
 

217
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,909
in this industrial industrialist way uh
to guarantee that um users be able to

218
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919
to guarantee that um users be able to
 

219
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:36,870
to guarantee that um users be able to
read

220
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
read
 

221
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,430
read
a file because you can store a file but

222
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
a file because you can store a file but
 

223
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,469
a file because you can store a file but
you can

224
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
you can
 

225
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,350
you can
uh

226
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
uh
 

227
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,749
uh
as a as a knot holder you can

228
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
as a as a knot holder you can
 

229
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,150
as a as a knot holder you can
block the ability of the node to provide

230
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
block the ability of the node to provide
 

231
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,350
block the ability of the node to provide
that file

232
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360

 

233
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,550

actually

234
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
actually
 

235
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,469
actually
but you still as a node you will be able

236
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
but you still as a node you will be able
 

237
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,189
but you still as a node you will be able
to provide proofs that you store it so

238
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
to provide proofs that you store it so
 

239
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,590
to provide proofs that you store it so
that was the most uh

240
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
that was the most uh
 

241
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,790
that was the most uh
complex part in discussion

242
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
complex part in discussion
 

243
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,749
complex part in discussion
so my view and it looks like that it is

244
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
so my view and it looks like that it is
 

245
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,670
so my view and it looks like that it is
the common view of all k members is that

246
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
the common view of all k members is that
 

247
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,550
the common view of all k members is that
we should

248
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
we should
 

249
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,550
we should
make the first draft

250
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
make the first draft
 

251
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,070
make the first draft
storage

252
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
storage
 

253
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,990
storage
part first because it is very important

254
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
part first because it is very important
 

255
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,629
part first because it is very important
and this required acp for different

256
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
and this required acp for different
 

257
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,629
and this required acp for different
applications and for

258
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
applications and for
 

259
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,550
applications and for
that part

260
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
that part
 

261
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,870
that part
where we

262
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
where we
 

263
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,510
where we
we can even not face that that problem

264
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
we can even not face that that problem
 

265
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,670
we can even not face that that problem
but if we will face the problem there

266
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
but if we will face the problem there
 

267
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,909
but if we will face the problem there
are some solutions which are discussed

268
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
are some solutions which are discussed
 

269
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,510
are some solutions which are discussed
and

270
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
and
 

271
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,189
and
um

272
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
um
 

273
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,830
um
it could be done on the

274
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840
it could be done on the
 

275
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,430
it could be done on the
second stage

276
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
second stage
 

277
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,150
second stage
of the

278
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160
of the
 

279
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,870
of the
dressing development

280
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
dressing development
 

281
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,350
dressing development
also i would like to add that that

282
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
also i would like to add that that
 

283
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,749
also i would like to add that that
problem

284
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
problem
 

285
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,550
problem
actually it is not addressed in other

286
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
actually it is not addressed in other
 

287
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,950
actually it is not addressed in other
systems in other the sterile storage

288
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
systems in other the sterile storage
 

289
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,670
systems in other the sterile storage
systems so this is a bit visionary point

290
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
systems so this is a bit visionary point
 

291
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,550
systems so this is a bit visionary point
which was mentioned first time in invite

292
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
which was mentioned first time in invite
 

293
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,469
which was mentioned first time in invite
paper

294
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
paper
 

295
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,150
paper
so now we

296
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
so now we
 

297
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,270
so now we
need to get first

298
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
need to get first
 

299
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,430
need to get first
solution which works with storage

300
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
solution which works with storage
 

301
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,110
solution which works with storage
at least alone

302
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120

 

303
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,749

hope it was clear

304
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
hope it was clear
 

305
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,350
hope it was clear

one
 

1715
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,590
one
good example of such initiative with uh

1716
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:45,600
good example of such initiative with uh
 

1717
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,549
good example of such initiative with uh
launching the staking on kucoin

1718
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:48,559
launching the staking on kucoin
 

1719
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,430
launching the staking on kucoin
and

1720
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,440
and
 

1721
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,269
and
you may have seen the proposal on

1722
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:51,279
you may have seen the proposal on
 

1723
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,389
you may have seen the proposal on
everdel

1724
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:52,399
everdel
 

1725
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,590
everdel
and

1726
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:53,600
and
 

1727
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,830
and
this is a great experiment and we will

1728
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:55,840
this is a great experiment and we will
 

1729
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,230
this is a great experiment and we will
carefully measure the

1730
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:58,240
carefully measure the
 

1731
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,750
carefully measure the
metrics of

1732
00:33:59,750 --> 00:33:59,760
metrics of
 

1733
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,269
metrics of
how it goes on

1734
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:01,279
how it goes on
 

1735
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,149
how it goes on
and

1736
00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:02,159
and
 

1737
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,710
and
this may drag a lot of attention a lot

1738
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:04,720
this may drag a lot of attention a lot
 

1739
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,110
this may drag a lot of attention a lot
of new users a lot of new validators to

1740
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,120
of new users a lot of new validators to
 

1741
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,109
of new users a lot of new validators to
the network which is

1742
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:09,119
the network which is
 

1743
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,629
the network which is
actually something that we are looking

1744
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:10,639
actually something that we are looking
 

1745
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,430
actually something that we are looking
for

1746
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:11,440
for
 

1747
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,349
for
and uh if this experiment goes

1748
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:13,359
and uh if this experiment goes
 

1749
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,270
and uh if this experiment goes
successfully so of course it will be

1750
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:15,280
successfully so of course it will be
 

1751
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,069
successfully so of course it will be
scaled to to our other partners as well

1752
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:20,079
scaled to to our other partners as well
 

1753
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,230
scaled to to our other partners as well

1799
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,990
native stable coin forever scale
packed to euro and

1800
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,000
packed to euro and
 

1801
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,470
packed to euro and
backed by by real euros so it's classic

1802
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:16,480
backed by by real euros so it's classic
 

1803
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,990

stable coin
 

1805
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,630
stable coin
and uh also as soon as uh the da5 stable

1806
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:22,640
and uh also as soon as uh the da5 stable
 

1807
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,150
and uh also as soon as uh the da5 stable
coin uh is finalized and

1808
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,160
coin uh is finalized and
 

1809
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,670
coin uh is finalized and
dually packed

1810
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:27,680
dually packed
 

1811
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,870
dually packed
so

1812
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:28,880
so
 

1813
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,710
so
of course it will be added as well to

if you have your own stablecoin project
 

1821
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,430
if you have your own stablecoin project
so uh

1822
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:37,440
so uh
 

1823
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,710
so uh
there are quite clear and transparent uh

there are quite clear and transparent uh
whitelisting rules so

1826
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,040
whitelisting rules so
 

1827
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,349
whitelisting rules so
most probably we will remind about them

1828
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:45,359
most probably we will remind about them
 

1829
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,230
most probably we will remind about them
so

so
 

1831
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,069
so
there are quite clear criteria on how to

1832
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:48,079
there are quite clear criteria on how to
 

1833
