hi
yep
okay so we start now okay then well
hello everybody and welcome to the infam
ama where we are going to be learning
about the infam project and the proposed
partnership between triad labs and
everscale i'm joanne from everex and
today i have olga kaminskaya cvo of
infam to tell us more about the
project's plans
and integration with everscale
so welcome olga pleasure to meet you and
please feel free to introduce yourself
and tell us a bit about tryota labs and
the platform in fam
um great um thank you for having me here
and uh it's my pleasure to tell the
details about our great project
which i personally really adore
um we started out um
in december um a little bit even earlier
but let me first
uh say a couple of words about myself um
i am the
ceo of the project um
which means
uh chief visionary officer
and this is for a reason
i'm not from the young generation of the
digital
entrepreneurs and technical people but
i'm happy to be with them
for 30 years i have been
engaged in
big companies and strong corporations
for strategy and for
finance
i have been working as cfos of several
startups
and finally
around two years ago i landed myself
within the nft technology
and started up the
together with
another partner
an nft agency
and we can solve big corporations and uh
uh small companies and start our
projects about how to implement the nft
technology so they can be
um really fruitful and
up to
you know up to date at the uh
spearheading uh the uh process
um in farm
in the idea of it came into being
somewhere around the this bearish market
um around the summer
uh when
lots of stem startups started having
very big issues with the marketing with
selecting influencers and ambassadors
with
fulfilling all the
obligations and
all the agreements between them
also
a lot of
influencers and ambassadors are scared
away by the by a lot of scam projects
which you already know are very very
um
i mean they are abundant in the market
and it's so hard now to find out if it's
just a genuine fork of something or
really some
scamming scheme that is going to really
affect the reputation that people worked
hard to um
develop and to maintain among all the
popular public
info marries
three kinds of people inside it
its influencers its uh
ambassadors its uh uh investors
and the first role of the platform is
projects
uh the projects meaning the startups
which we verify
are as being
honest as being clear with their
most
well almost material factors
and we also verify the influences and
the ambassadors for the projects they
had
for the impact they had on the projects
uh how the uh how in fact uh the
cooperation between the projects and the
influences and bass and ambassadors
uh grew uh
for the benefits of both
um we have our special technology to do
that
uh to register
we offer everyone everyone to register
it is an easy simple project but we have
a very precise
questionnaire which you answer and
only after we verify everything uh you
get
the actual um
access to all
of the
informs
functions and to the in front of rating
system
uh basically it's simple the higher you
are on the rating on income the more
people are trying to get you as your
influencer or ambassador or a project
that they want to come in
um investor role
by the way we have uh now registered
about 85 percent of the
registered
users are or
investors
um the investor role is a little bit
different we wanted people to um
have the opportunity to enjoy
best selected projects to participate in
the launch pad uh when
it's just
being
implemented we had already two um
launchpad uh projects uh two projects on
the launchpad and it's kind of um
working okay so far
uh
even the talking given the market it's
quite all right for now
so basically
the highest rating and you can
better your rate rating by uh posting
some
uh
topics opening discussions fulfilling
the contracts uh um asking for
consultations and performing the
consultations and all that kind of thing
we are here
on the blockchain for everyone to verify
and certify on the blockchain
that all the
orders are fulfilled correctly that all
the payments are paid timely and for the
well
done job
this is how we see our
place in this market
um originally we strive um
for the position when being verified on
the uh the income
is going to be you know like a star
if you verify there you are really a
good uh
member of the market a good market
player
uh honest and very fruitful um this is
maybe the best things i want to do
to talk about the platform okay
more questions
yeah um
that was a
really good oversight thank you very
much um i've noticed that there are
different products on your platform on
the infam platform so can you tell us a
little bit about what you already have
you did touch on it a bit already
but i did notice that you also have
analytics
and marketing and
based on what you've just shared
analytics
and marketing and
based on what you've just shared it kind
of also sounds like a full circle
marketing ecosystem where somebody can
not only hire somebody but also apply to
be an ambassador for ambassador for
example is that so
yes exactly um thank you you got it
quite right
um hopefully
more and more people understand that
being
verified
being
open and clear to the public
gives you just more opportunity to earn
better money into to hire
for higher income
we have the system uh that uh allows
people to chat between themselves yeah
uh
we have it it's a simple product so
there is no i mean it's not a rocket
science you just use it as a chatting um
um for uh if uh
you need to contact someone uh this is a
private chat chat
box
uh also uh there is a whole system uh
how to order something on the platform
um if you
look through the influences for example
being a startup
you probably selected a couple of them
that you really like but maybe they're
on the topic that's your startup is
touching
maybe you know them when you want to
connect with them uh it's uh uh you
address them through the private chart
you show them the details and send them
the details about your project
you give them the task what do you want
them to do
and if the order is accepted
the
influencer
[Music]
is going to
have the um
um
it's it's like a locked wallet where the
payment is until the whole system
verifies that the job was uh
really deformed up to the task and all
the parties are happy so then they
receive the
money are you are you currently using
any smart contract system for this
yes absolutely it's our private smart
contract system also um with uh before
we started on uh bsc vsc
um then we had also um
polygon now we integrated with polygon
right now it's also a quite recent event
but of course while we're here that's
because we integrated with everscale
uh personally i'm very much fond of
everscale i
also
hold all their
funks um but um we see everscale as one
of the most modern
uh very
high capacity and
high speed
uh
chain uh which we plan to use for more
and more
now
uh starting just the recent days
um
for us um everscale is a strategic
partner
and uh maybe i'm just going forward a
little bit but for us
everscale uh means that we can join in
with uh try the
accelerator uh exchanging
all our capacities all our um skills and
competencies uh
with ever scale to accelerate uh
projects um
here we also can be as
fulfilling three functions
uh first one
while fi well the first function is that
we
can
provide a whole pipeline of projects
already verified
um
that because startups are registering
with us
um also we provide the whole marketing
plan
uh and um in our strategy we even have
some um artificial intelligence plans
when
after
working with all the big data that we
have we could offer already
the automatic plan
which influences should be used maybe
which ambassadors should be contacted uh
given the topic and the stage of the
startup that that we offer
and of course our community um together
with everscape community allows to
promote and to give the people
opportunity to invest safely
to invest directly without any
intermediaries and to give
to be provided with all the first-hand
information from the uh projects uh from
the team project teams
is that somehow answered
yes i think you've also answered a few
questions which is great oh thank you
very much
[Laughter]
we are so excited to talk about the
platform yeah it does happen
it does it sounds like an exciting
project and
there is definitely a lot to to talk
about and much more to share then we
could squeeze into a little ama
um
i do have another question um
and it's about your roadmap on your
website there is a very comprehensive
roadmap and on the infam website and so
i was wondering if you could please tell
us
what might be specific specifically on
the roadmap in the near future that
could be exciting for
everscale
um
we are right now um
well i don't know if i should
give more attention to the whole thing
but right now we're in the phase three
um
and we have been um already
on the stage where
um
we have the um
we are looking now for collaboration
with projects at asia europe and america
and
now we are implementing the dlt
technologies between the users inside
the platform
and it is very important for us to have
every scale is also the capacity and the
high speed technology uh which is our
privilege is a privilege to have
right now we have already um launched
and successfully sold the nft collection
representing uh the dao membership it's
like
nft pass that gives you incredible
opportunities to participate inside be
white listed and share in the platform
profits
and
currently we're thinking and
implementing some additional tools which
i mentioned
uh which help us to
uh analyze the big data and to uh build
the artificial intelligence algorithms
or for better services for automated
services for the
clients um
next stage we're planning to launch on
uh
some second uh
sec exchange uh centralized exchange
right now we have been traded on
cryptology
um
and also we have a beautiful farming
pool on the everscale farming platform
for that matter
for those who are interested in the
talking
and like to yeah i like to see more
profits just coming in right now
um first uh
first of all i think we're all here to
earn money so i don't
hesitate to mention that
um according to the roadmap our phase
four should be starting um around the
end of the year where we will be
launching the mobile application
and uh we'll be launching the updated
platform version
two zero
any more questions here okay i was
looking forward to that i was going to
ask you about the nft as much i also
noticed on the website but but you went
into that um you told us a bit about the
benefits so thank you
um would you be able to tell us
a bit about the kind of users you
already have on the platform and what is
the audience like um can you give us any
insights into the daily activity on your
platform
um surely um we have been um
so far we have been really manually
registering everyone
because we wanted to check all our
technology how to verify the audiences
how to verify
uh the technical spread um for those
specific people who are
ambassadors and influencers
right now we have
as i told already by the way uh
investors are 85 percent of the
platform users
insurances are about uh 23 24
and
projects are
also
these are the projects that have been
verified they have been checked for they
all the documentation
their materials have been scanned we
have been talking to them uh and
had already two projects launched on the
launch pad as i said
and we have six
percent of ambassadors
um
there are all kinds of nations there are
people working for the asian market for
the china market
for
south american markets
um and
all the
um influencers and ambassadors are the
people that we work personally
with on other projects or we are having
accepting them by the recommendations of
our closest friends
um daily uh we have several projects on
boarding and
there are more investors it's
understandable because we are um
circulating around the investors and
just having um so many acquaintances
here we just offer people
to comment to see um and to validate in
the platform but their participation
daily we have
several orders
for each uh almost each uh influencer
um
i would know the exact numbers right now
because it's not particularly my job but
um
but it's active it's currently active
and working right now so that's yeah
that's exciting
um so you have the platform and you have
the infam launch pad
um so can you tell us any projects that
you've already launched and are there
any success stories or anything that you
would like to highlight there
specifically for the launch pad
uh launchpad we have two um
two launches so far
uh the first was the test one uh it's uh
for our internal project just to see how
it works and uh verify all the
uh chain processes and uh the second uh
we actually after that we returned the
money to the people because
it was more um
convenient for us just to to test it
this way
uh for the
other uh the second one it was a
successful game plus placement um and
i'm sure we'll have another ammo with
the guys to show how they're happy about
it it would just happen a couple of days
uh we connect and collected about
uh three and three hundred thousand
dollars uh at the first uh stage and
that's great
yeah i think for the first thing um
being really
not so chilled
as a launch pad it's a really good
result yeah yeah
uh you've mentioned briefly that you're
building an accelerator with everscale
which is exciting so can you please tell
us more about the goals here and how it
could benefit everscale
um
yeah yeah i think it's an incredible
opportunity for for all of us
because
here on our platform
we have good strategic alliances
with
the three group
which is a big gaming platform
that's
like a gaming fund rather
that
collects a lot of original traditional
games and puts them on the blockchain
keeping in mind that
all the
projects that can be in real life they
also can be uh positioned and married
with the blockchain to give
people more opportunities in the digital
world yeah
[Music]
another partner we have is a big
marketing agency which allows us to
implement all kinds of media planning
assessment of media planning
uh assessment of the budgets uh we as a
platform can uh verify and give all our
competencies about how to implement
different blockchains
um especially every scale but still uh
also there are um situations there are
aims um and purposes of the project when
you can
be
um
choosing between uh what to do on a
blockchain with a half of the coins and
what to do with the help of the energy
um it's um
maybe a little bit too technical
for now but generally we would allow all
the projects that come to us
to be presented to the error scale if
they deserve that if for some reason
they're still not
of that scale
we can scale them up all together
and can offer them for the ever skill as
a filter like the filter and barrier for
for those
minimizing the um
time waste for the ever scale as well
okay
well that's interesting um are there any
parts of the platform or the accelerator
that will be using every scale
technology i know that uh
a the launch pad you can use um wallet
connect and metamask um are there any
plans to integrate ever wallet or surf
we have already integrated the ever kit
it's a
[Music]
it's a project on ever everscale
uh it's already integrated into the
platform so we're going to use that
and i'm sure we will be using everything
that our scale offers because
i mean it's obvious for us so that we
promote uh for the projects using
everscale technology everything
everything genius they will come up with
we will implement them into those
projects
okay um to circle back on the uh nft
token the utility token specifically
that i saw on your website uh the
launchpad
website states
you can stake inf tokens
to get boosts to promising projects can
you explain what a boost might entail
and any other benefits that this token
might bring
well
let me a little bit return uh back to
the nft
the
um nfts um uh were launched as the
uh participation passed uh in the dao
organization
if you have our nft
but you as a client are automatically
white listed for all the launchpad
project
uh if you hold an nft longer than one
year you are entitled to orange profit
sharing
from the profit of the platform
um
um the quarterly if for less than a year
then just
for the year profit
okay
also uh for the in
in some uh nfts uh we hold a separate
absolutely intimate and close discord
channel where we discuss all
important projects and they have the
uh very first
rate information about what's going to
happen to the projects about insights
and things like that it's not inside the
trading
no
by no means
but it gives us the opportunity
to provide the high-skilled
high-quality
people our shareholders
with information intimate information
about the projects that we
are in touch with
um
what about the token the token has been
launched somewhere
in the last year in the at the end of
the last year it survived already a
couple of
freezing zones
um
staking is offered constantly
and
also for participation at the launch pad
you have to have certain number of
tokens
uh the highest number of tokens uh
the better opportunities are for weight
for being white listed or to be accepted
for the launch pad on a certain
condition
um
currently we also opened the farming
together with everscale
in the pair of every scale and income
token
and
it's about
right now it's not
it just started so it's about 100
annual
income so just so we want to go and take
a child
okay great um
olga as the community gets to know you
and the infam platform a bit better
because i imagine some people especially
those watching it right now are probably
looking at the website and the launchpad
platform
um
it's a good opportunity um
for you to tell us what you think and
feel the pros and cons are if any
um by everscale pursuing a partnership
with you
let's start
with the pros
okay um it's easier to find
um first of all um infam is a unique
platform of its kind
um there are many uh very many you know
attempts to do something like
but um
i don't know any successful really um
good uh deeply um structured projects uh
uh because we
managed to
combine not only the verification by
blockchain
but also the verification by collecting
the information about the people
about the project by making them um data
subscription mode um
give us more attention it's not like we
just come in and register the platform
really know the people really know
we have all kinds that um
i'm sorry
i'm very sorry because somebody's
boarded by by the sport i'm also wounded
by
it's blowing up
the disco is very popular
yeah i'm sorry sorry no problem
okay
[Music]
um and i apologize to everyone who was
bored
including myself
um
okay
um the our platform is structured and
it's uh uh
mentored the way that we really are
responsible for what we're giving for
the uh
information about the influences for the
information about the ambassadors and we
gave gave uh inside the platform all the
possibilities for the people to
independently reach to each other and to
solve their own
orders and agreements between themselves
financially we don't intervene into that
but we do provide the dispute resolution
or we do
give all uh
[Music]
old infamy we do
um
put all information about what people
were agreeing about on the blockchain uh
this is really a service
that
fully describes how
clean
and clear we want to be
for hours
for our participants in the platform i
think that's why um
everscale
should have selected us in the first
place in the indeed because we do um
we do um
make uh everyone who works with us uh
verified we indeed show the real uh
materials the real number of users the
real number of likes the real number of
followers
uh and the same with the projects we
deeply uh go into to study the projects
we meet with the people we talk to them
and this is very important i think
for the filter and not just go around
and select all the pro the project that
we know
from the market yeah i admire the
transparency
yeah well thank you
thank you that's the idea the general
idea behind it
and it saves people money it saves
people time it saves people nerves so
these are our three accord
i think people would appreciate that
yeah yeah i'm happy myself because i
also have several projects and uh
finding the right person
or the right project is initiative in
the market
yeah okay thank you very much for
sharing all that let's see if we have
any questions from the everscale
community chat
or on youtube i think we do have a
couple
um
one community member has asked what
value
it will bring to everscale
you have touched on
many points so far but maybe you could
briefly
uh summarize about the value
as i said uh we are a good um
very good strategic partner in uh
finding nurturing filtering and
accelerating the projects uh bringing
more investors also from our own
platform to look at the ever scale
projects and at the ever scale as a
blockchain
um
and
influencers also
and the messages could be found here on
our platform for the ever scale projects
um
basically
i guess it's the same that i said
already
yep
yeah i think just watch over the whole
ama
you you've explained a lot
uh another question is interesting are
there any bonuses for the ever community
maybe a bonus such an interesting way
yeah that's an interesting question or
we could decide on that
let me take it uh let me think my theme
on that maybe we can come up with
something very interesting
uh if there are any suggestions what
kind of bonuses are interesting for the
community we're happy to know please let
us know
yep and tagging right on with that um
also a similar question but even more
interesting is do you have a referral
system
um
we have referral system
i'm not particularly
sure i can speak about the detail
the details of that but um if you ping
me personally i will answer that a
little later
would you come okay
okay perfect
thank you very much olga for sharing all
this information with us and sharing us
with us in fam and
the whole project that you are working
on it is definitely very interesting and
i'm sure that the community will have
more questions in the coming days as it
sits in so i'll be sure that i bring it
to you but of course you are always
warmly welcome to join the everscale
community chat so you can discuss with
everybody directly
sure i hope we will have more yeah we
will have more topics now working
together with our scale yes so bring
them to the public together yeah
thank you really appreciation yeah
well it was a pleasure meeting you um
and with that said i think we're done
here thank you again olga for your time
and everscale peeps um we'll see you in
the chat
so good night everybody
bye bye
bye
