i'm already have account
i would say this is an exclusive preview
as we haven't been showing this to
anybody else yet
preview because it's the first time when
we show anyone our mvp
and when you authorize by meta mask
you just you do it in a browser no need
to install something you just play
click play and
welcome
i hope
thanks to the balinese fast internet
connection there's always some kind of
issues of his connectivity up here
yes but
bali internet's really
really serious and
okay i'll try to reload
okay guys maybe we can show it future
let's go further
okay
uh no problem during his uh he's
connecting i will tell about bulletin
was born
14th of april
on the island of god's bali i met a
wonderful person mr poor hondokun and
found out that we're having the same
dreams
the dream is to build a virtual with
virtual world through which we can
interact with the real one convenient
through all features of culture history
and architecture so
oh here it's working yes yeah it's
working in browser
it's almost uh two frames per second now
but uh actually yeah
it's really fast working thing uh that
you can uh turn on using your
like even an ipad
uh the servers these servers are in
singapore that means that the signal
goes to ipod on bali and transferring to
youtube and without delay with with some
delay but it's a um it's a game you're
interacting with this
switch
oh yes yes i will show another another
time
i see a very very very slow connection
now
here it's changing
time of the day
okay guys maybe uh we should show the
presentation uh later okay
okay
danielle please continue please continue
and
so
that people from all over the world have
the opportunity to visit and understand
this place for the uh from their screens
from any device of their um
before that um before that we built uh
the largest uh before uh we built the
largest digital city in the world
toronto it was
it was our previous pro uh project
that's how uh we built the team and this
application first um it was based on
unique technology for converting
engineering to topographic data into a
game engine we have
we have converted 73 skyscrapers uh to
build uh to build them just one fourth
part of this city
um
you can go into each house
explore all the apartments from any
device as if you were there
that's how we met with mr with mr prover
and started this project
uh early april this year
but
metaverse can be more than a marketplace
for brands or nft assets you can make a
masterpiece in game industry without a
strong club therefore bali twin will
entertain games
within story lines based on bali's
culture players will explore their
island in a futuristic segment solve
different moral demands and interact
with the real one with one another to
help defeat the ancient evil
sorry ancient evil
our team hopes that our project will
give some food for thoughts for every
player
so for every player
the trend this is the trend that we wish
to spread out in the blockchain gaming
industry
hey mr porvoir then the question is for
you why did you join bullet twin project
and how did you learn about it
uh well uh i need to be very
honest with your body here
uh
because in bali uh
uh we need uh we need to be very honest
with you
to everybody's
actually i was trapped that i was i was
framed by by danila
in bali twins so now i
move it you know
i was i was living jakarta for quite
some time so i decided to move to bali
and bring and
bring
my family to believe
to enjoy life the assistant of the
minister of defense before it's a very
boring
and then little bit scary jobs
related to the event
i decided to move to
enjoy your life but uh unfortunately i
met daniela and then we exchanged the
about
[Music]
i think we lost mr corbett due to the
bad connection sorry about this
but yeah vanilla came with an offer
which mr corvo couldn't decline and he
joined our team
i know
that's how internet and body works
actually i'm sorry guys
so here with us
further because our audience
are really
ready to enjoy the information that we
came yeah maybe we can uh you you guys
can answer the other questions and we
can give the time we will continue with
the uh with the presentation of our
companies if you don't mind so
the next
uh the next question will be for you uh
tell us about our the mission and goals
of bali twin
glad to tell about this bali twin is the
first ever project which will uh which
will be healthy tied to real territories
alongside usually gamify are achieved uh
there will
there will be a real property from real
bali landowners represented inside the
metabours jews helping the island to
develop and merge the border between the
real world and the virtual one
um
maybe
maybe i can help you uh just to explain
everything and clarify that all the
information like put it in a
big uh like
uh big ball of the information i mean
okay guys hello everyone like uh as uh
my teammates already said my name is
boogie uh and from this point of time
i'm your new favorite creative director
i'm just kidding uh and
i'm
i'm sure most of you don't really
understand uh what the body tween is so
let me make this information clear and
transparent
bali tween is a large-scale
decentralized video game
and it is a platform in a futuristic
setting built on blockchain and inspired
by uh cultural heritage of bali so this
is that's that's simple
and this project it's based on advanced
it's uh on an advanced cloud-based
technology so we're rendering everything
on the amazon servers and you just
receive a
video that you can
use on your any device you know on a
ipad so
it's allow you to explore a vast open
world and
buy and sell real land
real estate and even art objects
using
our in-game tokens
and
also
whoa
i'm sorry
just sharing some some sort of stuff
okay i will show it later uh
dude don't mind okay um
so uh what are we going to uh
give you uh as a player uh
we
uh
we'll give you an exciting plot driving
campaign used uh you can use a
personalized character i mean avatar
and enjoy a photorealistic new
generation graphics from any computer
and smartphone
and um
it's quite ambitious exciting and very
complex project
with four crucial components
uh first of all it is a plot driving mmo
rpg multiple
massive role-playing game
in the open world of the body of the
future
uh and it is um not another
project uh in the bland gamer i statics
of cyberpunk you know uh no uh we're
creating an entirely new setting uh it's
an utopian future where society
drives and enjoys a beautiful world full
of technological innovation and living
in harmony
with the nature
uh so uh we're we're going to provide a
full-fledged single player story
campaign um maybe this cinematics uh
it's going to be interesting cinematics
with the cutscenes
some kind of
incredible tv series you know within the
game
and
we will provide a
lot of variations of the plot and
multiple endings
in terms of storytelling
also
also our projects is about nfc and we're
creating an nfc marketplace for creators
architects and real estate
agents uh
we have developed our own um
online marketplace where users will be
able to purchase digital copies of art
pieces
real estate uh and even the
the real lands
and one of our goal is to improve
financial and
investment climate on this island
uh
we want
[Music]
we want to provide the opportunities for
indigenous people to earn money using
whoa i'm sorry using the new
technologies
um
and bulletpring as a platform will allow
art owners
earn
by selling their goods
not only
not on only on physical world but in
metaverse also
and also we create some kind of
cadastral online service of all existing
land and real estate and body uh
cadastral uh
all this information
will show you banya our architect a bit
later but um i will explain everything
briefly
in cooperation with the government of
indonesia we're creating a pilot project
uh
to
we're trying to develop the online
registry of all lands and real estates
on the island
which will be embedded in our members
and the the last
four thing uh
that i want to
not ask like uh
right now uh we're creating uh the
educational platform with our 3d library
uh of cultural and historical objects of
the island
uh
just imagine uh
unique
beautiful outstanding
culture of bali is slowly disappearing
it's dissolving because of globalization
because uh on the other part of
indonesia are
actually indonesia is a
largest muslim country in the world and
uh the bali is some kind of state within
a state
yeah i mean
it's different culture with a rich
folklore with different religion uh it
contains elements of enemies and
a lot of strange and uh inspiring
creatures spirits gods all that stuff
uh and mythology
and
not many people around the world knows
about it
even in the nation
so
right here let me show you uh um
uh show my screen i'm stop i'm stop
smashing whatever you can share my
screen
okay uh
just check this out
um
our project mission ah by the way here's
a few examples uh like what is about it
mean and
right now we're digitizing the real
landscapes uh
this one
on the left side is a
real uh river uh in the center of the
island and this is uh in game our
graphics like just just enjoy it
it's
some sort of comparison
okay um
here's the example it is a mask
it's an ordinary
uh
mask maybe
but
here is
the original
so
this beautiful art piece we digitalized
and put in our meadows as an asset
uh
and uh we're trying to scan all these
assets around the island
to save it for the next generations uh
to educate people around the globe to
explain and share this beautiful culture
for other people so we're trying to
preserve a cultural heritage of bali
because
a lot of things a lot of ours just
slowly disappearing
and we think it's really interesting
because
it's something completely new for the
outcomers
because it's uh
really it's different from other parts
of the world and let me explain let me
show you a few more examples uh that's
how we just saved the
assets we're using technology called
photogrammetry uh and uh
uh we saved the statues uh this thing
you can buy in our nfc market and
put on your
house territory inside the game
and also uh it is tell the story actual
story it is a hanuman it's a
famous a local um
character
uh and we
tell different stories about this uh
beautiful monkey
and um
here's another
character called varapala it is uh a
temple guard actually it's a house guard
uh
it saves uh a house against like uh any
ancient evil and etc so we just kind of
not just scanning statues we also
scanning
real temples uh ancient caves uh
the huge territory and we wanted to
share it to the world we wanted to share
it for the next generations
uh
and uh we want to
like just share it with with the world
and by the way yeah this um
whoa whoa something went wrong
that's why i love
conversation via
messengers
this creature called
naga
in henry's mythology uh it is uh uh half
um
human health for snake beings uh but not
here in bali because on body uh it is a
um it is a snake actual snake
and it is magical snake uh
even it's some kind of dragon you know
and
uh
here's a few example of how our in-game
graphics looks like
we're trying to achieve the maximum
quality of utilization and
provide players a
[Music]
high-end triple a gaming experience
yeah
next thing uh
we'll show one yeah i'm just trying to
say
bali
is worth to say
and because of the fact
i show it on our russian conversation
this sword called pre-sword
and as you can see
it's curved and it's totally different
from the swords from other parts of the
worlds uh it looks like a snake
with a beautiful platter underneath
and in
traditional european culture we hold the
swords
like this you know but not here in bali
not here in indonesia because they hold
swords like this
it's totally different and that's why
it's really interesting and we wanted
to share and save
uh and provide it to the audience around
the world
uh that's our uh
goal main goal actually one of the main
goal of our crew
uh and uh
let me pass
my word to
the next uh
teammate uh vania
just explain everything please explain
everything about our pedestrian things
because nobody knows uh what is actual
cadastr
means
um
okay
let me share the screen
um actually with cadastral we we'll come
to it
uh but first like um uh like as we
mentioned that
our game uh
takes place in uh in the near future
uh but in fact bali has
a lots of mysteries in the presence like
being just one
rather small piece of land
uh one of the southlands of indonesia's
island bali is a real magnet for people
from all over the globe
and this only this is is a purposeful
study actually a reason to to know it
better
um and
so
that's what we did probably uh we did
like an extensive uh mapping exercise to
understand the island
we looked at demography at settlements
of density at
natural layers
water
supply that's all the things that get us
familiar with the islands uh with the
territory we work with
and uh so that helped us build a
methodology
for our work um in foreseeing uh future
development of the island so um
we uh kind of take existing situation
uh we survey it create a full digital
copy of the islands uh then we come up
with a like a set of rules and
guidelines that really slash our vision
of
future uh development
and then since we have a metaverse we
can uh
we can um
to test this hypothesis and uh if if if
some of these
regulations prove useful
um this could be
a real regulation that can be used by uh
urban planning uh um
uh
authorities and uh uh and uh as policy
guidelines so we're creating like a
public good here
um
a paradigm that we uh we think then uh
thinking about the future is
post-urbanism
um
it hasn't been uh really like defined uh
so we have a little like of academic uh
value here
and uh in simple words what is first of
all urbanism is a world that reflects
the uh uh deurbanization trend when uh
like in the near future people will be
able to to escape
dance settlements without losing their
comfort because
everything you might need like food work
uh education health care could be either
remote
or can be delivered so um
and uh and bali is a very good uh
a very good case to study uh this trend
because bali has never been uh much uh
urbanized that's the way we now live
on the island we we live on the villas
in a jungle we work in the studio which
is also somewhere in the jungle but we
do not feel um anywhere remote because
uh as vancouver's put it
when there is no center there is no
periphery so we don't feel
like a periphery and for this um
post-urban world uh we're trying to come
up with a new quality of developing
and uh for this we're trying to foresee
what shape will the architecture and the
future take and what values it will
reflect
uh we extensively study our vernacular
uh objects of our architecture and
spatial objects of the islands creating
libraries from these studies like
elaborate libraries of elements of of uh
visions and senses that we can further
inject into some fundamental
uh typologies uh that we also kind of
categorize and uh um then try to use um
in our planning
um we study road structure uh to come up
with idea of
public transport of the future which is
suitable for the islands and
make conclusions on
how it can uh
how it can
influence streetscape design
we study irrigation system to understand
what role the water
will
play in a
in future layout
and urban realm
and
[Music]
one important thing we do uh what else
uh we mentioned is that we collect uh
information on property structure and we
organize it in in a cadastral portal uh
in simple words it's a user-friendly
land database uh that brings in
transparency uh to land in real estate
market
for investors and uh into land
management for the government uh so
we keep all the state the possible
stakeholders informed
uh what is um important like
especially important when some of these
stakeholders decide to relocate to the
islands and nowadays we see lots of uh
like companies teams um relocating and
there is a
like uh deficit of a suitable property
to serve the needs of these communities
because they are like really special uh
sophisticated needs and uh we now are
developing like uh models and like real
master plans for uh the first hub that
could accommodate such uh projects
um and um so this is like a
conditional zoning of
our pilot area and who knows maybe in um
in years to come some
uh people listening would live they're
with us probably um
yeah i'll stop sharing now um that's it
for architecture part small sneak peek
uh now daniel i will
talk about the financial things
um all those digital assets uh will be
um
you you you can buy using our future
talking uh bali talking
that's that's what we're together
working with uh mr pura to make it
possible right now
actually this month we're launching
marketplace uh and next month we you can
already use our talking to end of next
month you can use already our talking to
by everything that we're talking about
information digital copies uh
everything
mr can you please introduce how it's how
it can be possible using our resources
uh supporting resources
uh switch on your micro microphone
yeah your music mutants sorry this is my
first time in amma
i'm old
fashioned guys actually you know
um well honestly
uh
bali twin team led by
danila are very fast
on developments
so if they are
uh
working i need to be running and if
they're running i need to be flying
but if they fly i don't know how to
catch them
so i'm starting to
uh
collect the government support
for that
that gentlemen
we got
a support from the
local communities valley local
communities that
appointed by the governor of bali to
you know to
uh to manage
at
traditional villages in bali you know
across bali
so now uh they are free to do scannings
and
and whatever they want
um and then after that
we are cooperating with the
cultural universities in the pasar
valley
why this is very important because in
order to
feeding the right information about the
culture about the art about the
everything's about valley
because you know in valley twin
it must be correct all the information
must be correct
all the information must be
uh must be a hundred percent
resistance
so
uh
we are uh we are engaging with uh with
the universities of culture in bali
also
we got
we just got a support last week with the
investments and government relations
consultant from jakarta
names pina creative uh been a creative
actually
a company who was
initiated by the former minister of
finance of indonesia
so they with us right now and then
also
uh without uh
asking uh
danny levitt asking me
uh we got uh
we we approached to the three ministers
uh
and then uh you know uh the minister of
tourism and uh creative economist of
indonesia
uh
which is also friend of mine and then
the minister of trade
why minister of trade because
uh all about the nft about the token
about the
what you called um
uh
uh what is uh nfc tokens or or crypto
actually goes to the uh minister of
trade
so it is very important and then another
one ministers that will be enforced
actually the minister of
telecommunications
as you know uh in the beginning i was
disappeared and stuck because of the
internet connections
so i trying to i'm pushing the
government
to give the ballet twin or the whole
valley uh on the treat on not 4gb but 5g
connections
and uh they agree with that you know
and then
uh at least
but not last
uh
the um
you know the idea of of danila and the
team
are making a digital hub in valley
because many uh uh
many organizations or companies from
around the world would like to
base our station in bali you know bali
is a very beautiful
island
so
uh
in the near futures
we will have a
digital hub
that is why
many people from jakarta
are very
you know very
interesting on
on monitoring
thank you so much
um money we're using funding to scan the
islands um and instant relics uh funding
will go to support local indonesian
community in the form of salaries and
providing them with the technologies to
scan
it will create more job opportunities
people this island is loft all over the
world because of the history and culture
uh therefore the sale of the of the land
goes hard
hand in hand with a
residential of the local environment
if somebody wants to test
the game it's already working on our
portal
you can
message us uh in telegram and support
and we will give you access and if
you're somewhere else not on bali you
can visit this place first location
already now
um
exactly how it is uh that's what you
zuko
showed uh before
um
let's uh let's go to questions
yeah i think our community will be happy
to to get access to your game
i will be glad to share among our chats
uh in discord on telegram
and let's move on uh to the questions
from youtube there are a few questions
from
community members
uh first question is uh will holidays
and traditional traditions of real
valley be integrated on by the twin uh
metaverse uh
and are you going to create famous
ballet people
or gods
uh she and
vishnu as uh npc uh in metaverse
uh we will integrate in our
all important
persons in bali culture
and
we
collect
make the same time flow and the weather
floor when at bali
will knight in game will knight too
okay uh can i take a word just
yeah for sure uh we will uh
implement uh all
unnecessary holidays uh and uh
everything inside our game as a game
events so uh uh
it will be represented in game for sure
and also about the folklore the gods and
all that stuff
like uh i know that for generations uh
the banini's created original artistic
style
and created fascinating legends uh
stories about brave heroes
like
strange creatures and all that stuff
and uh
we want to
bring this all in our game and share it
to the world
i'm pretty sure that
we need to give the players a fresh
experience uh and a lot of positive
emotions
and
a local culture can provide it
for sure
that's why we want to put all the gods
and all the creatures inside our
storyline
and
actually right now we are working on the
three words
worlds i mean
inside the game uh the
world of the future
where where the actual game is uh the
world of the spirits where you can
find the strange creatures and
connect to the spirits and also that
stuff and uh
the historical part the world of the
past uh and during this storyline uh the
our
single-player campaign um
you can
time travel to the past
and learn history meet uh
ancient gods
and maybe ancient evil and for
save the world of the future uh in the
past
so
uh about the
gods uh
i think uh that
they will be represented in game uh but
um as non-playable characters
yeah i think uh it is an answer for the
question yeah i think that's full answer
uh
there's another question uh why has
everscale damped from outside is there
any marketing planet in the
near future
i think that's it's maybe not related to
the same way
okay
um
yeah it's a
strange thing too yeah uh the next
question is
as your
amazing game yeah is it that centralized
uh do you plan test and minute rewards
for node holders
or any early
supporters bonuses
uh yeah but definitely we will uh give
an access for uh early birds uh for
ours so like the guys who support us at
the start and right now we're creating a
marketplace where we can
share the first drop of
ancient nft masks actually we scanned a
lot of uh
ancient masks
and this mask you can buy
and
some of them will give you an access uh
to the
early uh gameplay moments
and uh probably it gives you an
opportunity to get some perks in actual
game
so um
like
after a few weeks
you can visit our marketplace and uh
get an instant access to our game
community and probably
an access to the game uh
in the future uh in the first class you
know
sorry guys for the interruption uh
dear
users please put your social media
accounts next to the questions so that
we could find you and give you the nft
in case if you want
just a quick reminder sorry roman
yeah uh no worse i've got a few
questions uh in them uh from the
uh our community members uh there
another question is um
uh how to get access to your marketplace
and buy nft items
it will be lunch just wait until next
week
yeah it will be launched next week
it will be on valleytwin.com
just join us and by directly using um
your um body twin wallet
yeah that's easy that's pretty easy
uh and we're metamask
and also guys uh just be prepared uh for
a huge open world equal of
5718 square kilometers but in the future
actually thanks to the
pixel streaming technology that we use
in our game we can
share
the new
game territories as we uh produce it
while a development process so we will
put uh the new territories uh step by
step uh and uh
uh you can play uh
on the first uh
um lamppost so like right now we're just
uh um scanning the ancient temple uh and
probably in the next month you can
run and uh explore this beautiful place
uh
and if you buy our nft we will give you
an access earlybird access for sure yeah
advertisement moment advertising moment
yeah there's one more question about the
tokenomics could you tell more about the
tokenomics
economics
my computer
zoom already shut down i don't know why
economics i just show you uh like a
while uh
zuka is um like
uh fixing uh his internet the connection
all the stuff uh here's our bodytalking
uh it is a an actual design or i'm sorry
tokyo makes bam bam bam uh it is our
uh body token uh we will uh uh give an
access
uh
like uh on this
cryptocurrency
uh in the future uh not right now
because uh
it's still on uh phase of development
process uh and about the tokyomix
zuka are you ready
can you share a few slides of
presentation
for sure which economics will make a
revolution there the pilot token has
utility functions some of which were
previously descripted by
frames for daniela i want to focus your
attention on some aspects like later the
reverse and sticking system in
everything is simple with the first one
and would you like to tell a little more
about taking in additional to the
classic mechanism which is the token get
the token our project will have a new
game file type which in aptel and
staking it's when the user need to
collect a certain pool of properties
such as nft land building of course a
real temple
but most importantly to make it work to
help make daily offerings the spirit in
the form of a special game item just
like the locals have been doing it
hundreds maybe thousands of years in
bali but uh let's not go to details
let's somewhat important point why do we
need
ever scale partnership

so if you see the link uh in our in a
chat
window please follow and follow us on
our social networks
again all the news first
yes there is one more question uh
regarding the game now maybe the last
one uh sorry
uh sorry uh i i was shocked that uh
my colleagues the minister of
foreign malaysia are watching our
youtube
just for your information
yes
yes sorry continues
sounds great
good news
in a great conversation okay uh i'm
sorry rahman for interruption
uh the last question from uh
uh from the community member uh is there
a flight option uh in the game uh uh
planet
uh
some kind of
para glider
or a glider yeah
uh it's funny question uh i i i don't
think so uh right now because uh uh
there is a lot of things to implement in
game in terms of uh
game playing mechanics uh we're playing
to create a lot of minigames with
economics and even a gambling system i
mean uh let me show you the
uh show already
uh funny things
uh here's an example it is a i mean
rooster uh and uh right now we're
creating a short minigame uh now that
all you users to grow up uh and uh buy
and sell uh the actual
 uh and i like it uh compete in a
uh and i like it uh compete in a
 fights
fights
and uh let me show you a few examples uh
so uh we don't want to implement
paragliding at start because we got a
lot of ideas how to
uh
how to provide the joy for our players
and for example
you can
grow your personal
put the vr glasses
on his head and right after that
you'll be able to
fight on arena
using your virtual
as a
ar representation like it's some kind of
uh
uh we are fighting in a game it's like a
game in a game and we're creating a lot
of
that type of
mini games
and
if we're talking about like this type of
game uh gog fighting uh
right now uh this tradition it's a
traditional thing in bali
and it is restricted by the government
uh so everybody um uh
going to the cockfights outside of the
city's areas uh because it's no no no no
sorry it's not restricted it's a it's a
law if the cultural
contest ah seriously
yes yes
as i read before uh is out of the law in
some areas
no no no if it cultural contents it's
allowed because it's pre-surfing the
cultural but
with the digital things
we they will be very happy to to uh to
preserve digital needs sorry yeah uh
thank you for all my comments
so that's how it be represented in the
game we will create some kind of big
huge stadiums areas uh where a lot of
players can
watch on the cockfights
at the same time
so you can
grow
tune
and
fight using your
fighting
so
about
coming back to the park lighting um in
the future we want to give the
opportunities for the gamers to create
the short mini games inside the game by
themselves uh but uh uh it uh won't be
uh
available on the start of the game uh
because
we want to
provide the
beautiful user experience without any
lag
any
and we want to provide the
best user experience to our gamers so we
will start with
our game mechanics first but if you want
to put something in our game and uh if
you will
subscribe in our
social networks if you follow us if you
give us the ur ideas maybe we can
implement it in the future
cool yeah
looks cool
that was the last question uh so uh
i just want to say that
at this point we can uh finish our mma
session uh
just want to say uh thank you all that
you came
and
show our community uh
show that our community
about the ability
i already got a few requests
to the early access
we'll be glad to touch them to connect
them with you
uh so guys maybe do you want to say
something for our community
uh yeah for sure guys
i want to assure you that uh
bullet bean isn't a play to win project
it's not like new uh mobile version of
diablo where you can pay all of your
money just to continue playing uh no no
for sure uh
in our universe it's not necessary to
spend money to compete a blood driving
campaign
uh our level up your character
we believe that play to earn should be
equal to play for fun
so we uh
we are working on a new business model
uh that will allow companies to develop
delighting like delighting users with
new updates and avoiding
uh
and avoiding
uh the best stuff you know like uh
you can
see on the new diablo title
so
um
that's it that's it maybe i
i sell it all
thank you
cool
