oh
hello hi everyone
pavel and alex
hi
hello
so i guess we have about six speakers
one two three four six
i think everybody's here
no waiting for vlad
alex
you look quite serious
as if you're trying to solve the
blockchain trilemma right now
yeah you're really dark you're like
running
yeah
serial killer pop up behind you
so waiting for massive
well i guess we can certainly i mean
most of the people are on call yeah
waiting for one win for vlad mazlakov
okay
yep
okay
yep we could start actually it's gonna
be
uh
a lot of stuff to cover so hi everybody
and welcome to a very special ever scale
community call we have with us today
some of the top technical minds leading
development for the everscale network
and just a reminder that 1 000 evers are
up for grabs for the best 10 questions
and it's not too late to participate
just be sure to
uh write your question with the hashtag
evascal and just underscore dev
underscore meeting so we can find your
questions
and since we have a lot to cover today
because we also have another ama uh with
roxas everex and d5 alliance in one hour
let's just get started right away kick
it off with our first speaker and that
is mr
pavel pigolovko with the serial killer
in the background
he's going to be giving us an
introduction to the network development
organization
so pablo
yes hi everyone
it's nice that you joined
us uh tonight or today
depends on what what what place of the
earth you are
now
so um i think there were many questions
in the community regarding what's going
on with core development and
what
happened what changes we had with us
because we
had
a mixture on any calls before and now
nietzsche is more focused on
uh
gauche as you probably uh know
so i would like to start from
exploration what is going on inside
everyx
and
we performed we actually developed a lot
of stuff which hopefully
we use as users or
developers or
other community members
so
finally we come at the point where
we have now
uh
a number of very
important projects
and each project now has a dedicated
development team and each team has its
own team lead
so when
the robot was formed and that later on
there was uh one man
again as you know who was uh responsible
for all
uh
uh design this was
all product design
decisions
and
uh
it worked
somehow in the beginning and actually it
works well so we delivered another
delivery
wanted to deliver other very important
products like sdk compilers
but
it is impossible for a single person to
manage
efficiently
all
those streams
so finally we made internal decision to
make
each project
as a
fully fledged separate team which
focused only
on that project with the lead with the
team
for each project
so what we can now we have now ever
known
the most
probably probably the most important
company because
the network itself then we have uh
a sdk
slash cloud uh infrastructure which
which is called uh evernote platform
[Music]
so
then we have
compilers
your famous compiler
again probably some of you
use
so those those are three uh core
streams which everything's
[Music]
doing
each
team
uh
needs of
[Music]
before
but they're not
[Music]
so they have separate streams and they
could have
okay that's it pavel thank you very much
uh for the overview i'm sure we're going
to learn a bit more um
with the other teams in the following
ama and
after a few more announcements and down
the line thank you and when we have some
questions
please uh stick around so i'm sure that
there are some specifically for you
and so we will move around move on to
the
second speaker and that's lava blanco he
is the team lead of evernote is just
mentioned by pavel and he's going to
give us some node development highlights
so
slava
if you could please turn your camera on
that would be great too
can you can you hear me yes
it's a little loud where you are
would it be possible to kind of go into
a quieter corner
uh yeah basically behind the
team meaning our team
basically uh
we
have to follow
different ways of
some kind of
different ways of thinking so we have to
develop
and at the same time we have to
listen for community
for
some kind of
ideas and many complaints about
about the network so
can you hear me okay
yeah yes i can hear you
that's good
so uh we
are going to
and actually we do
some combining of our internal plans and
some ideas from community to get some
straight directions
to the future and to
get a good product
in the end of
our road
so
that is our common understanding how we
should
how we should do
okay do you have anything else you'd
want to share or maybe pavel wants to
jump in here
yeah i think uh you can you can just
briefly
explain what streams uh you have
internally in the team uh regarding smft
concerns about ramp uh
and so like
so
inside the team there are a number of uh
very important projects which are going
on
so later on there will be a presentation
of an architectural committee and the
process what
which was already set up so not team as
well as other teams for teams they work
or they work
following
communities needs it's not like
we do it
as internal process now because it's
fully transparent
we have uh k members who
also provide a lot of input uh for
directions where we should go
and what should we do so
if you
a little bit uh
disclosed
uh what are you working now
yeah yeah of course so
basically last last times we discussed
this community about some items that is
really interested for the uh
to move our blockchain towards to the
future so we found some cases like
multiple work chains and some
[Music]
other items like
drive chain functionality to
store the
[Music]
files
using the blockchain
blockchain mechanisms actually
so
we had several meetings with community
guys and
set up
setup activity with a team
to prepare some good plans
for
to
to achieve
some reasonable results within
reasonable time
uh with some steps that can be
monitoring with uh with the help of
community so we'll prepare a plan
and we'll review this community guys and
then we can
follow the development steps
so exactly the topics that we should
follow with the
multiple chain items the drive chain and
the
slashing mechanisms
inside the work chain or sorry inside
the blockchain
so
i think that we had a lot of a lot of a
lot of questions to discuss but maybe
this video is the most important thing
yeah let me
file a little bit
so slavo was talking that about
the fact that those priorities like
blockchains and flashing they were set
up by a community
uh we had our
own agenda as you know we are
not not team focused on delivering uh
features uh what were mentioned in white
paper which
is probably already almost a year from
now
was published
uh
but uh community
members of the skill community uh on
architectural committee
uh said that okay we need this and these
features uh delivered a sub
so some features were
got less priority and those features
which
as well mentioned they got highest
priority
so
as as of now
there are two
most
wanted uh features uh
multiple watch support multiple chains
and uh which by the way includes uh
messaging between world chains as well
and uh another feature is slashing for
validators which you can perform their
digits
other
uh
bottoms actually there's nothing
always important in
roadmap
you cannot say that
some part of that roadmap is not
important
but
it is
implementation uh and go into production
it will be in stages
uh so
uh
ram ram which long
long time weighted ram uh it will be
uh
open source
as we discussed
this week
and it is
it did already for a couple of months in
tests
system can take some time and
quite honest unpredictable amount of
time to take so that's why
we decided not to
develop it in a hidden way because
we'd like to convince you also to
provide some opinion on that and
probably provide some help with finding
bugs so it will be uh open source by the
end of this week
so the same situation with the first
uh
part of smste
upgrade
those who should be available by the end
of this week
um
yeah
we have a fully capable team for deliver
all features
mentioned in the white paper
of course there should be some
implementation uh fluctuations in
implementation dependent fluctuations
but we are fully on track on what was
planned a year ago
okay great
thank you for elaborating
thank you very much and from here we're
going to move on to ekaterina pantas and
she is the team lead of evernote
platform and she'll be discussing the
platform and cloud development
highlights katarina
hello everyone
i
will i will share my screen now
uh
not sure exactly what to say
but
i will go along my presentation
okay i will tell you about the
development cycle of the evernote
platform team
uh which actually exists for
three years already and
uh nothing
changed that much so
at first we collect requirements
we have different sources uh to collect
requirements it's uh like
uh community telegram and
private messages with uh developers of
the community
and also we collect requirements from
our
partners
and projects we work with
such as serv life
flex broxus
and
so on
and
then we
validate this hypothesis that
users want
say sometimes someone wants to implement
some great feature that
they they're sure they're really great
and uh we do not take features in
development immediately we go and i go
and ask
developers if they need it or they don't
and many features were
rejected or trashed this way so
then
we prioritize
features
and
then we develop them
development is a process that itself
consists of many
um
phases that i will not
explain here
document release and collect
customer feedback
and do the next iteration so
this is
all about development cycle
i think i can use this opportunity to
tell you about the roadmap
of our products
uh evercloud now is going to release the
dashboard
together with reliable end points and
authorization support
in the dashboard you will be able to
register in the
and get your credentials to access the
api
and also um
we know about the problem about
balancing
among the
network endpoints because we didn't
provide uh
availability sla for each of them
um
now
and we understand that this is a problem
for users who do not
i use sdk to access api who wants to
work directly with api it's a problem to
implement balancing
and
we decided to
release this reliable endpoints and we
will balance on the backend on our site
and these endpoints will go
uh these endpoints users will receive
after the registration in the dashboard
and also
they will receive authorization
credentials
um there will be
ways to authorize with project id
with a basic authorization with secret
and
later we will add support for gbt tokens
and this authorization will become
mandatory by september 22 so in one
month and i think uh i hope we will
release dashboard this week
um
so
this is the like nearest
uh future
and also in parallel now we develop
token api
um the reason why we were not developing
it
didn't uh haven't started developing it
earlier
is because there was no standard for
tokens and
um
we wanted
the community to
standardize it so
now we have a standard but this standard
tip31 is also not
a complete standard actually we
implement api on top of
uh tip 3.2
which is not uh
accepted i think but
brooks has already
have its description in the github so
because tip31 is it covers only
transfers standardization not ownership
and stuff like that
so
we will release token api on top of tip
to
standard
uh
and then we will add project analytics
to
the dashboard
it will uh project analytics means the
api usage of the project so
uh projects will see uh what requests
they do how often uh how often they meet
limits and
stuff like that and later we will um
start calculating uh
query costs and based on that those
costs
we will add access limit policy
um
and
later we will when we do some analysis
based on api usage we will
introduce some subscription tiers and it
will be of course freemium model
so the free subscription
if you have low uh requests uh
lower number of requests you
may use free subscription and if you
have higher
number of requests of course you will
need to buy
a more
costly like subscription
and in terms of another
features that we plan to implement
its nft api
um
also because the standard was now in the
process of accept acceptance
um
so
this is it for ever cloud
uh priorities and roadmap and sdk
roadmap is shorter
we plan to
introduce based on the feedback of
developers we want to
duplicate upkid and introduce another
web3 like contract package
in some time i don't know maybe a couple
of months
um it will be like web 3 the js
libraries
so it will be more
convenient for developers to use
also the engine will be removed from
sdk it will be first duplicated now
um
because surf team wants to develop it uh
separately
and
also sdk
binary became pretty big so it's a good
idea to remove the engine from
from it
and later
i don't know when but we will
release sdk 2.0
and probably will make it more modular
because uh some users say that
having two megabytes binary with wasm in
the web is a problem
i personally think that's not a problem
because
the main
crypt
like products that use sdk are either
working extensions or in mobile or in
desktop or in the backend and
not very
often sdk is used in the web
like
you know on the in the page like itself
so
um
i'm not sure like maybe we will not do
it modular but maybe we will like we
continue this uh hypothesis
testing um
and here is the short road map for
uh se
we plan to
increase test execution time it has
already in
oh i mean decrease test execution time
of course uh we already decreased it two
times in the last version
tests around two times faster now but we
plan to decrease it more
uh hopefully to reach the same uh speed
as in ganache
um
and also
we will
introduce new features with
snapshot creation and revert
uh it was also required by
contract developers
well next thing i want to say
that we are now hiring and we need
front-end developers
for our dashboard
and we need qa
release engineer
and pipeline engineer and technical
writer or developers who can write
documentation so
because amount of work is in prison and
we need to grow our team
so if you
some of you want to join us
then
message me
and we will
appoint some interview
um
so
i think i will stop my sharing now
yeah so this is basically it thank you
great thank you very much for sharing a
presentation and also being uh very
transparent and how your team handles
the development cycle it's very
interesting um also the road maps maybe
we should have a dedicated presentation
an ama once the dashboard is ready
cool uh thank you katarina stick around
for any questions that might come your
way next up we have a boris ivanovsky
he's the team lead for tool
and he's going to give us some
highlights on the smart contract
developer toolkit
yeah hi there um
i've been doing this for three years by
now and
blockchains have been renamed repeatedly
and
uh
it has been rebranded
back and forth but as the strategy has
not changed
they are committed to
jail tools to
make blockchain a development platform
basically that's
something which
nobody had done before and
this is blockchain i believe it's it's
possible
we have released over 60 releases of
compiler
we
have not had any critical bugs
for the duration of the
deal clip
timeline and
we are going pretty fast
i believe
everybody on the school already knows it
so
if you have any questions
okay
we have pretty good news
from the open standpoint
second
okay sounds good uh short and sweet so
please stick around for us if there's
any questions that you might be able to
answer
thank you
um
next up on the andrenda we have uh
vladimir but i don't think he'd be he
was able to make it so we'll push him to
the end in case he comes up
uh so moving on let's go to the team
lead at broxas and that is sergey
pottekin and he's going to talk to us
about what broxas does for development
of the everscale network
yeah hi guys do you hear me well yes
yes so um let me start unfortunately i
don't have such a beautiful presentation
as a katarina so i'll just tell you
about few ongoing uh developments in the
bronxes
uh so uh let's begin uh first of all uh
as many of you know uh last week we have
released the new major version of the
lock lift framework
uh for those who
who are not familiar with it this is
basically the hard hat for every scale
which allows you to develop and test and
deploy your smart contracts on the every
scale network
it was
upgraded
you can see the release notes probably
on the github there are tons of new
features such as let's say tracing uh
visual debugging
uh and
many many more new configuration
typescript support
and
way more
so
also as you know uh we have uh placed
the hackathon last week in the belgrade
unfortunately i wasn't able to visit it
but as i know
it was amazing
and we have received tons of feedback
about this new version the developers
were happy we fixed some minor bugs so
uh all of you are welcome to join us to
use the lock lift it is completely open
source
uh
also uh
probably there will be a separate uh
release blog post uh in the boxes medium
so uh okay let's let's move on also
uh we have uh
pretty much finished the
new uh block explorer
you can find it on the beta ever scan
so basically it has
the functionality which the current
error scan has
and much more for example
uh i'm happy to
say that we are finally finished the
contracts verification
so um first of all right now you are you
are able to verify all your solidity
error scale smart contracts as i know
this one is dow root of the error scan
so as you see the
uh code is verified the api and so on
also you can use
this amazing feature such an executor
probably you're familiar with it if you
have ever used the etherscan you can
read the details directly from the
smart contract or you can send some
messages to the smart contract
extremely handy feature
uh
so uh yes
probably it will be released in a next
few weeks maybe maybe uh
earlier we still have to finish the
light theme and few
few minor bugs let's say
uh yes uh so uh this this will be a
replacement for the current everest con
uh block explorer uh also we have
released an amazing developer feature
which is called debugger as i know there
was no uh similar projects in the ever
scale
right now it is it can be found on the
ever btmio probably it will be uh
migrated to block explorer or some other
product i don't know uh we still have to
found out uh by using this you can
literally debug every single uh smart
contract transaction in the every scale
you can see
let's say the uh
all the op codes that were executed in
the action phase you can see this stack
on the right
so you know right now it is a lot easier
to debug your uh reverted transactions
if something went wrong uh maybe
it also will be implemented in a form of
i don't know uh
idea
extension or something
uh so yeah also feel free to test and
give us your feedback we really
appreciate it
another important thing uh that's as you
know the
uh on the last week there were a
performance test of the everscale
network and
many users ask us about how can they see
the stats
the current load the short stats and so
on so let me remind that
we are contributing to our public
monitoring error address dashboard
so you can see the
[Music]
like sharding stats the tps stat block
time elections and
so on
also
right now we are working
on the
everscale network
project
which is basically the implementation of
the uh
adl uh layer
uh and
this is kind of infrastructure project
you can use it on
i don't know every single uh
project you are working on so you can
implement yourself some kind of flight
note or the full node for every scale
process
is already using it in the ton indexer
project for example so as i know it is
already
working and it's been tested but uh
there are still some major issues which
uh
have to be uh fixed
uh so uh
probably uh
definitely i forgot to
uh i forgot about something or and i
don't have that much time so if you have
any questions ask me or feel free to
join our next broxas mea session
thank you
great thank you very much sergey uh it's
very interesting and for sure elysium
was definitely an excellent initiative
by roxas so thank you for sharing all
that and the dashboard as well please
stick around for any questions that
might come your way
and we were going to have uh vladimir
mazlakov a member of the architecture
committee who was going to talk about
the architecture committee
but i believe
he's on an important call and povel's
going to step in for him and just give
an overview so pablo
yeah
yeah yes do he well
yes
hello
okay great
so as i already mentioned
as i already mentioned
uh
since we already
migrated to rask node which was the
first major
kpi
and promised from
rx
clubs
we
now priorities uh dependent on business
and actually it should be
oldest
because
every scale
ecosystem
uh despite the fact that there are a
number of teams and they do their own
projects but at the end we are in a
competitive environment
so we should look around we should see
what's going on in
going on in other blockchains and
we should do as a community
business in a way
uh that
we should uh
try to get the best projects and uh to
get the most developers attention and
most developing team attention
so
that's why
there was a push strong push from
community from key members
to
create such mechanism where we
actually
assess what priorities should be
should be
done in first place and what
can we
at the end
that architecture
are formed and we
it consists uh actually it is a
semi-open
group of people because
we
it's not it's nothing to hide
from us uh
actually all developing should be open
source and clear for all our members
of the community
but of course if we invite everybody
from the street then we'll it will be
not possible to discuss quite complex
technical stuff
so that's why uh
that those meetings they are a little
bit limited
and participation they're
limited only to 2k members
of the network
uh as solano mentioned before
now priorities which were set up
by the
that committee
were focused uh on
work chains uh the lever of work chains
with messaging between them
and flashing for
validators
we assume that that committee will
be also the place to discuss not only
uh north development but also
development of some 4k
projects uh our network to
discuss some
some integration issues which you could
have
as
well
um
well
what else i could add
if you have any questions please
okay great thank you very much
sorry let me interrupt you i just forgot
to say that um boxes is also working on
an extremely long weighted task the
ethereum virtual machine compatible work
chain integration
um as you understand this is not an easy
task because there are so much uh
breaking changes uh in the node itself
in the protocol of course uh so uh
this task is still uh in kind of
research mode uh we're working on it uh
and so i hope there will be uh more news
uh like in the future
thank you
great thank you very much second
so let's move on to the q a section as a
reminder the 10 best questions will be
awarded a thousand evers split between
you guys and they'll be selected after
the meeting so if you're a winner you'll
be contacted uh privately
so uh for the speakers um if you feel
that there's a question you can cover
please don't hesitate to just jump right
in
so
we've been collecting some questions
and the first one is from alexi and he
asks a question about storing data in
the blockchain
i've read about a storage fee to
maintain only the data that is needed in
this case what happens with transaction
history please explain
how
storing data works
perhaps the drive chain team
is also here
[Music]
sorry it is alex
hello
it was alexi
kobsitsky
is he ready to
listen to the answer
oh i'm sure he's watching watch me on
youtube
oh okay then uh so um
the thing is uh blockchain doesn't
actually store all the transactions
it still stores
hash codes
[Music]
of the transactions
to verify that they have
really taken place
all the history all the messages all the
previous account states uh are stored at
the validators and web servers
maintainers description
actually they could be gone in a very
short time
it's a matter of goodwill to maintain
such bases
the thing which makes it
precious that you have hash that proves
that
the chain has not been broken
but
the
account states and the history of the
transactions is a huge
bonus to the development and to the
actually using the blockchain
and
that's basically
how it works
i think the question is uh was not about
transactions itself but the question was
about
account
the fact is that uh all addresses in
every scale network
they
like they are smart contracts and they
have uh accountability
and uh
as it is designed from the very
beginning
uh when once you have not enough
balance of ever on on
that account and
account was triggered by some
transaction
then it could be freezing
it could become frozen
then it is changed for a cache of its
state
and that uh
substituted by
uh by special state and that mechanism
allows
for a user to restore
this that account
so from my perspective it is a great
mechanism because if you
uh of course if you don't care about
your accounts then why we should care as
a blockchain where we should store it
forever for free and once that account
becomes frozen you have time to reverse
things and
come and
upload back
your account
in a state
what uh it was before it was frozen
that's why uh hash is frozen to that
address uh that's why hash is stored
uh as a data for that address
so
from my personal view it is a great
mechanism
right well in
theory right it is but in practice you
remember uh
the amount of
pain we have
experienced by restoring one of the
first accounts
right it can be restored now
the tools have
options and command subcommands to help
you with restoring the accounts but
the device is not to
get it to the state
and to have a minimal amount of
minimal balance on the
account
to keep it
active
because
it's
not really a
delightful experience to
get your account unfrozen it can be done
but
it's not
really a vulcan park
it should not be often because if you
don't care about your account then why
why we'll chase it here
yeah yeah
of course
okay makes sense
uh like i say i hope that ans
answered your question uh moving on to a
question from victor lee uh
how to get into your ecosystem where is
massive marketing for everything like
game fi
excluding
poker um
i'm not quite sure if there's
uh
room to really address this question as
it's more of a developer focused
[Music]
yeah i think um you and this can be
taken into the ama session this is i
think more
more of a
question yeah sounds good okay so if
italy your question will be answered in
about 20 minutes um
okay next one
uh
for more widespread use it would be good
to establish bridges between ever and
fiat are there any plans in this
direction some kind of plastic cards
i think we do
have such solutions uh who would like to
jump in here
[Music]
for sure we have
but when we say
say about regions between fiat and
crypto it is not on blockchain level
it's done not only it's done on
application
and even even surf has it uh
so other applications also have it
uh and there's a section i think on the
website how to buy
uh everest how to buy other tokens
so this is quite standard
yep and i believe there are more
solutions right on the
in the roadmap too
um
okay moving on so currently social web 3
is being talked about a lot and several
new social web 3 projects are emerging
and most of them are in the evm network
will it be possible for everscale to
create a social web free project built
on the everscale ecosystem
i think there is such a project
i think it should be introduced
shortly
as far as i know
there are two projects one focused on uh
open email
so when everybody can connect to
uh
through sdk to
every scale and to use it as the email
transferring
weekend and
another
project is for open messaging
and for from my perspective
every scale has a perfect
architecture for exactly the
full-size solutions
because of its scalability
okay
thank you pavel
uh
todd asks
is anyone looking at developing dao's to
form a business other than govern
everscale tour company in serbia
restaurant somewhere wedding photography
and so on
uh it would be fun to use everest to
invest in something brick and mortar and
get dividends in ever very interesting
question
i think this is also joanna i think it's
a question to the team on the call
really maybe we could save that one also
okay
unless somebody wants to check it
yes i raised my hand i can briefly
comment about this that
uh as you know we present
uh some new project forever scale on
hackathon
and in this project we are planning to
integrate dao for holding tournaments um
it will be special tournaments
um dao for different roles uh tournament
associations uh game manufacturers
because it's game project gamers and so
on and we will integrate dao
actually as this
member ask about that's why yes
for example our project
uh planning to do it so that's it
thank you
thank you okay um so todd i know that
your answer was kind of uh your question
was kind of answered but um stick around
for the ama i'm sure we're going to dive
deeper into it and give some more
information there
um
and so we have another question dear
everscale devs i'm curious on how
everscales game 5 works does it have any
connections with the new concept metaphy
and p2e do you have any features
implemented to recognize metadata
um in the everscale blockchain network
and what is working what is the working
mechanism of metaverse sdk and features
of it
heavy question
um
yeah this is one of the years what uh
the fire land alliance actually
has uh that in order to grab
a business team
in some important areas uh we should we
can create a simple way
so a boring way by creating
sdk
for specific topic
so
atk for meta versus is also on
development and
i'm not sure
about status of it i don't have that
determination uh i think
some
somebody from the fire lines can
comment on that but i know that
definitely it is underdeveloped and it
is a good idea
to
help on board projects
yes thank you pablo
okay if nobody else wants to jump in
there we will move on
um
there is okay
next question there are currently about
200 validators in the network the
magister ludi program will end soon how
global governance plans to support and
expand the decentralization of the
network
this is actually one of the topics for
the upcoming ama session
that's uh
yeah
okay
uh alex number two uh
yeah eske
hof i cannot pronounce your name
correctly
um let's make some notes to carry these
questions over
um okay next moving on according to the
white paper emission of ever should be
stopped will this point be completed how
and when
yes this is almost not funny but this is
proposal number five that will be
present in the dma session in six
minutes
as you can sense it will be quite
important but the short answer is yes
one of the proposals that will be put up
on board and that everything is to stop
a mission and stop to instead come up
with a fund
uh with a fund to compensate validation
cool
okay
thank you alex uh bitcoin bridge schedu
scheduled for q4 2022 is everything
going according to plan will it be
integrated into octaves bridge or will
it be a separate solution like ada ever
roxas team
yeah yeah
let me um answer
uh so um
right now uh i can say
uh do we have plans uh about adding
bitcoin direct support i mean like
native support to the octus bridge
uh since uh there are ongoing
integration of the solana into the
actus bridge and there is a chance uh it
is still the research phase that uh
maybe we will uh
integrate the near blockchain
uh so uh
i'm not sure that uh it will be
integrated into the octus bridge
uh so um i don't know we'll see maybe
maybe someone else uh have something to
say
you know since uh if there will be the
business requests uh about the
integrating bitcoin because as you
understand this is extremely complex
task it is possible after all
uh but uh
you know it's like a huge task
so yeah well they can add to this um
just a couple of senses i know there was
a us-based team out of new york called
architect that was interested to explore
uh
the
bitcoin bridge was ever scaled
but i don't think it's in development
yet i think they're still kind of
talking to the technical team on the
on the you know architecture and specs
that's what i know but we might want to
double check i'm sure somebody in the
brooks team is also in the loop on the
discussion
okay we have time for one more question
and that's from ann fono
in evercloud api usage when some
projects loaded others may be affected
in some way an api may get degra
degraded
degradated
uh will there be an update for free to
use api in the future to get fast
response time without using dedicated
cloud deployment
um
yes
actually now uh in the cloud api we use
the same database for real-time data and
for analytics
requests and this is not right so we
plan uh
in the nearby future to move
collections queries
to a separate analytics database and
to
uh expand the existing
api uh that will allow to interact with
blockchain so users will have to migrate
to the new api
if they want to interact with the
blockchain it's called blockchain root
query
and if they want to perform some
analytics they will use collections
and
also when we will have authorization and
query cost calculation analytics queries
will post
more
so users will be able to make those
requests not that frequently so
this all will
lead to the better api response time
perfect thank you katarina so that
concludes our everscale bi-weekly meet
with all our special top speakers thank
you very much for coming and stick
around for the network reform ama with
proxis everex and the d5 alliance
starting in two minutes
thank you guys
bye
thanks bye bye
