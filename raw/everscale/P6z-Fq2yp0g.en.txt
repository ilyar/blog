to be honest i've been saying it that
bloody long oh come on
come on
hi there
hello alex how are we
ben i know you still watch frozen that's
your saturday night thing
oops i guess it's deadpool i think
deadpool because it's a barbara
streisand song originally i'm pretty
sure i don't know this is very random
yeah
maybe maybe i'm confused but it's not
exactly
relevant to the uh the everscale weekly
uh meetup so i'll scratch my chin on my
own time and texture
relevant everything's relevant
everything's relevant let's see people
are still coming in demetrius here
actually on camera wow
wow hey there here he comes to save the
day
hello our mighty mouse is here
uh alex you're on mute
are you talking to us
alex
maybe he's talking to somebody else
i'm only with you oh okay
oh you're muted we had no idea what
you're talking about
oh well
so
give a bit more time for people to
filter in
we had a bit of an issue with why why am
i the host now
you're cool i don't know
roman trusts you more than us
think so i'll john i will just transfer
it to you
okey dokey
thanks
okay
do we have everybody um
alexander is here okay
i think we could start
so
hi everybody and welcome to weekly meet
number 101 it's uh 101
dangerously good times
you know what i did there so thanks for
joining us and we have some really great
presentations today all lined up from
royal cats to virtual vips
and the best place to launch your
everscale project
and much more i also have a note from mr
milo he would like everyone to know that
the first batch of initial member
reports
that he mentioned last week and the week
prior will be going to a vote on everdao
today
to determine if their tokens will be
unlocked
so if you want to go check it out uh go
to everdao.net and i'm not sure if the
reports are exactly up yet but you can
expect about at least 10 minimum of 10 i
believe
um and if they're not up yet then i'm
sure that we'll be sending out some
messages in the chats and telegram and
discord um and update everybody
so you can go check it out once it is up
so
that's not quite yet according to yeah
refresh so
hang tight everyone okay well it should
be up today
looking forward to that
so without further ado uh we'll kick off
the first topic with the man the myth
the legendary mr media
with the tech updates
yeah don't have much actually we kind of
rolling as i said
they upgrade to the network slowly
and
there are some
[Music]
kind of
complicated
stuff bottom line
but safety first
so
very very gradual update
still
um
like
about
eighty percent of our validators have
been upgraded
um i've seen some issues we have fixed
some issues so
that's um going on once we're
certain it's okay
at this thing we are going to
slowly reduce it
hopefully like
maybe even today
but not certain to select a group of
validators
because there is a there is as i said
there is a big um
like probability that the network will
hold halt if we
just release the upgrade because it
takes
sometimes about half an hour 40 minutes
for a network to kind of
repair the database so if we just go and
release it everyone will start doing
this and
the network will stall for some time so
we don't want to do that obviously so
kind of
that's that's complication of stuff
so yeah apart from that
apart from that we are very busy on
ramp
and
it's already in
in basically it's kind of in high load
testing now
and
it has also
sdk
kind of integration phase currently to
production
which
will take until uh may 10th something
like that and uh we hope that
like on the week of may 10th
um we're going to
kind of try to push ramp
maybe towards like 15 we'll try to push
them into devnet see how that goes
and
from there you know whatever time
requires for everyone to adapt to but up
their applications because
they will have
a few statuses new statuses that they
can
you know fit their application with they
can decide based on the statuses if they
want to wait
until
kind of
the final finality or they are okay with
just letting
um the first status which basically
means like there are several statuses
and for some applications actually the
first one will be enough like uh if it's
accepted by ramp
you can just you know close the
application basically
some applications may say okay it's fine
and for that for other applications you
may wait until it will be included in
the block
once it's included in the block it's
almost certain like with a very high
probability like nine nine point some
nines
um that
this message will be executed in in
in the following blocks if not in this
one
and um but of course there are some
applications like when you're like
transferring huge amount of money or if
you if you
have uh you know several transactions in
the chain then
you know
like depends on what the chain of
transactions are
um
you may wait until you know the final
confirmation of the final transaction
not necessarily because sometimes you
if the contracts that are transacting
are only the user contracts and you can
predict that they will be okay because
you know that
from the first message external message
if the first external message is
delivered then the rest of the messages
will be will be delivered for sure and
if you're certain that your smart
contract will execute them then you
don't need to wait
so a lot of decisions to be made on the
on the kind of user side of things
uh the developer side of things and we
will allow some time for that but yeah
but right now okay as i said the ramp is
our priority
currently for the next like big network
upgrade
thanks
er ivan do you have a question yeah evan
has his hand raised
yeah i do uh so basically
no that that's not my question actually
uh there is a question but
yeah there is a question by community
member
[Music]
so the question is uh what is a
there are a few questions actually so
the first is um
uh
what what is the status of a new
consensus
because this community member thinks
that new consensus is much more
important than the ramp and he
like uh
his opinion is that we don't need trump
we need new consensus first but but
basically can you elaborate on new
consensus thing and uh how how soon can
we uh like expect it to to come to
devnet at least and and what is which is
most most important will there be
some some document with more like
in-depth description of new consensus uh
because we see that in a white paper
that there is some high-level
description of consensus but will there
be a technical like specification or or
something
okay i will start from the beginning
then first of all the sun token is
trading at 2.83
but tdl is kind of 86 000. so i think
the the you need to increase the tvl
before before you ask a question how
soon
that's i because i cannot you know i
cannot trade on the token with such a
low liquidity
we need we need more of this
so i can i can make better predictions
on how soon something will be there
so that's that's um about how soon
for the priority on the series on a
serious note yeah on the serious note
for some for the priorities
all right so uh first of all
um
there are different people who work on
ramp in the consensus that's one thing
second the fear second thing is that
one is not less important than the other
i mean i understand there is an opinion
that something is more important than
the other
but um it's not and
but again it doesn't matter even if it
would i couldn't make it faster
just by adding more people it doesn't
work like that really
so um the new consensus is in progress
it it's
it has a
it has a kind of working
prototype
um
there is a technical documentation about
the about this which is not released yet
i mean it's released but not publicly
the technical specifications of the new
consensus and uh
i don't think it will be released before
the middle uh like of may
uh that's what i think now
now um but
this is because we worked on the
specification the specification not so
much a description i mean we have a
description already
but rather
kind of we
like made an effort and this is a um
pavel andre lassien and some other guys
from proven the team
and now there is actually continuous
research
we added additional mathematician to to
that we're counting
all sorts of
probabilities around this i mean you
understand it's a probabilistic
consensus so you cannot prove or
disprove completely like something
because there is it's not the
probability of one um
so well you can claim that and i can i
can claim that every consensus network
concerns protocol is probabilistic but
uh you know it it depends on how you
view the probability and of what
but
if you say that bfc concerns the
probability of one or the network stalls
then in
our
protocol is not
though
the difference between one
and
some number which is very close to one
in terms of real application is
so indistinguishable
from the security standpoint that it
doesn't matter
but we have to be sure how close is this
to one and what are the kind of all
sorts of variables that can be that can
be
uh accounted in so will there be
any formal proof for this epsilon
probability
there is no proof for probability there
is a count you can count the probability
that then then you can kind of
uh
you know
say that you didn't count correctly so
that's why we wanted to be sure that we
count correctly
right and that's why we have some
math behind this
now and behind things that
are even behind things that are kind of
obvious if you think about them like if
you think about them logically just a
logical
uh conclusion would be
that it's you know good enough
but
sometimes we don't want to be
uh relying on just logic so we want some
more formal methods
and uh you know of counting these things
including probabilities so
yeah so basically
a lot of math
work went into consensus still going uh
as we speak
for last
you know four or five months
and we are very pleased with the results
we believe
if we didn't believe before we did but
uh you know now we even more
believing that this consensus is really
great it's uh it's really great
and uh and then
there are some things that need to be
tuned in implementation level because
this there is there are it's not just
okay we're created we're like okay we we
invented new consensus that's not enough
because this concerns can be just bad
you know you can invest consensus which
is not
and we have this in practice a lot as
you know
flying around in this blockchain world
where everyone is creating new consensus
not necessarily every consensus is good
enough look at
cardano
for example right
so no no slander here please yeah okay
okay
yeah great consensus i mean formally
proved or aborts formally proof
consensus just take more than 30 seconds
to finalize
so yeah we have a great consensus
formally approved which is absolutely
unusable oh yeah i mean one of the
important things about this consensus
practicality of it and and of course the
practicality is measured by finality
block times
all sorts of things like that
and um
now we're working on improving the
finality even further uh because one
thing is to say okay
you know some there is a theoretical
construct okay we send a message here
and there and that's okay i mean it's
okay from the standpoint of the safety
maybe but maybe it's not okay from the
standpoint of actual practical financial
analysis so
to to
to kind of decrease the finality
uh sometimes requires some additional
tricks on top and that's kind of what
we're doing so anyway
it's it's a work in progress
um we cannot speed it up
we cannot speed it up it will be when it
will be um
okay cool just just was interested in in
the current status so you described it
well thank you
and uh
and uh there is uh one one more question
as well uh also from community uh i
already maybe know the answer but but
but we need like the some public
elaboration on that uh about the status
of drive changing
drive chain we started to develop it so
we're currently constructing well we
kind of had a research where there is
our great alina uh who's a research
engineer in
cryptography
and she
she she did the implementation of um
bls signatures for the new consensus
this work is finished um it's already
delivered it's in the node already
so it's integrated actually the node now
can accept and and verify bls signatures
so by the way this is of course part of
the consensus implementation and it's
already delivered
um so she now moved to work chain uh
about a month ago and she's doing the
modeling now
first she did the research on the
consensus on the on the drive chain that
you know
i have uh you know the design and now
she she
verified the design did some research on
the design
of the different uh you know
storage mechanisms
he kind of finalized the the basically
conceptual design with all the
security
like models guarantees and so on and now
now she's she's doing modeling in python
so there will be a drive chain
implementation on titan first where we
can like that was exactly like we did
with consensus we have a model of design
for consensus algorithm actually in
python so now we will have the drive
chain implementation button and uh from
that point we will just uh you know once
we tested everything and uh
yeah and so on then we will just move it
to rust
does it include the networking glare or
is it just a local model no no it's
local model it doesn't need to include
it has some variables like delays and
the load backflows so you can emulate
the network but it's just an emulator
but but it's it's uh it's important kind
of for for all sorts of uh things yeah
sure sure everything starts with
modeling okay thank you thank you for
answers
maybe let's let's proceed i think we
should uh move on though because we have
other presentations to take care of and
we want to make sure that we can squeeze
them in too but michael thank you very
much you mentioned that you didn't have
that much of an update to do but it
sounds like
may is going to be a really good month
for every scale and there's a lot
of interesting things coming up
thank you and michael please please hold
please hold early questions because we
have um some really good presentations
coming up
we want to make sure that we could fit
everybody in
sorry about that
um
so next up on the agenda is something
really cool
and i wanna i wanna oh come on it is
it it's test day we're testing here
we're trialling something a little bit
new so okay well
so for all you cool cats and kittens out
there
we're gonna hear it from
our own benjamin bateman and bull bash
are gonna head off claw to claw and they
hacked up a
nice big hairy
juicy interview for you all
well yeah i mean uh as you say but ball
bash is kind of the the go between he
he's referring to himself as uh as my
interviewee's agent uh in his own words
um so as you say before i actually um
get get to the interview in a bit of a
video uh presentation because we
recorded the interview this morning
ahead of time
for time and brevity and showmanship you
know me
um but yes i do have this uh this um
yeah
this copy i've been given by his agent
to read before i play the video so bear
with me
can you show your screen i will do in a
second the video will come after the
introduction to the video i've been
given very specific instructions here
my interview is um a very peculiar
individual so uh
hear ye hear ye
spartacus launches into the blockchain
of history
we told you to prepare for glory and now
the time has arrived
under the guidance of king meowdis the
spartacats per token generation event is
here
curious cats amongst you will be
intrigued to dig up the details of the
tokenomics of spartacats and the uh
exciting 300 nft legion launch sorry i
messed up that line sorry king leaders
um but yes king meowtis has sworn the
sacred oaths of spartacus honor to be
transparent open source and receptive to
the voices of his 300 and everyone in
this
the area of sparta
so to get involved with the puerto
pincel and stake your claim in the
spills of sparta head over to everstart
on the sixth of the 5th 22 or forever
remain in the mud with the nuts
that was very dramatic wasn't it that's
a very good copy okay so uh if we just
bear with me for two seconds let's try
and share a screen and make sure we
share the
[Music]
full screen that i do apologize folks i
am a little bit older than i look then i
come across sometimes and i have
recently tried to get into the old mac
thing so
you have to bear with me there we go
yeah yeah i found the buttons
that's all this windows to mac it's
confusing but right here we go good job
grandpa
thank you thank you very much enjoy
if it plays uh if not
that's an epic video
ah joanne had lived for me for two
seconds that's a wrong bloody video i am
an old grandparent i told you this was
going to be experimental
right
finder
bear with me folks
oh
i hope he's coming back
he forgot his depends i guess for
grandpa
come back ben
let's see
i'm gonna ping him if he's having any
issues
right uh i don't apologize i'm having
issues but it's purely just me not
knowing how to use a mac as well as i've
known windows like i say i've been very
uh windows loyal my whole life but so
let's do it i'm gonna play the shorter
version of the video and then if i can
find the slightly longer version with
the video at the start and i'll play
that at the end for brevity here so uh
right screen share one more time for you
i don't know we don't want to control
that scripture
optimized for video clip yay
right can you all say that can you can
you say
yes i could see but it looks the same as
last time yes that's what i'm saying i'm
being an old man i can't find the uh the
the longer version but this is the
shorter one
i guess without any further ado
welcome king meowidus uh your honor your
grace
how are you
hi hello
okay so i guess we'll get started
quickly um
first of all i would like to uh ask uh
why why why is it you've decided that
now is the right time for well
for you the right moment in time for you
to make your own arrival
because
today's the day
that that's very digging yesterday
is definitely uh the day okay so um well
what do you say to uh
those kind of naysayers out there uh in
in the industry or outside the industry
who are saying that nfts and blockchain
are bad for the environment
oh
i say
piss off
okay that's very direct i like your
style
on to our next question then um how will
the uh the legion of the 300 the 300
sparta cats be selected or chosen
is that a real question
a spartacus not chosen
they choose themselves
they stretch their back out long stretch
their legs far and claw and scratch away
until they claim what is rightfully
theirs
[Music]
right i should have your head man child
name coin is a crowd of glory and there
are champions and legend it's not meant
to be the circus of mockery that he that
mr mosque has
oh let's created ahead touch yourself
take it you're not a fan of uh evon
king you mean
that's a bit harsh i mean
he's not that bad is he
you support him
well no
but i mean
you know
sorry
i do apologize if i've offended you um
i guess we'll probably wrap things up
there and i'm very excited to see your
project and thank you very much for uh
for speaking to me today uh king meowed
us um yeah looking forward to uh
yes prepare for glory thank you very
much
have a good day
bye
oh
oh hello
well that was interesting how did you
manage to get that ominous cat guy on a
on a zoom call uh it was um yeah like i
say i i was uh having oh there we go my
mic is uh the ball bash was playing uh
the the kind of agents to uh the the
very mysterious and um
slightly aloof as you can tell uh king
meowdis uh i don't think he likes me
much to be honest but uh obviously he
likes everscale so yeah i mean great
that's all that matters right and there
there is actually a uh a bit more of a
slightly professional a proper promo
video which i'll find out now for you
while we do the other presentation and
we can close on that as a lovely little
uh kind of close thing how's that sound
joe okay that's that's meowsing yeah
housing
do you do you have any links to share is
there anything that uh
you know like follow a twitter account
yeah if you're in the telegram there has
just been a big post gone out uh via
everscale news which has all the links
um like i say the main uh thing to watch
really is uh ever starts will be the
token generation event on the 6th of may
so very fitting uh right ahead of the
anniversary and everything yeah oh and
oh hey how's that for a sec
oh speaking of the anniversary that's
the next topic
as you know let the cat out
we need some cats there oh i think i
think spartacats is actually going to be
there right i think so
yeah cool may 7th may 7th it's the
second year anniversary of every scale
so you cannot miss it don't miss it and
now you can show off your swagger and
claim a vip table
showcase your project and things like
that for yourself it's up to you
and we have data here who's going to
share some
really cool updates to the
our ever space in mona
so what you can do what your project can
do
and claiming that table so data do you
want to
show off
the new editions yeah of course um i
have uh some uh work to do if um
there is um
much to do but uh we have already
something to show sorry my cat doing
weird stuff i have a sparta cat at home
so she she's trying to
respond
yeah so uh yeah yeah if you want to
to buy a space uh to buy a frame in the
ever bar you can just buy this you can
click on that frame and you will be
redirected to
the grand bazaar and actually i
i
give you a chance to make a bid and
take this place for uh
just uh
a hundred or ever
and
about vip tables i will i will show you
that in a second
but sorry it's a little bit laggy as
always yeah
so here we are
uh yeah as you can see there is a lot of
tables and uh if you want to
take it to to
have a chance to
have an avatar like vitalik here you can
just buy uh just click at the
um
screen with us data
it's only coming up very small in your
background on youtube ah
yeah of course
uh one second
[Music]
i think he's
it's a little bit too weird with uh my
uh program ah no yes yeah maybe like
that if it's a big hassle don't worry
too much i was just thinking it's only
taking up oh there we go
yeah like that okay
so uh as you can see you can click on
any card uh on reservation cap and you
can reserve it at uh grand bazaar also
uh place a bid uh for now just uh
300 error but
it will depend on on what people want
and
for now i have just this table but i
will continue to
to work and
update the bar
and uh
i think there is uh
almost uh
20 tables or something like that and i i
can show you a great example of what can
be
if you take a table with a
canvas with a frame at the
back
sorry
so there is an
example of my uh
for presentation of my project this is
uh metamodern times it's a sitcom series
uh
serial that will uh
be in french english and uh russian uh
for now it's just existing uh there is
just two episodes uh in french it's not
uh uh it's not done yet but uh you can
see uh those first uh those
avatars
from the
from the series
and
when when the
when the serial will be available i will
make a button here and everyone will be
able to
to see
this this sitcom
and uh yeah so for every
you know this is not active yet but i
used um
sorry i can't i can't find a
word to explain but um
this week i will try to to work hard and
make
all those tables be available on a grand
bazaar and also for
for drinks
there is a
bartender on every
every bar and i will be
to be licked also to the grand bazaar
that's perfect that's great thank you
very much is that keanu reeves at your
table you kind of look like him
you know it's it's one of my alter ego
when you work in the metaverse you you
you
you just have uh
much much many uh alter egos so this is
uh
this is uh the one who work with uh
with the
premiere pro and all that kind of stuff
this one it's me it's just to to make
the show
and this one this one is used to to talk
politics and the business he is i see
him with like having conversation it's
pretty funny yeah i love it i love it
let's make sure to share all the links
for this so people can jump in clean
tables get wall space and so on links to
grand bazaar links to uh the mona space
this is great
thank you
thank you and sorry for my english uh
no that's great i think everybody
understands
i i didn't really
uh yeah is there any hardware
requirements to join
just uh
a piece of a
[Music]
modern cart i think uh with something
that
is not too too old i think
if it's
five years old that's fine
but if it six or seven i think it will
be uh more luggage uh than me right now
and uh for me it's lucky because i have
zoom because and all that stuff at the
same time in my avatar in real time
so i guess
it will not be
too laggy i can i will um
uh drop the lynch on zoom
yeah like i think you're asking a lot of
zoom to be honest to play back in uh
full frame i think he's also using obs
as well
yeah i'm using
yeah i'm using another uh uh another
program um that call it polypop it's uh
it's more advanced than
obs it's
it's adapted for a 3d
interactive
stuff
but but to being but to join the party
you only need just a regular
pc or a mac and a browser internet you
don't need uh special anything
you can do
okay
yeah just uh
actually on a
macbook air is working perfectly yeah so
uh
it's a moana just off this okay is mono
compatible with um objects and stuff
made with blender or is it a specialized
software
uh yeah it's compatible with blend bear
it's complete money it's
built on top of
unity and unity works uh great with a
blender
three days of school day thank you very
much bud
it was perfect thank you for sharing it
um
i think we'll move on to the next one if
you want to stop sharing your screen
yeah
right
so the next presentation we have is the
ever start launch pad
if you're active in community chats uh
then you're well aware that everstart
launchpad has already helped
catapult two successful projects so far
and i think raised over 15 million ever
i believe which is great and we have
alexandra here
yeah
danny cameron yeah i hear you and she'll
share some further news and information
so if you're ready alexandra floyd yes
great thank you for the opportunity to
present our start on the meetup so
what is every start ever start is a
decentralized launch part based on our
scale how does it work for example the
project wants to launch its token on
everstart
so there was a queue token sale on the
platform the project puts tokens for
sale and indicates the currency for
which this tokens will be sold in this
case for example cubes were sold forever
the project also indicates the minimum
required amount to start a project it's
soft cap for example if the project
didn't
collect
the minimum
necessary minimum to launch a project
the project will not be launched on
every start there is also a hard cap
it's the maximum amount of money raised
so for example if the hard cap is
exceeded then some of the money is
returned to a participant proportionally
they receive cube for a percentage
percentage of the amount that
participates in the launch pad
several teams are working on a restart
uh so ever kids is just one of the teams
every kid is engaged in communication
with the community for example now i'm
presenting uh do you ever start social
also we work with social networks and
partially we work with design
uh
front end and so on there are also teams
that develop products not only in a
scale but also in now or in our networks
they're just for example creating smart
contracts looking for projects that will
be large at large part and so on
the project is completely decentralized
and works on open source smart contacts
you can find a link to the github on the
website
on every step website and important for
example if uh even if payment uh is
accepted in one specific specified
currency so as i said before uh if you
want to get q you have to pay in ever
but it doesn't work like that members
can make a deposit from any rich
supported network transfer over the
bridge and exchange for a desired token
takes place without your users
participations so you can deposit any
token supported by a bridge
and flag keep exchange
and
i think that it's very convenient
and now let's talk about updates
awaiting us in the near future now
projects can raise funds not only in
ever but also in any deep dip three
tokens
also
amen talking
with game have five elements will be
launched at the launch pad you can find
information on our advocate diagram chat
telegram channel and so on also on our
twitter and everstat will launch its own
talking with a
deflation deflationary economic model
with the help of a token it will be
possible to obtain a guaranteed
allocation for your deposit even if your
hard cap
has been exceeded tokens that were paid
for receiving guaranteed allocation will
be burned so after each token launchpad
it will become less and less
so i guess that's all for a start if you
have any question
i will be glad to answer them thank you
okay does anybody have any questions for
alexandra
i haven't seen any um maybe there will
be some at the end of the call
just goes to show what a nice clear
presentation he was
yeah
so i guess if you're working on a cool
project and you'd like a nice boost and
some support ping the everstart team and
is there a telegram chat or some
community
you can you can find uh
also i can uh for example use
you know youtube chat uh i will post a
link so it's ever start chat on
instagram you can find it and you can
answer any question there
okay
yeah drop drop the links around i'm sure
people would like to join and ask
questions check out some more
information
thank you very much um the next
part of our agenda is everscale
marketing update and today we have a new
face we have a new face joining us today
so i'm pleased to introduce alex who's a
marketing manager for everscale
oh people's ears are picking up now yeah
hello hello yeah and in his past life he
worked at a creative agency and in the
gaming industry which is really cool so
i know that a lot of people all over the
ecosystem have tons of questions about
marketing
and so we're very lucky to have alex
with us today he has also prepared a
short presentation i believe
um so welcome to every scale welcome to
the weekly meet um
and please meet alex
yeah thank you joe
my pleasure to be here and yes if you
have questions regarding marketing
should but after i drop some slides into
this stream if i can
let me try to share that
my keynote
voila can you see something on the
screen yeah that's good because i'm in
i'm in a streaming mode cool awesome
so yeah i've prepared
a quick update on what's up in every
scale marketing
and
i know that
typically people love pictures and
numbers and they try to put both here
but it's mostly the numbers for this for
this round
so yeah but i think it would be
interesting
uh
first of all let's check out what's
going on on our website on
everscale.network
as you can see in terms of traffic we've
doubled since february which is awesome
i believe
uh we've issued some interesting updates
like a style guide for everscale which
is helping our marketing efforts with
projects with key opinion leaders with
everyone else we've integrated our blog
onto the website with the widget and we
made an awesome run page which is
helping
projects to look for our for definite
alliance grants and
by numbers
most of people came to our website
directly or type in instagram and google
second was pr links and
our socials event
and as for socials as for shows we've
currently changed the way we're working
on our twitter
instead of being you know like posting
posting daily we keep posting daily but
we also
how to say engaging with elon musk and
other popular popular popular twitter
accounts elon musk is a joke for sure
but we're engaging with like elon musk
of the crypto
world
by commenting their posts by reacting to
them and that helped us to
grow the number of impressions as you
can see on the chart
next
social prs
for prs our idea is to
do a kind of big blast to tier one or
tier two media
at least two times per month or ideally
every week that's our approach that we
have taken in order to
increase the visibility of every scale
and this is actually what we're doing
you can see some examples here
we've
advertised our
grant program trying to attract even
more developers and scouts into it
now we're running an awesome contest
with trading you i guess everyone knows
that what trading view is it's a
charting platform plus kind of social
networking for investors
and we are doing a cool cooperation with
them
contests for everyone can win some
tokens and the premium subscription to
trading queue
and last but not least i think everyone
has seen already the fantastic article
about our network on coin telegraph if
not
just google it it can be easily found or
just look at it on the concealed website
it's a comprehensive report about what's
going on on everscale and how superior
it
to everything in crypto world
that's a kind of key blast that we've
been up to for the past
couple of months which which i'm here
uh
and for the
next for the future we've prepared
something as well
first of all we worked really hard on
defining
how actually how we actually bring uh
everscale how to make it popular how to
make it famous
and we define the strategy like which is
quite comprehensive i don't want to go
into into this in very high level of
detail because you can see it's kind of
huge and this is just the part of the
file
but the idea here is
that we need to perfectly understand
who our audiences are starting from
consumers ending up with
investors and institutional clients
which are what are their needs and which
measures messages we need to shoot and
in which channels and that's the work
that we've
900 completed i would say almost
complete
and
we start working quite aggressively on
this framework uh
specifically
in terms of upcoming screens with
marketing swings who are thinking about
a big pr article
into one media's
in all tier one videos i will say about
the progress that the network has made
on its roadmap and the progress is
amazing i think it's
really this subject is worth the
uh i don't know five to ten publications
next we're starting our twitter ads
finally it took us some time to like to
sort out all you know financial issues
but we're ready
to go to the open open twitter
see
and attract even more people to our to
our communities to our website to our
projects
for sure
and finally we're now testing not why
not yet testing the waters but we're
preparing to test the waters with
influencers
which i think everyone understands how
important it is to engage with proper
influencers on youtube and twitter and
we are building
our plans as per our strategy yeah i
think that's
yeah that's more or less
it in
brief they're probably overall there are
many things going on in marketing i
don't try to put everything here because
there are much
job and there is a huge underwater part
of the iceberg in preparing and
rearranging thing in hiring people who
can help us with twitter i mean there
are many things going on but this is
something you can see on the top of this
iceberg and uh
trust me the top of this iceberg will be
growing growing like hell in the
following couple of months
that's fantastic thank you it's very
very interesting um you've shared some
great insights here and i'd love to see
some analytics next time to learn more
about how people like discover us a bit
of what the high level what you've shown
before you know who they are what works
best and why it's something that we've
we've never done before you know we used
to do absolutely zero tracking
um but
we've come to learn that things like
this are very important for improvement
and growth um
studying what you've done how it works
why it works and things like that
so thank you very much just throw is the
hand job we are not tracking too much
for sure or not no no i know but it's
not our business we're just tracking our
links and we're not collecting and any
yeah
you know data we just see some google
analytics dashboards and that that's
what we see
but for sure we try to to analyze you
know which which media works for us best
which blogger can work for us best or
which you know this this level of
details not individual level for sure
it's all okay
yeah anyone would with their you know
farming activities for sure not no no
it's it's not in our policy so but yeah
uh in terms of media selection uh it's a
very interesting subject so from what we
see is that uh as as
as we do more you know prs then
we can see that it really helps us to
build the proper traffic people are
really interested to see what's going on
and they're getting to our website to
learn more they browse different pages
that's why the website is very important
and it will be it will be progressing
it's not a kind of static thing it will
be developing that's obviously what i
can see
and on twitter i think numbers are
speaking for itself the more we talk to
people the less we sit in our old small
aquarium the more we'll go outreach talk
to people about what ever skill is about
what our talking is and what to do with
it the more the more we grow so that's
it's our way we go out
and we hope that the world will welcome
us
and
for now i can see only positive things
have started as you see the numbers are
growing and consumer feedback is quite
cool and i see some raised hands on the
chat and then the chat
should
yeah
obviously
sort of a leading question i kind of
know what your answer may be but just
just for uh
the hippies the punks out there that are
the people and kind of on the anarchist
side
this conversation between you two then
obviously
it sounds very corporate yeah we're very
very traditional business very marketing
very you know
do you guys think and i mean the date
goes to yourself as well i'm joking from
kind of this world um do you think that
this kind of approach has you know uh
a place in the in the crypto anarchist
world
uh
yes it's it's about having some
structure we need some things to be able
to jump off of and learn you know so we
know we're going in the right direction
so i i think it's good
what i would say but it's a it's a valid
point i would think it will not i know
what you mean actually it doesn't i mean
it's a very interesting this thing
never went to life because we were
discussing with ben how we how would
talk is ever scared what is our tone of
voice what is our kind of personality
and we can kind of not argue not argue
but we came to nothing and that's the
discussion that i just shouted
a lot i think and you're and i think
you're right and i'm right also it's a
kind of decentralized work but i mean it
definitely depends on audiences because
because the beauty the beauty of our i'm
not talking business the beauty of our
environment the beauty of ecosystem that
we're talking with very very different
people we're talking with you know young
guys who are just entering the the the
crypto the blockchain point there is one
language for them and then we're talking
maybe some whales some midwest or some
serious guys and or in the jackets and
there is another thing and it also not
ah maybe like this
they have a jacket a formal one
my color isn't starched enough i don't
think
okay bother us but there are other guys
say i mean so we need to kind of we need
to be kind of
not a chameleon but we definitely need
to adapt adapt to situations and direct
accordingly we don't want to be stuck in
some kind of formal language for sure
it's not our way we're adaptive and
decentralized in what we do and that's
our dna
if i can say that in that formal
marketing corporate language which you
hate but i'm a corporate marketer sorry
for that i can't i cannot get rid of it
you're slowly bringing me away and
bringing me around the way of thinking
in small parts i think we'll always
disagree a little bit but yeah you are
bringing me around so thank you it's a
scene test like if we put it together it
will boom
sure
i think that's a good way to put it ivan
you have a question
yeah
there is a small one
recently i sent you around two
tables with twitter influencers with uh
prices etc etc and uh just wondering how
do they perform maybe you had the chance
to test them
yeah easy answer well
for influencers as i have i've made a
slide for that but anyway uh influencers
we are
just playing
for influencers
for
like for twitter the easy the low
hanging fruit for us is just normal ads
like what like what solana does what
polka dot does just normal ads for
influencers we are collecting inputs i
think we i have collected inputs from
different people and from agencies even
like i don't know how many these tables
have maybe 10
and we put everything together
right we look with we're not just taking
influencers as bulk right we're not
not not it's not our way we're not
buying in bulk we're not
becoming people pushing them to do this
it's not our way we're hand-picking
we're hand-picking the guys
the influencers which we want to work
with right that share that are sharing
our approach
that are sharing our
language or whatever like what what
what's been saying about that
uh and and then after we're done it's a
complicated process and because there's
also a financial side of it because so
most of these influences are not in the
position like the work
because they love every scale so much
unfortunately not yet i hope it will
come but for now it's all about
money thing that he didn't think so we
need to plan financials also properly so
your input is very valuable i mean all
the inputs i receive from smart guys
like you like ben like joe is very
valuable it's really helping me is
helping you know every scale to move on
because it's not one
one you know one person work to do all
marketing it doesn't work this way it's
many many people working together
actually i'm just coordinating i'm just
a coordinator
so yeah and yeah your input is taken is
being analyzed
we're looking at many different inputs
to set to build a short list and we're
we're in the process maybe we're too
very thorough about that but it's our
way
we don't want to to make foolish things
we don't
want to spend our efforts unwisely
about it's it's taken no specific
progress but it's very valuable input
yeah cool thank you and uh there is
another question uh about today
so
there were uh a blogger who was
like uh
who started to to making some videos
uh just just by own intent his name is
creepster mac
i hope you you know it
i think i'm planning to drink coffee
with him creepster yes i know the guy we
were trying to schedule for a coffee
break sometimes i i just wanna watching
along on youtube so you're right buddy
yeah yeah so
the question was maybe you have seen
around some other bloggers who already
made uh videos forever scale do you
monitor
the
the activity which is like out of our so
i i i'm talking about people who are
doing uh stuff by their intent and do
they monitor
yeah for sure for sure there are some uh
there are some you know influencers on
on youtube on twitter also who do talk
about us natively
that's
true we do monitor
and it's like we
want
everything not every single want all
good bloggers
to be our ambassadors and we are always
open for a coffee break for an
interesting project for whatever
creative idea i mean that's
we
and yeah we do monitor everything
is that it ivan i think that's that's it
yeah yeah that's that's not the need
yeah
thanks alex that was some pretty
thorough answers uh i think it was great
having you on
the call because there has been a lot of
everybody's always asking about
marketing on the calls and it's good to
have another another face here so you
can see that there's a lot of people
behind the scenes and there's a lot of
stuff for sure for sure now if if anyone
has a question have a question about
marketing should
it's my job to take into account and uh
of course all inputs of ideas i'm always
looking for some
crazy ideas mad ideas stupid ideas
whatever ideas from from from our
awesome community
so they're all
all comments and ideas are pretty
welcome and critics also
that doesn't segue to uh my little final
benz bits i don't know what does joe
well we've got the q a first we've got q
a first and then and then it's your
bitty bits
yeah
i'm a patient man i'm very hot i'll wait
then i am looking forward to seeing the
bits he wants to see
i love i love beats he loves he loves
bits i think you guys need to have a
coffee break you guys can set something
off
yep so let's say we have any questions
you love birds
uh the first one there's one on youtube
i think it's for misha
michael if you're still here and still
with us how long should we wait for flex
at least hint give me a hint
if you join the group of the beta
testers of flex then you're kind of
getting more idea about when to expect
it
and
basically
flex is in the there is one last thing
that we need to
uh to test add and test that is
immigration protocol which is
implemented now and um
it's uh it's
integration in integration right now so
integration and testing then we're
reducing
that's it so i don't know exact time
frames for these things because that
depends on how many issues we will find
but you know we are
we're almost there that there is um
well it definitely may i mean
because we're already for five days
before me so it's definitely may it's
not june so
it's my
it's just time frame is going
you know
very soon then that's the answer
it's me
not soon it's very soon
enjoying the better not sooner than may
not later than may so it's may but then
soon i mean you could say soon and it
could be like a year from now like how
soon is the may
it's may soon
yeah as soon as may yeah
that's a good answer
and a good tip too join the beta group
you get a lot of information there
and there's another question i believe
it's also for you uh it's about
uh from elia he says what about
gosh status uh and i don't understand
this question really it says i'm check
ref
if i
still not work or not docs
do you know
can you
translate this question
yeah i can translate this question but
i'm not commenting on that i mean
the
the gosh
is in progress
and uh
you know
once we feel that the information should
become public we will
you know
publish this information and i will
comment and right now
as i told dailyr that um
there are still some experimental things
that
he sees and he tests and thank you very
much it's incredible like uh
that you're doing this but it's
a little bit too soon to test i guess
what you see at least
um
and
and that's all my comments for now
okay uh michael you have a question
yeah thank you
uh mitchell this one this one's for you
uh just for the protocol what's up were
the dark ghouls uh the last time i asked
to check it was early february
that they should be on up and running
and the question that's connected to
them the rest cap
rest cap the pools rest cap
whatever it is because i think that this
topic is sort of
not particularly covered
and i guess that the validators and all
the participants would like to have a
pretty good update on what's what what's
happening and what's coming thank you
sure not a problem
um so as i said there are
there are dark cool smart contracts
which are ready for quite some some some
time already like months
if someone wants to use them
you're welcome they're published their
api published everything published
um
nobody did
and so it's it's it's usual thing with
our community like
it it's not only that you need to cook
the meal you also need to kind of put it
on the plate
feed someone you know sit someone feed
someone and you know we don't have time
for that i mean i don't have time for
that
so um so that's about dark well darkpool
was
wasn't created for that darko was
created for something else or kwpc it's
a kwpc uh smart contracts
and um
they have been integrated into the kwpc
investor flow
now um and kwpc is waiting for flex to
start to in order to kick kick the thing
and um
so so darkful usage for
um for the the rust cup thing is is
again is something that
i proposed to do as an intermediary
solution but i i didn't say that i will
lead that
process
um to actually use them using them okay
so that's one thing
there for the uh for the
um the elector itself because that's
connected
the lecture is in
like the vector contracts
are
done
already a month ago
we're now implementing the node um
support for this and we have done
almost everything
we now we came to the conclusion that
the best thing to do they know well you
start testing and then you realize
something that you can improve something
that need to improve something
so we came to the conclusion that we
need to add a special tvm instruction
that's the best actual way to to kind of
implement the connection between the
node and the and the and the this
the electric process
so this instruction is in doing now and
so once this is finished we we basically
go to integrate integration testing
again integration testing uh will start
sometime in may we we will uh
we will put it on the network hopefully
on mate and
again
and um you know a lot of things happen
in the maintenance so it's uh
probably there is a reason for that but
i'm not sure
but anyway on may 10th where we're kind
of
hope to see
this in some network and then after
testing it will
find its way to
uh
to the
to the ever scale main net and then you
can
do whatever you want for that again
maybe
you want to do rust tools
[Music]
but and i didn't realize that all the
current dipoles will be
closed all the current deals
should be closed in order to transfer
the network to the electoral contracts
so
that is not an easy thing to do
not in terms of coordination not in
terms of security not in terms of like
it's it's a huge
kind of
well upgrade
so
this when you talk about huge upgrades
you never talk about precise timing
because it's just
you know just impossible to know
so is july the best
i don't know i mean it's uh again
this is not up to me and i can deliver
the solution but i cannot speed up
processes around the delivery of the
code around the uh testing like formal
verification for example of the code and
stuff like that so it's a lot of um
it's actually my question the good thing
about that is that the contract itself
is actually easier
it's simpler than the depool and elector
contract it's much simpler than that so
in that respect it's much easier to
verify much easier to validate much
easier to kind of audit and stuff so
that's why i'm kind of optimistic that
it won't take too long after we test the
solution on the integration of the
network
but i may be wrong
you're in a good position
you're really in a good position because
you're delivering huge brains
you're not talking about the clients and
uh
nothing depends on you only
what do you want from me i mean do you
want not to deliver them like fine i
mean i can stop i mean
do you want less
less huge upgrades
i don't know i can do that it's easy
yeah they can predict more i think
precisely i think i think that's a group
of people called validators in every
scale wants to have sort of a road map
and due to whatever reason
there is a road map i mean there's a
road map watching those questions
i think that i think that's roadmap
should be published or whatever because
again
there is a number of people a group of
people which are called validators which
are like you know
the basis of the network and i think
that there is some lack of
communications with that group of people
and again on voicing that's why we have
these calls michael that's why we have
these calls
to come yeah i know but something like
everything paper
i'm here i'm here every week to do
precisely this no no no on paper what do
you want me to write on paper soon i
mean you we have a road map which is
published by the network
you know there is a roadmap for you you
can always refer to this roadmap
i'm not giving any more roadmaps i mean
enough this it's a marketing
blah blah
because it's um
the the like
it's not some you know
when you when you do the button on the
website we waited two years for a button
on the website by the way but when you
do the button on the website that would
be easy i mean i could tell you that
but when we talk about like i just just
on this call
just on this call
uh count on
fingers how many huge projects
i just mentioned in terms of like
structural network products that usually
take for other networks years to do
years to do with much larger budget and
we are way more developers than we have
and so on i mean how many
just count
just in that course there is a number
but this this this is not the question
that i'm raising and that that's that's
not going to be sorry
i understand
i think i answered it
yes
i answered i answered as the best of my
ability i mean i i communicate whatever
i know right i cannot i don't know don't
ask me what will happen you know
yesterday
yeah
yesterday said that about putin that
that that his generals are always
feeding him
with the wrong information because they
always saying them what will be because
they're afraid to say what this is
right i'm not going to feed you with
what it will be
uh okay again
my point being to create a channel of
internal communication between the team
that is working we are on this channel
right now michael we are on that channel
yes okay okay
exactly i'm not trying to hide any
information michael it's just that there
is an uncertainty because there are
complicated technical solutions which
which delivery is uncertain
so i cannot be more precise but i
completely understand that that's all
you
i'm very i was very transparent on this
call i just said exactly the status is
where we are right now
and what my predictions currently are
about where you know how
approximately what effort is required to
finish this or that
but i cannot be more precise than that
sorry
okay
all right evan you've got your hand
raised
do you still have a question
yeah there are another question from
community it's pretty short uh how was
the bosch status and uh
there is a person who was trying to to
use the brush contracts and he failed
and uh what what should he do and uh
because he thinks that that word that
doesn't work so okay if he's updated
with status
what what was what has been done i think
he already answered this one right
i did i did but i ivan is is you know is
this type of person
where um
he loves just just this type of
provocations
and the the point is that ivan is under
mda and he cannot talk about gosh
[Laughter]
how about that ivan so he
he like he tries to
to to make me talk about gosh
because he is under nda okay i just
don't know i just don't know what what
information should i
kind of talk and well you are
under nda which means no information
no information whatsoever
how the open source solution is feeling
right now and what factors what's your
solution feels great as usual it's just
unbelievably great
i mean
when as i said in the beginning when
there will be time for pr there will be
a pr right now no comments on gosh
that's not
the public if you are i mean you can you
know you can do and there is a
repository you can do you can try and if
for you it doesn't work then
sorry about that
yeah that's it that's what i wanted to
keep
okay we have one last question before we
jump into some juicy bits um and i think
maybe
alexander could
maybe you know a bit about this because
they're asking when open ever foundation
when is that starting thinking about
opening ever foundation question mark
why
don't open ever foundation
so asking about the ever foundation the
foundation that uh
defy alliance i think
was
planning to start um
alex as
us
if you're still there
do you want to jump in here
yeah
i'm not sure i have much to comment on
the point
yeah i think yeah i think yeah you're in
a better position to talk about it i
know there are plans but not i don't
know details yeah
so would you fire lions and well hi
everybody first of all defy lines and
nevrex working together to do it's not
ever but ever scale foundation
the idea is that uh it would be some
sort of let's call it the face of the
project we're obviously decentralized
community but sometimes we need a face
for like exchanges and some other
entities that
of course like decentralized
organizations but still need somebody to
talk to so it's going to be swiss-based
there is some progress there is a lot of
legal work that has already been done
there are some members uh some
some candidates to join uh to join the
everscale foundation from the i would
say active reputable members
but i would probably stop it there and
i will present it properly once it's
launched just before its launch
but
i gave you the idea timing wise
let's give it a couple of more months
maybe realistically speaking
so not so soon but relatively soon
is the answer
okay that sounds very interesting
thank you alex
i hope that answered part of your
question um
there was another one that snuck up um
of kenny's asking if there's any update
about never stablecoin
is anybody you can jump in about that
one
yeah sure it's a contest going on and
the work isn't like we're not doing that
it's it's several other teams doing that
i think but the work is in progress
the
the date is may something i don't
remember exactly date but there is a
beginning of may
the delivery the end of the contest for
never ever stable coin we are assisting
whoever came to us and asked for
assistance on this because
never is a is a currency collection coin
so we did
and we did start in special network
where currency collection coin is
presented
um so people can debug on that network
uh their solution
and
the only team who asked us to do that
was prevented so we did it and
they are debugging but if you need
this network we can you know give you if
you're working on the solution for this
contest we can give you access to this
network to test your solution against
the currency correction implementation
[Music]
cool thank you micha um is there a chat
group
any specific telegram group or uh
defy uh
sub governance i think okay
point people that way cool thank you so
now we can get into the
juiciness and it's the best way to
end the call on a good note and reliably
that's of course with ben and his
i don't want hr to come after me so you
know his bits his super duper bits
we have hatred hey john
yeah what's he doing here i'm more
disappointed you didn't write me a poem
joke i was i was getting quite used to
run rising a poem every week i know he
was making me feel special yeah some
background no i joke i just think he's
awesome today joe i'm gonna keep this
really
really short guys uh just because we're
running late um
basically i'm getting a lot of my bits
from the twitter this week because alex
has been doing such a good job like
everything really exciting which has
been going on is on there so
just skimming through 76 million dollars
of tvl on flat cube
listings exchange listings hot bits and
there was also sushi swap i've seen this
morning you can get everyone's sushi
swap now what what week honestly um
there's videos about wallets there's all
sorts of stuff go go on the twitter go
on the news channel there's loads and
loads and loads and so much i could
literally talk for 20 minutes about it
but there's two things i want to show
you or talk to you about
um like i say
my little
side of things and in terms of uh
linking to what alex was saying about um
the idea of influencer and youtube
marketing you know it's not all about
getting outside people to come in and do
the work you know we're all here we're
all lovely charismatic people i like to
think i can talk so
you know myself and anastasia who works
with very closely with alex amongst
others in the overx team um have been
doing a kind of three times a week
review of the overall industry news uh
it's called never mind the rumor mill
it's all still on the same podcast feed
but really seriously like if if you've
not been helping out and checking to
support it we really do you know it's
all about beating the algorithms in the
outset and because it's non
specific to everscale it has wide appeal
but also sticks you know what we're
doing under the faces of the people who
are interested in what we're doing so
you know help me help you help
yourselves and go out there watch it
like it subscribe it you know there's
literally i've put this together so
there's no easier way for you to find
out all the crypto news that's gone on
you know three times a week boom
what more can you ask for come on please
uh the other thing i wanted to show you
uh despite pulling on your heart strings
i found the video about earlier so joe
if you could just give me a thumbs up uh
when this appears on the screen

worth it folks
