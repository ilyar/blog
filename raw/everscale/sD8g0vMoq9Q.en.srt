if
 

333
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,710
if
if you're building a crypto asset uh the

334

345
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,830
payment i think that's still a long way
to go so cryptos are commodities here

there's 200 registered
 

439
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,110
there's 200 registered
exchanges right so i the key thing to

440
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120
exchanges right so i the key thing to
 

441
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,110
exchanges right so i the key thing to
kind of bear in mind is like regulations

442
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
kind of bear in mind is like regulations
 

443
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,029
kind of bear in mind is like regulations
develop slightly differently from market

444
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
develop slightly differently from market
 

445
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,350
develop slightly differently from market
to market country to country so their

446
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
to market country to country so their
 

447
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,270
to market country to country so their

448
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
continues to evolve
 

449
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,189
continues to evolve
so what does it mean to be one of the 20

450
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
so what does it mean to be one of the 20
 

451
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,909
so what does it mean to be one of the 20
registered and one of the 13 regulated

452
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:15,919
registered and one of the 13 regulated
 

453
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,469
registered and one of the 13 regulated
or you know ones so

454
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
or you know ones so
 

455
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,710
or you know ones so
what we see is for example and i think

456
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
what we see is for example and i think
 

457
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,070
what we see is for example and i think
for the audience here you know many of

458
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
for the audience here you know many of
 

459
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,790
for the audience here you know many of
us are not indonesian based in indonesia

460
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
us are not indonesian based in indonesia
 

461
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,150
us are not indonesian based in indonesia
maybe you don't have a key task maybe

462
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
maybe you don't have a key task maybe
 

463
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,070
maybe you don't have a key task maybe
you don't have

464
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
you don't have
 

465
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,150
you don't have
maybe you don't have a bank account

466
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
maybe you don't have a bank account
 

467
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,630
maybe you don't have a bank account
so some of these exchanges the 13 allow

468
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
so some of these exchanges the 13 allow
 

469
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,269
so some of these exchanges the 13 allow

473
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,430
investor
some of them don't so what is and this

474
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
some of them don't so what is and this
 

475
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,430
some of them don't so what is and this
is not something unique to indonesia

476
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
is not something unique to indonesia
 

477
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,190
is not something unique to indonesia
many markets have

478
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,200
many markets have
 

479
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,030
many markets have
what i would call like fluid regulations

480
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
what i would call like fluid regulations
 

481
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,790
what i would call like fluid regulations
so it is up to the exchanges to kind of

482
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
so it is up to the exchanges to kind of
 

483
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,310
so it is up to the exchanges to kind of
come up with the policies to be able to

484
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,320
come up with the policies to be able to
 

485
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,070
come up with the policies to be able to
satisfy the regulators

486
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
satisfy the regulators
 

487
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,949
satisfy the regulators
and

488
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
and
 

489
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,550
and
i think for many of us who are probably

490
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
i think for many of us who are probably
 

491
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,710
i think for many of us who are probably
in this room working on projects

492
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
in this room working on projects
 

493
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,030
in this room working on projects
the fact that crypto is categorized as a

494
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,040
the fact that crypto is categorized as a
 

495
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,550
the fact that crypto is categorized as a
commodity in indonesia is probably

496
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
commodity in indonesia is probably
 

497
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,389
commodity in indonesia is probably
something fairly interesting because

498
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
something fairly interesting because
 

499
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,509
something fairly interesting because
there are different

500
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
there are different
 

501
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,590
there are different
laws and prescriptions to that

502
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
laws and prescriptions to that
 

503
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,870
laws and prescriptions to that
as opposed to other markets where

504
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
as opposed to other markets where
 

505
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,710
as opposed to other markets where
they're treated as securities

506
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
they're treated as securities
 

507
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,430
they're treated as securities
so

508
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
so
 

509
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,509
so
my general advice and our experience so

510
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
my general advice and our experience so
 

511
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,030
my general advice and our experience so
far has been you should work closely

512
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
far has been you should work closely
 

513
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,710

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,070
they are typically the ones that
interface a lot with bubble pepti so

518
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
interface a lot with bubble pepti so

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,910
interface a lot with bubble pepti so
that you can know whether your project

520
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
that you can know whether your project
 

521
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,230
that you can know whether your project
has to be in the regulated space or it

522
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
has to be in the regulated space or it
 

523
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,350
has to be in the regulated space or it
can remain unregulated for like for for

00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
can remain unregulated for like for for
 

525
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,990
can remain unregulated for like for for
example daos and nfts are largely not

example daos and nfts are largely not
 

527
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,630
example daos and nfts are largely not
regulated in indonesia and so that's a

528
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
regulated in indonesia and so that's a
 

529
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,150
regulated in indonesia and so that's a
it's an unclear treatment but i guess to

530
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
it's an unclear treatment but i guess to
 

531
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,590
it's an unclear treatment but i guess to
the benefit of the industry right you

532
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
the benefit of the industry right you
 

533
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,150
the benefit of the industry right you
can still do how you want to do it until

a future point where they have clearer
regulations

when it comes to regulations and
the crypto space

544
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
the crypto space
 

545

as as an entrepreneur
sometimes you

548
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
sometimes you
 

549
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,269
sometimes you
have this

550
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
have this
 

551
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,949
have this
sense of okay let's just go ahead and

552
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
sense of okay let's just go ahead and
 

553
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,870
sense of okay let's just go ahead and
build it and do it

554
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880

 

555
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,069

while in hot pursuit of the regulators

556
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,079
while in hot pursuit of the regulators
 

557
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,750
while in hot pursuit of the regulators
so they will be very closely watching

558
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:03,760
so they will be very closely watching
 

559
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,870
so they will be very closely watching
but in some instances i feel

560
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880
but in some instances i feel
 

561
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,910
but in some instances i feel
that

562
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
that
 

563
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,870
that
that growth needs to occur

564
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:10,880
that growth needs to occur
 

565
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,590
that growth needs to occur
before the regulators

566
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
before the regulators
 

567
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,030
before the regulators
are aware of what

568
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
are aware of what
 

569
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,269
are aware of what
regulations they need to put in place

570
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279
regulations they need to put in place
 

571
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,550
regulations they need to put in place
so sometimes you need that

572
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
so sometimes you need that
 

573
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,630
so sometimes you need that
spark and you need that guts

574
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
spark and you need that guts
 

575
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,269
spark and you need that guts
and risk taking to

576
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
and risk taking to
 

577
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,030
and risk taking to
build and cultivate new products and

regulated here
 

583
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,870
regulated here
in order to bring the issue to light for

584
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
in order to bring the issue to light for
 

585
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,110
in order to bring the issue to light for
the regulators to come in and

586
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
the regulators to come in and
 

587
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,750
the regulators to come in and
provide some governance

00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
provide some governance
 

589
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,990
provide some governance
yeah yeah i agree with that uh basically

590
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
yeah yeah i agree with that uh basically
 

591
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,389
yeah yeah i agree with that uh basically
regulators have to come in uh place in

592
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
regulators have to come in uh place in
 

593
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,069
regulators have to come in uh place in
this in this scene

594
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:44,079
this in this scene
 

595
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,110
this in this scene
basically

596
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
basically
 

597
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,350
basically
um as you you all know that

598
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
um as you you all know that
 

599
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,190
um as you you all know that
the government is actually creating the

600
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
the government is actually creating the
 

601
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,910
the government is actually creating the
official exchanges that will

602
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
official exchanges that will
 

603
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,509
official exchanges that will
um aggregate all of other exchanges uh i

604
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
um aggregate all of other exchanges uh i
 

605
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,030
um aggregate all of other exchanges uh i
think there are 17 exchanges in

606
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
think there are 17 exchanges in
 

607
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,230
think there are 17 exchanges in
indonesia

608
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
indonesia
 

609
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,430
indonesia
and

610
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
and
 

611
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,269
and
yeah speaking of blockchain i think uh

612
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279
yeah speaking of blockchain i think uh
 

613
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,230
yeah speaking of blockchain i think uh
well

614
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
well
 

615
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,910

think that's a that's a good sign for

622
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
think that's a that's a good sign for
 

623
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,790
think that's a that's a good sign for
indonesia especially

624
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
indonesia especially
 

625
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,790
indonesia especially
uh when we when we talk about crypto

626
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
uh when we when we talk about crypto
 

627
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,790
uh when we when we talk about crypto
right it's more than just transactions

628
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:18,800
right it's more than just transactions
 

629
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,630
right it's more than just transactions
crypto and blockchains more than just

630
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
crypto and blockchains more than just
 

631
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,069
crypto and blockchains more than just
transactions i think

632
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:22,079
transactions i think
 

633
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,470
transactions i think
smart contracts and dows can play a very

00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
smart contracts and dows can play a very
 

635
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,069
smart contracts and dows can play a very

well we can see that in indonesia
 

651
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,630
well we can see that in indonesia
there are about new close close to 300

652
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:46,640
there are about new close close to 300
 

653
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,470
there are about new close close to 300
million populations uh 276 to be exact

654
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
million populations uh 276 to be exact
 

655
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,590
million populations uh 276 to be exact
and 60 of them are actually

656
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,600
and 60 of them are actually
 

657
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,470
and 60 of them are actually
uh genji and millennials so basically

658
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
uh genji and millennials so basically
 

659
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,430
uh genji and millennials so basically
they are

660
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
they are
 

661
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,310
they are
people under 40 40 years old and the

662
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
people under 40 40 years old and the
 

663
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,990
people under 40 40 years old and the
potential is huge

664
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000
potential is huge
 

665
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,310
potential is huge
and i think in the future

666
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
and i think in the future
 

667
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,990
and i think in the future
web3 will be

668
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
web3 will be
 

669
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,310
web3 will be
will be very important part

670
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
will be very important part
 

671
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,030
will be very important part
in in this industry basically it's about

672
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
in in this industry basically it's about
 

673
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,870
in in this industry basically it's about
empowerment it's about giving back to

674
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
empowerment it's about giving back to
 

675
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,310
empowerment it's about giving back to
the people it's about giving back to the

676
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
the people it's about giving back to the
 

677
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,670
the people it's about giving back to the
community right

678
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
community right
 

679
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,030
community right
and um well i think a combination of

680
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
and um well i think a combination of
 

681
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,629
and um well i think a combination of
web3 and green energy will be uh we

682
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639
web3 and green energy will be uh we
 

683
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,389
web3 and green energy will be uh we
should look look out that that will be

684
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:24,399
should look look out that that will be
 

685
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,710
should look look out that that will be
the the next big thing in blockchain i

686
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
the the next big thing in blockchain i
 

687
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,949
the the next big thing in blockchain i
think uh give providing rewards to

688
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
think uh give providing rewards to
 

689
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,269
think uh give providing rewards to

into rupiah in their bank account anyway

864
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
into rupiah in their bank account anyway
 

865
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,189
into rupiah in their bank account anyway
right um i think there's also another

866
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:03,199
right um i think there's also another
 

867
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,150
right um i think there's also another
exchange called zipmex that has created

868
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
exchange called zipmex that has created
 

869
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,189
exchange called zipmex that has created
a

870
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:07,199
a
 

871
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,629
a
a visa

872
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
a visa
 

873
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,710
a visa
debit card so people can use the crypto

874
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:10,720
debit card so people can use the crypto
 

875
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,990
debit card so people can use the crypto
assets in exchange for everyday payments

876
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,000
assets in exchange for everyday payments
 

877
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,710
assets in exchange for everyday payments
so

878
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:14,720
so
 

879
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,430
so
i would have to say now um yeah still

880
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440
i would have to say now um yeah still
 

881
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,829
i would have to say now um yeah still
long way to go and it's not uh it's not

882
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
long way to go and it's not uh it's not
 

883
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,629
long way to go and it's not uh it's not
an urgent thing i think it will become

884
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:22,639
an urgent thing i think it will become
 

885
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,670
an urgent thing i think it will become
more urgent as more and more uh of

886
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
more urgent as more and more uh of
 

887
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,670
more urgent as more and more uh of
indonesia's trade partners

888
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
indonesia's trade partners
 

889
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,269
indonesia's trade partners
um kind of enforce the use of

890
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:31,279
um kind of enforce the use of
 

891
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,949
um kind of enforce the use of
stable coins for

892
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
stable coins for
 

893
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,350
stable coins for
for everyday trades and export import

894
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
for everyday trades and export import
 

895
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,870
for everyday trades and export import
yeah um

896
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
yeah um
 

897
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,470
yeah um
i think there's a distinction between

898
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
i think there's a distinction between
 

899
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,629
i think there's a distinction between
cbdc's and stable coins right they sell

900
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:42,639
cbdc's and stable coins right they sell
 

901
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,230
cbdc's and stable coins right they sell
different purposes and obviously the

902
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240
different purposes and obviously the
 

903
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,430
different purposes and obviously the
authority that governs them are

904
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:45,440
authority that governs them are
 

905
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,269
authority that governs them are
different in indonesia they already have

906
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:47,279
different in indonesia they already have
 

907
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,790
different in indonesia they already have
a few private stablecoin projects like

908
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:48,800
a few private stablecoin projects like

um

912
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:52,399
um
 

913
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,710
um
but i i think as a panelist has shared a

914
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:54,720
but i i think as a panelist has shared a
 

915
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,590
but i i think as a panelist has shared a
lot of

916
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600
lot of
 

917
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,110
lot of
the larger

918
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120

ticket size investors typically will buy

920
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,360
ticket size investors typically will buy
 

921
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,350
ticket size investors typically will buy
stablecoin first and i think this is

922
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,360
stablecoin first and i think this is
 

923
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,629
stablecoin first and i think this is
where we need to make a distinction of

924
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:02,639
where we need to make a distinction of
 

925
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,990
where we need to make a distinction of
like why they're buying stable coins

926
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,000
like why they're buying stable coins
 

927
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,429
like why they're buying stable coins
they're not buying it because they want

928
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
they're not buying it because they want
 

929
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,270
they're not buying it because they want
to keep it in usdt or idrt or just a

930
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:09,280
to keep it in usdt or idrt or just a
 

931
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,230
to keep it in usdt or idrt or just a
stablecoin i mean even with base landing

932
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,240
stablecoin i mean even with base landing

939
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,990

is going to go in in a stable coin so

940
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,000
is going to go in in a stable coin so
 

941
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,429
is going to go in in a stable coin so
it's because stable coins are the

942
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
it's because stable coins are the
 

943
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,270
it's because stable coins are the
natural on-ramp that they need right

but for a country like indonesia the

but for a country like indonesia the

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,950
but for a country like indonesia the
concern around building a stable coin is

956
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
concern around building a stable coin is
 

957
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,230
concern around building a stable coin is
very different than a country like the

958
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
very different than a country like the
 

959
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,190
very different than a country like the

malaysian ringgate or filipino peso are
 

971
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,230
malaysian ringgate or filipino peso are
typically what's considered as

972
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
typically what's considered as
 

973
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,310
typically what's considered as

surrounding monetary policy of these

976
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
surrounding monetary policy of these
 

977
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,909
surrounding monetary policy of these
countries are such that they want to

countries are such that they want to
minimize capital flight

980
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
minimize capital flight
 

981
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,590
minimize capital flight
so a lot more of the rupiah should be

982
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:57,600
so a lot more of the rupiah should be
 

983
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,430
so a lot more of the rupiah should be
spent on shore in indonesia and as

984
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,440
spent on shore in indonesia and as
 

985
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,430
spent on shore in indonesia and as
everyone just touched on this now

986
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,440
everyone just touched on this now
 

987
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,350
everyone just touched on this now
many of the things to do with how can

988
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
many of the things to do with how can
 

989
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,430
many of the things to do with how can
you spend your rupiah in crypto it's

990
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:05,440
you spend your rupiah in crypto it's
 

991
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,909
you spend your rupiah in crypto it's
already you know fairly well served with

992
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:07,919
already you know fairly well served with
 

993
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,470
already you know fairly well served with
on-ramps with payment gateways and and

994
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
on-ramps with payment gateways and and
 

995
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,150
on-ramps with payment gateways and and
of course like some innovations like

996
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,160
of course like some innovations like
 

997
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,230
of course like some innovations like
spending it through your card so i find

998
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,240
spending it through your card so i find
 

999
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,950
spending it through your card so i find
it quite hard for a government to um to

1000
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
it quite hard for a government to um to
 

1001
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,350
it quite hard for a government to um to
introduce a cbdc that has more value add

1002
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,360
introduce a cbdc that has more value add
 

1003
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,430
introduce a cbdc that has more value add
than i think some of the utility that

1004
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
than i think some of the utility that
 

1005
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,750
than i think some of the utility that
some stable coins can already do

1006
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,760
some stable coins can already do
 

1007
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,830
some stable coins can already do
the the consideration for a country to

1008
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
the the consideration for a country to
 

1009
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,669
the the consideration for a country to
really open up the currency through a

1010
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
really open up the currency through a
 

1011
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,870
really open up the currency through a
cbdc

1012
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
cbdc
 

1013
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,669
cbdc
probably has much more risk than what's

1014
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
probably has much more risk than what's
 

1015
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,830
probably has much more risk than what's
obvious to us when we're in web 3 and

1016
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
obvious to us when we're in web 3 and
 

1017
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,830
obvious to us when we're in web 3 and
crypto right it's it's really around

1018
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:35,840
crypto right it's it's really around
 

1019
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,390
crypto right it's it's really around
monetary expansion policies and these

1020
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
monetary expansion policies and these
 

1021
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,190
monetary expansion policies and these
are

1022
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200
are
 

1023
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,710
are
fairly difficult conversations that they

1024
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
fairly difficult conversations that they
 

1025
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,990
fairly difficult conversations that they
have on the national and international

1026
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,000
have on the national and international

level
 

1029
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,630
level
that i'm not sure that the interest of

what would be a game changer maybe in
 

1349
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,110
what would be a game changer maybe in
the next uh one to two years

1350
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,120
the next uh one to two years
 

1351
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,070
the next uh one to two years
is actually the initiative of uh

1352
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
is actually the initiative of uh
 

1353
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,310
is actually the initiative of uh
babti the commodities regulator

1354
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,320
babti the commodities regulator

babti the commodities regulator
to establish um a clearing exchange

1356
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,200
to establish um a clearing exchange
 

1357
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,230
to establish um a clearing exchange
so

1358
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,240
so
 

1359
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,470
so
how this clearing exchange works is uh

1360
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:04,480
how this clearing exchange works is uh
 

1361
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,830
how this clearing exchange works is uh
it would become

1362
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:05,840
it would become
 

1363
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,669
it would become
the liquidity insurer for the 18 crypto

1364
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:09,679
the liquidity insurer for the 18 crypto
 

1365

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,269
exchanges that is registered
um so

1368
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:13,279
um so
 

1369
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,990
um so
these uh 18 crypto exchanges they have

exchanges go to fault
 

1383
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,789
exchanges go to fault
um i think

1384
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:30,799
um i think
 

1385
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,909
um i think
with that initiative um i think more and

1386
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:33,919
with that initiative um i think more and
 

1387
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,710
with that initiative um i think more and
more uh traditional fund companies will

1388
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:36,720
more uh traditional fund companies will
 

1389
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,310
more uh traditional fund companies will
uh allocate more and

1390
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,320
uh allocate more and
 

1391
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,149
uh allocate more and
more of their portfolio into crypto

1392
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:40,159
more of their portfolio into crypto
 

1393
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,630
more of their portfolio into crypto
especially uh the blue chips uh bitcoin

1397
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,029
ethereum
i think um

1398
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:45,039
i think um
 

1399
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,950
i think um
they're i'm seeing a lot of initiatives

1400
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:46,960
they're i'm seeing a lot of initiatives
 

1401
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,269
they're i'm seeing a lot of initiatives
as well from crypto communities

1402
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:49,279
as well from crypto communities
 

1403
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,230
as well from crypto communities
to

1404
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:50,240
to
 

1405
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,190
to
um educate uh their members

um educate uh their members
 

1407
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,630
um educate uh their members
about how bitcoin is basically a digital

um yeah that that could happen uh in the

1416
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:06,480
um yeah that that could happen uh in the
 

1417
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,470
um yeah that that could happen uh in the
next one or two years as it becomes more

1418
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:08,480
next one or two years as it becomes more
 

1419

that space since like 2011

1430
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:20,880
that space since like 2011
 

1431
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,630
that space since like 2011
and it's kind of funny that in 2022 we

1432
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:22,640
and it's kind of funny that in 2022 we
 

1433
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,830
and it's kind of funny that in 2022 we
talk about crypto vcs as if these tech

1434
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:25,840
talk about crypto vcs as if these tech
 

1435
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,350
talk about crypto vcs as if these tech
companies which are building in web 3

1436
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:27,360
companies which are building in web 3
 

1437
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,070
companies which are building in web 3
and crypto are like typical

1438
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,080
and crypto are like typical
 

1439
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,070
and crypto are like typical
tech companies because they're not right

1440
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,080
tech companies because they're not right
 

1441
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,669
tech companies because they're not right
you know in the tradit i guess if you

1442
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:33,679
you know in the tradit i guess if you
 

1443
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,070
you know in the tradit i guess if you
call it the traditional vc space you

1444
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,080
call it the traditional vc space you
 

1445
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,110
call it the traditional vc space you
have your precede seat series a b all

1446
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:39,120
have your precede seat series a b all
 

1447
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,110
have your precede seat series a b all
goes up towards an ipo or some sort of

1448
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,120
goes up towards an ipo or some sort of
 

1449
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,310
goes up towards an ipo or some sort of
acquisition

1450
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,320
acquisition
 

1451
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,710
acquisition
whereas in crypto you have you can have

1452
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:44,720
whereas in crypto you have you can have
 

1453
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,789
whereas in crypto you have you can have
in many cases immediate or fairly

1454
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:46,799
in many cases immediate or fairly
 

1455
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,909
in many cases immediate or fairly
short-term

1456
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:47,919
short-term
 

1457
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,789
short-term
um horizon to ultimately liquidity right

1458
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:50,799
um horizon to ultimately liquidity right
 

1459
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,950
um horizon to ultimately liquidity right
especially to a crypto to crypto market

1460
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:52,960
especially to a crypto to crypto market
 

1461
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,990
especially to a crypto to crypto market
so

1462
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,000
so
 

1463
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,830
so
if you look back in like 2016 2017

1464
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:55,840
if you look back in like 2016 2017
 

1465
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,430
if you look back in like 2016 2017
nobody was talking about early stage

1466
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:57,440
nobody was talking about early stage
 

1467
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,269
nobody was talking about early stage
incubators or vc funds and all that

1468
00:26:59,269 --> 00:26:59,279
incubators or vc funds and all that
 

1469
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,549
incubators or vc funds and all that
everyone's like you know go to market

1470
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:00,559
everyone's like you know go to market
 

1471
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,950
everyone's like you know go to market
ico and of course many things have

1472
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:02,960
ico and of course many things have
 

1473
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,549
ico and of course many things have
happened from there i'm sure

1474
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:04,559
happened from there i'm sure
 

1475
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,870
happened from there i'm sure
i'm also a recovering dj so i've

1476
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:06,880
i'm also a recovering dj so i've
 

1477
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,470
i'm also a recovering dj so i've
probably also lost a bit of money in the

1478
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:08,480
probably also lost a bit of money in the
 

1479
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,149
probably also lost a bit of money in the
2016-2017

1480
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:10,159
2016-2017
 

1481
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,390
2016-2017
ico boom but my point being like the

1482
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:12,400
ico boom but my point being like the
 

1483
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,750
ico boom but my point being like the
rules of the game don't have to be the

1484
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:13,760
rules of the game don't have to be the
 

1485
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,390
rules of the game don't have to be the
same as how you have with your tradition

1486
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:16,400
same as how you have with your tradition
 

1487
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,510
same as how you have with your tradition
i guess you call it relatively

1488
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:17,520
i guess you call it relatively
 

1489
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,710
i guess you call it relatively
traditional tech growth strategies

1490
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:20,720
traditional tech growth strategies
 

1491
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,510
traditional tech growth strategies
so

1492
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:21,520
so
 

1493
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,750
so
when you take that into account

1494
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:23,760
when you take that into account
 

1495
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,110
when you take that into account
the question that everybody asks like

1496
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,120
the question that everybody asks like
 

1497
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,630
the question that everybody asks like
how much of a pe or vc portfolio of

1498
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:28,640
how much of a pe or vc portfolio of
 

1499
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,870
how much of a pe or vc portfolio of
funds allocating into crypto i think the

1500
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:30,880
funds allocating into crypto i think the
 

1501
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,310
funds allocating into crypto i think the
natural answer should be zero percent

1502
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:32,320
natural answer should be zero percent
 

1503
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,149
natural answer should be zero percent
because they don't have to play by the

1504
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:34,159
because they don't have to play by the
 

1505
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,269
because they don't have to play by the
same rules

1506
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:35,279
same rules
 

1507
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,190
same rules
you look at the terms of a typical vc

1508
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:37,200
you look at the terms of a typical vc
 

1509
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,950
you look at the terms of a typical vc
fund right it's an eight-year lock-up if

1511
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,350

you're a limited partner and you give my

00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:41,360
you're a limited partner and you give my
 

1513
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,110
you're a limited partner and you give my
vc fund like 10 million dollars you'll

1514
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,120
vc fund like 10 million dollars you'll
 

1515
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,950
vc fund like 10 million dollars you'll
never see that back for eight years if i

1516
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:44,960
never see that back for eight years if i
 

1517
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,549
never see that back for eight years if i
use a model like european waterfall

1518
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:46,559
use a model like european waterfall
 

1519
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,310
use a model like european waterfall
you'll never see it back until i recover

1520
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,320
you'll never see it back until i recover
 

1521
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,190
you'll never see it back until i recover

2013
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,310

sun energy and then they combine

2014
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:32,320
sun energy and then they combine
 

2015
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,109
sun energy and then they combine
together with water is very

2016
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:35,119
together with water is very
 

2017
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,829
together with water is very
fantastic and they can

2018
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:37,839
fantastic and they can
 

2019
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,910
fantastic and they can
reduce almost 60 to 80 percent

2020
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:41,920
reduce almost 60 to 80 percent

are 100 behind blockchain
right um so i think that's that's where

2362
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:49,040
right um so i think that's that's where
 

2363
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,390
right um so i think that's that's where
it's difficult

2364
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:50,400
it's difficult
 

2365
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,390
it's difficult
so my short term bet in the next three

2366
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:52,400
so my short term bet in the next three
 

2367
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,190
so my short term bet in the next three
five years is that play to earn you know

2368
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:55,200
five years is that play to earn you know
 

2369
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,470
five years is that play to earn you know

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,069
this to earn kind of ecosystems will do
very well

2376
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:02,079
very well
 

2377
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,910
very well
but i'm conflicted because personally i

2378
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:03,920
but i'm conflicted because personally i
 

2379
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,790
but i'm conflicted because personally i
don't think that that's the most

2380
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:04,800
don't think that that's the most
 

2381
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,470
don't think that that's the most
important things that we have to solve

2382
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:06,480

2384
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:07,280
right
 

2385
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:07,990
right
so

2386
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:08,000
so
 

2387
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,190
so
i guess time will tell um and and

2388
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:11,200
i guess time will tell um and and
 

2389
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,790
i guess time will tell um and and
and i think in closing like

2390
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:12,800
and i think in closing like
 

2391
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,710
and i think in closing like
