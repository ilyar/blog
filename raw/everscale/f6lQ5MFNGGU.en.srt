relatively speaking, we
 

1835
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,330
relatively speaking, we
spent a lot of time on, let's

1836
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:33,340
spent a lot of time on, let's
 

1837
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:35,189
spent a lot of time on, let's
say, finalizing the understanding of how

in general; firstly, we introduced such a

01:18:41,339 --> 01:18:41,349
in general; firstly, we introduced such a
 

1843
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:43,620
in general; firstly, we introduced such a
new instance, called a manager, that

new instance, called a manager, that
 

1845

is, in addition to the UN rodok,
 

1847
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:49,439
is, in addition to the UN rodok,
we have a manager, a manager, this is a temporary

we have a manager, a manager, this is a temporary

that after some time he
loses these Jews these powers and then

manager of the token can be, for example, an
 

1865
01:19:10,429 --> 01:19:11,680
manager of the token can be, for example, an

following, we delegate the addresses of the tokens
 

1887
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:47,140
following, we delegate the addresses of the tokens
based on the ID of the token in the hand and plus the

based on the ID of the token in the hand and plus the

address  root what follows this what it
gives this gives that we can calculate the

1892
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:54,800
gives this gives that we can calculate the
 

1893
01:19:54,800 --> 01:20:00,160
gives this gives that we can calculate the
address of the tokin without regard to the graph and

address of the tokin without regard to the graph and

01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:02,080
address of the tokin without regard to the graph and
we need graphics and to calculate this

01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:02,090
we need graphics and to calculate this
 

1897
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:04,209
we need graphics and to calculate this
address, that is, we can immediately count and

tickets, let’s start here as without
 

1941
01:20:54,530 --> 01:20:58,900

with tickets everything is more or less

with tickets everything is more or less
 

1945

1991
01:22:26,429 --> 01:22:28,580
tone, I bought myself one ticket and now I
will repeat the purchase again, that is, I

1992
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:28,590
will repeat the purchase again, that is, I
 

1993
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:32,600
will repeat the purchase again, that is, I
have ticket number 1, but I will return to the

main menu and buy the
 

1997
01:22:51,269 --> 01:23:00,669

now in a few seconds transactions will come

2000
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:03,570
now in a few seconds transactions will come
 

2001
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:07,339
now in a few seconds transactions will come
accordingly, I hope a transaction will come

accordingly, I hope a transaction will come
 

2003
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:10,910
accordingly, I hope a transaction will come
and it will tell me that I bought

2004
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:10,920
and it will tell me that I bought
 

2005
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:14,169
and it will tell me that I bought
which ticket of such and such a number and,

which ticket of such and such a number and,
 

2007
01:23:14,179 --> 01:23:21,259
which ticket of such and such a number and,
accordingly, give a few seconds already,

that is, you can sell tickets  and there, on
real tents, there are

real tents, there are
 

2041
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,810
real tents, there are
standing recumbent walk-through balconies next to the place

can always be superimposed on these pellets and there
 

2049
01:24:07,229 --> 01:24:10,129
can always be superimposed on these pellets and there
can be a rather complicated pricing logic there

01:24:10,129 --> 01:24:10,139
can be a rather complicated pricing logic there
 

2051
01:24:10,139 --> 01:24:11,330
can be a rather complicated pricing logic there

, that is, for example, a
 

2053
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:13,819
, that is, for example, a
fixed price, this price is

01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,620
determined at the last moment
, taking into account demand, and so on.  it’s

2058
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:17,630
, taking into account demand, and so on.  it’s
 

2059
01:24:17,630 --> 01:24:20,560
, taking into account demand, and so on.  it’s
all realizable and it’s very promising,

2060
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:20,570
all realizable and it’s very promising,
 

2061
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:22,959
all realizable and it’s very promising,
I’m focusing on this simply

2062
01:24:22,959 --> 01:24:22,969
I’m focusing on this simply
 

2063
01:24:22,969 --> 01:24:24,839
I’m focusing on this simply
because now she doesn’t associate these currents

2064
01:24:24,839 --> 01:24:24,849
because now she doesn’t associate these currents
 

2065
01:24:24,849 --> 01:24:27,490
because now she doesn’t associate these currents
with pictures, but the application

2066
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:27,500
with pictures, but the application
 

2067
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:30,189
with pictures, but the application
to these currents is much wider and much more

2068
01:24:30,189 --> 01:24:30,199
to these currents is much wider and much more
 

2069
01:24:30,199 --> 01:24:33,220
to these currents is much wider and much more
interesting, maybe let’s get back to the

2070
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:33,230
interesting, maybe let’s get back to the
 

2071
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:39,459
interesting, maybe let’s get back to the
pictures on the high club, that is, the start

2072
01:24:39,459 --> 01:24:39,469
pictures on the high club, that is, the start
 

2073
01:24:39,469 --> 01:24:40,649
pictures on the high club, that is, the start
page

2074

we don’t  we were working on, let’s say, a

2076
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:45,260
we don’t  we were working on, let’s say, a
 

2077
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:47,049
we don’t  we were working on, let’s say, a
large number of interfaces, we were now

2078
01:24:47,049 --> 01:24:47,059
large number of interfaces, we were now
 

2079
01:24:47,059 --> 01:24:48,939
large number of interfaces, we were now
engaged in more technological

2080
01:24:48,939 --> 01:24:48,949
engaged in more technological
 

2081
01:24:48,949 --> 01:24:50,950
engaged in more technological
things, and therefore it was important for us to

2082
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:50,960
things, and therefore it was important for us to
 

2083
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,080
things, and therefore it was important for us to
implement transactional things and

2084
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:53,090
implement transactional things and
 

2085
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:57,399
implement transactional things and
operational things, so there

2086
01:24:57,399 --> 01:24:57,409
operational things, so there
 

2087
01:24:57,409 --> 01:24:59,169
operational things, so there
will be much more interfaces, now we

2088
01:24:59,169 --> 01:24:59,179
will be much more interfaces, now we
 

2089
01:24:59,179 --> 01:25:01,930
will be much more interfaces, now we
have could you have these pages there, let’s say

2090
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:01,940
have could you have these pages there, let’s say
 

2091
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:05,500
have could you have these pages there, let’s say
activities, it’s clear that there will be

2092
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:05,510
activities, it’s clear that there will be
 

2093
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:08,649
activities, it’s clear that there will be
various operations there  transactions various

2094
01:25:08,649 --> 01:25:08,659
various operations there  transactions various
 

2095
01:25:08,659 --> 01:25:10,120
various operations there  transactions various
filter  we are on a transaction, that is, there is a

01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:10,130
filter  we are on a transaction, that is, there is a
 

2097
01:25:10,130 --> 01:25:12,549
filter  we are on a transaction, that is, there is a
creation of a sale, and so long ago, like

2098
01:25:12,549 --> 01:25:12,559
creation of a sale, and so long ago, like
 

2099
01:25:12,559 --> 01:25:15,459
creation of a sale, and so long ago, like
now, we just, within the framework of the competition again,
