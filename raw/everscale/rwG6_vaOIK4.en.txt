and also very hot here in the way yeah
like plus 41 or something yeah so
surviving
you're melting more like melting

you know time zones and i'm wondering if
he's still sleeping right now
let's give a few more minutes
was ben playing to join us this time or
not this time i asked him i'm just
picking him again now
and
lastly we need eugene he's presenting
mickey wakey

shake him out of bed and wake him up
i'm gonna give him a couple minutes and
maybe we can move
some things around
okay
anybody else cameras on
say hi to everybody
hey everyone
hi michael
hey michael
i was just thinking we probably should
have invited somebody from the define
lines to talk about the kind of effect
of the
um of the listings
which is obviously extremely significant
to tier one exchanges but um
i was going to do a brief update about
that um but i didn't get anybody from
defy who wanted to come on this week and
then we had two
two
two projects who um
wanted to postpone to next week so
i think it's just going to be a short
and sweet one today
hopefully eugene comes because we have
some
pretty cool stuff um on his side
uh
but
i'm gonna pin him as well yeah
well we could start
so welcome back everybody i hope you had
a refreshed uh holiday weekend for
anybody who is celebrating and we've had
some pretty exciting things happen over
the past week
as far as listings games and more go so
the team behind the listings is actually
doing a really amazing job i'm sure
everybody was really thrilled by the
announcement of ever finally being
listed on kucoin which is huge they're
one of the top five exchanges in the
world in terms of trading volume
um and the first pairing to be up is
ever in usdt
and with more to be rolled out in the
future as well
and also the main net integration will
happen at the end of this month i
believe which is
great and then hot off the hills of that
one we had another listing announced and
this time it was phobi which is one of
the top 10 exchanges so
great news everybody and um
i believe it was yesterday that who will
be well welcomed ever deposits
with plans to launch ever spot trading
for the paris ever in usdt which is
great so we're definitely on track to
reaching that
top 100 goal which is great
and this is a milestone for for a
community and it's also
a testament to all of the work that's
been going on and been done over the
past months from
rebranding
refocusing and gearing up marketing and
a lot more this is great so it's uh
congrats is
owed to
everybody everybody in the ecosystem and
thank you
um also in listing news we have our
resident meme coin spartacats which is
also the 10th d5 alliance grant
recipient and um they're announcing new
listings so you can get your paws on the
perd token which has been listed on two
decentralized exchanges there's pancake
swap and flat cube
and um
i also saw floating around in twitter
like there's
uh an advertisement outside of musk's
office or something like that
there's there's a video
um billboard advertisement did anybody
see something like that floating around
i'm not sure if that's real or not so i
and i didn't see it everything it is
it's real
it's real they put i think four
billboards next to the tesla's office in
the silicon valley oh for a billboard so
it wasn't a video i thought it was a
video because there were different
pictures and i was i was like trying to
see how many
boards yeah
that's awesome so we've got to get some
more information on that
um and see if that's actually having any
impact too because that would be really
cool i want to see what people what
conversations that is kicking off
i kind of thought that might have been a
dream because i didn't see it like
talked about in any of the chats and
it's it's crazy
so
we need um
the king king meowtis to come on and
tell us about what was going on there
uh so also tomorrow june 8th at 5 00 pm
cet we've got the killer whale
podcast they're holding a one-time only
event and presenting everlock on gosh
and this is supposed to be a closed
event it's a closed show for the whole
everscale community uh just overscale
apparently and the founding members of
the gosh blockchain will answer
questions about technology tokenomics
and the roadmap
and additionally this is a chance for
members of the everscale community to
earn gosh tokens for staking evers and
that's what's actually
everlock is what it means
so for more details um check out the
chats and of course mark your calendars
for tomorrow's show at 5 pm cet
i also noticed that there was a really
clever
really small but clever game that popped
up in um everscale's discord it's called
decrypt the seed phrase
and everyone knows that seed phrases are
really important around here and there
was a prize of um 500 ever i believe and
it's definitely a game worth checking
out so simple and really clever because
it also brings awareness to the
different types of ever wallets there
are ever ever scale wallets
um so basically the host publishes the
seed phrase of an ever wallet with a
certain amount of ever inside of it and
the phrase is
encrypted in a specific way and players
obviously need to decrypt it i didn't
actually see the game in action but
um if you're out there and you played
and you won something please let us know
reach out
talk about it in the chats um
because i want to know what was your
method in figuring out the algorithm
so i thought that was really clever and
you know unique game something really
cool going on the discord
chats and that's it from me on some
quick updates so we can move on to the
agenda i see eugene hasn't been able to
join yet so we've got him he's supposed
to talk to us about the
election tech report which is great news
but i'll push it after the nft museum
we've got
our own ivan kotanikov who's been pretty
much neck deep in the museum heritage
project and he actually recorded a video
which was also aired at the gba
conference a couple weeks ago so we have
a video here um
and i'll let us take a deeper look into
the project they're working on
which is called
meta history
and that was the first initiative in the
nft space actually supported by the
ukrainian government which is awesome so
i'm going to share my screen and show
this
video for everybody
so
let me know if the audio carries over i
wasn't able to test it before
can you see it in the let me know if you
can hear it

she's
quite quite advanced from the
ah i think i found it
all right
she got it
what i need a password for this
what
hold that
um okay last try
now
my name is ivan i'm from ukraine and for
almost 10 years working developing
software at big companies
now i switched to engineering leadership
and manage a few teams
together we contribute to the blockchain
ecosystem
this spring we launched the nfc platform
which gained public support from the
ukraine government this platform is
called med history
let me share why and how we made this
project and where we are now
millions of ukraine citizens had plans
for 2022 but they're all gone because of
the war
these people lost their jobs
home and future
since the russian invasion started we've
been
hiding in shelters with my family and
newborn daughter panzers drove our
streets and the shells flew over our
heads i was afraid
and when i look at the people around me
i wonder why they can't feel any fear
the answer was people were busy doing
something good some women were sealing
camouflage while others sorting
humanitarian aid somebody was cooking
and some children drawing pictures to
support the army everyone was busy
volunteering
so
we teamed up with leading experts in the
blockchain space to raise funds for
ukraine
a community of volunteers we've built
the meta history the platform for
digital art sales and options since day
one of the war
we collect and track twitter posts on
ukraine's topic we select the most
significant statements decisions and
actions of companies and governments
hundreds of artists do the artwork for
this chronicle we store it on the
blockchain so there is no way to destroy
hide or censor these records
this nft collection is called the
warline
meta history became the first initiative
in the nft space supported by the
government digital transformation
defense and culture departments posted
about us
100 proceeds from the warline sales and
auctions go to the official crypto
wallace of ukraine as of now we have
raised almost 1 million dollars
we fight for justice democracy freedom
and life
but the people keep dying
some of our cities and villages have
been wiped off the face of the earth and
their houses and all infrastructure have
been destroyed the tragedy of
marijuana as of stall butcher and
barajanka broke the hearts of all
ukrainian people
it's impossible to stay away from the
cruelty that we face
the purpose of meta history is to
contribute to ukraine's renovation after
the war for the last couple of years
ukraine was developing innovative
digital components to improve the
security efficiency and throughput of
the governance infrastructure we call it
government in the smartphone is an
example there is an official mobile app
that holds your id in a digital form and
provides instant access to a lot of
administrative services
but there are still a lot of challenges
in this space one such challenge is the
ability to vote without leaving home
for decades the anonymous voting
protocol was being a subject of research
and has never been implemented before
now
in today's art show you will give it the
first test
the complicated cryptography behind this
solution makes it suitable for using
real elections but today instead of
candidates there will be nfts
the meta history team has submitted 40
pieces for this vote
10 of those are pixel art pieces drawn
by 9 year old ukrainian refugee david he
and his family were lucky to escape
before their flat got damaged
and 30
are illustrated tweets from the second
week of the war taken from the meta
history warline ukraine is a great
example of a country where the
government adopts cutting-edge
technologies to better our society
i'm a proud citizen of ukraine and i
respectfully ask you to check out the
med history webpage subscribe like share
tweet retweet and support ukraine
okay what do you guys think of the video
i think it's both
heartbreaking and heart warming it's a
huge initiative um all at the same time
and it's
uh conflicting ultimately there
shouldn't be a need for such a thing but
unfortunately there is and
uh
now we have people from all over the
world contributing and helping and
already they have about one million
dollars
uh i i guess for renovations um
1.5 1.5 for now because we
recently sold the eurovision first prize
won by
uh ukrainian artists and uh this is a
entity of this
like microphone which which he won on
eurovision and also some like exclusive
recordings and
like delivered to
uh to one of the ukrainian exchanges who
participated in auction and they they
bought it for 900
000 wow
yeah so so we are now
almost on two million points
that's that's amazing and that's that's
thanks to this project that you guys
have been working so hard on
um
so thank you ivan and the whole museum
heritage team for your dedication and of
course sharing your project with us
this is
it's huge
um and i look forward to seeing
how it
helps how can help and spread more
awareness
does anybody want to
say anything or do you have any
questions
maybe there are questions in the chats
okay um
i haven't seen any questions on youtube
no so i think
if anybody else had any questions um
i want to jump in
did you join respond or no i i think
he's he's sleeping
um
okay let's keep it short and sweet then
yeah yeah actually we've got some time
as well yeah that's right and we just
had a pretty big holiday
um so we have two questions when binance
i don't think i'm the person to jump in
there but
maybe if someone from the listings teams
want to jump in but
i don't think it's far behind really
we've got kukoin hobie yeah under the
belt and many more oh alex yeah
i can give my opinion i think uh i think
we're we're on track i don't think it
will be soon
but uh we're on track because typically
binance lists when you got a few tier
one exchanges we now have three we now
have coined hobby and gate io which are
from the top 10.
now i didn't check the trading volumes
today but yesterday it was 28 million
dollars
daily trading volume which which is
which is quite an amazing rise from our
typical two three four
million dollars per day so i think we're
just on track we should be patient
and um
it will come sooner than later but again
this is my personal point of view sir i
know obviously there are folks who are
focusing on that but uh it's it's a
process
yeah definitely
and the next question somebody this is
for ivan someone would like to know how
can they help you
how can they help with the project
oh well
i think
you can join our like community i can
send you a few links
like we have artists community and uh
there are a lot of artists who who are
like illustrating the warline and also
we have a team of technical volunteers
so we uh don't don't
spend any like any penny for for this
development but we have a donation
address and some people donate us so we
can like pay for infrastructure and
like
can can help you if you have some
emergency situation uh also we like have
a lot of
like pr stuff to do and marketing etc
etc and working with this tier one like
worldwide news so so if you want to jump
in and communication uh we also have a
community in discord which needs to be
somehow like engaged so that there are
there are there is a space so you so you
can just jump in like whenever you
feel you that
fits for your kind of uh
personality and and skills
so yeah please write me and we will like
network and then figure out how can you
help
okay great
perfect
okay yeah i think that's just about it
it if anybody else wants to jump in then
we'll close it and that's our weekly
call thank you for joining us and see
you next tuesday
bye everybody
bye julian hey everybody
