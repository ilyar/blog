deeper analytics so uh both stages so uh
 

221
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,870
deeper analytics so uh both stages so uh
they cannot be done one without another

they cannot be done one without another
 

223
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,110
they cannot be done one without another
and there is no sentence split in them

224

and there is no sentence split in them
 

225
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,550
and there is no sentence split in them
uh so and uh we will also

maybe some pieces of this solution
 

243
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,269
maybe some pieces of this solution
uh yeah so that's for proposals and also

244
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
uh yeah so that's for proposals and also
 

245
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,150
uh yeah so that's for proposals and also

uh
 

247
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,310
uh
we had a lot of discussion about

248
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
we had a lot of discussion about
 

249
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,870
we had a lot of discussion about
how to calculate jurors votes depend

250
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
how to calculate jurors votes depend
 

251
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,750
how to calculate jurors votes depend
because

252
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:23,760
because
 

253
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,350
because
they are not uh actually uh

254
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
they are not uh actually uh
 

255
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,829
they are not uh actually uh
put the votes uh

256
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
put the votes uh
 

257
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,550
put the votes uh
for all submissions time to time and

258
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
for all submissions time to time and
 

259
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,150

board of votes and others don't so how

262
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
board of votes and others don't so how
 

263
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,910
board of votes and others don't so how
would you

264
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
would you
 

265
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,949
would you
calculate every score that directly

266
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
calculate every score that directly
 

267
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,590
calculate every score that directly
affects the price place and for this

268
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
affects the price place and for this
 

269
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,790
affects the price place and for this
purpose uh i added to our procedural

270
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
purpose uh i added to our procedural
 

271
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,269
purpose uh i added to our procedural
remarks documents the uh possibility to

272
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
remarks documents the uh possibility to
 

273
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,430
remarks documents the uh possibility to
choose between three calculations

274
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
choose between three calculations
 

275
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,750
choose between three calculations
actually so the first one is a default

276
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
actually so the first one is a default
 

277
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,750
actually so the first one is a default
one uh

278
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
one uh
 

279
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,550
one uh
where all those count as eligible ones

280
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
where all those count as eligible ones
 

281
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,590
where all those count as eligible ones
and

282
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
and
 

283
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,150
and
it is used by default and if you don't

284
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
it is used by default and if you don't
 

285
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,670
it is used by default and if you don't
specify uh

286
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
specify uh
 

287
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,269
specify uh
anything else

288
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,279
anything else
 

289
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,829
anything else
uh and this just removes the ambiguity

290
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
uh and this just removes the ambiguity
 

291
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:14,790
uh and this just removes the ambiguity
that

292
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,800
that

the second node is the strict mode uh

296
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
the second node is the strict mode uh
 

297
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,990
the second node is the strict mode uh
when

298
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
when
 

299
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,630
when
you uh take the submission with the

300
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
you uh take the submission with the
 

301
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,550
you uh take the submission with the
least number of rules

302
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
least number of rules
 

303
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,829
least number of rules
uh you take this number and take the

304
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
uh you take this number and take the
 

305
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,150
uh you take this number and take the
same number of worst

306
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
same number of worst
 

307
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,269

scores in uh other submissions
 

309
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,670
scores in uh other submissions
and then you define the winner so uh it

310
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,680
and then you define the winner so uh it
 

311
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,110
and then you define the winner so uh it
means that if you

312
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
means that if you
 

313
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,069
means that if you
got uh some rejects so these rejects

314
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
got uh some rejects so these rejects
 

315
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,550
got uh some rejects so these rejects
will seriously affect

316
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
will seriously affect
 

317
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,590
will seriously affect
uh and uh on the contrary there is a

318
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
uh and uh on the contrary there is a
 

319
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,670
uh and uh on the contrary there is a
lose mode uh that uh takes uh

320
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:49,680
lose mode uh that uh takes uh
 

321
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,310
lose mode uh that uh takes uh
the same number of the best scores

322
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
the same number of the best scores
 

323
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,670
the same number of the best scores
published for your submission and uh

published for your submission and uh
 

325
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,350
published for your submission and uh
in this mode uh if you get a lot of good

326
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
in this mode uh if you get a lot of good
 

327
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,269
in this mode uh if you get a lot of good
uh

uh
 

329
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,750
uh
good scores from jurors so this probably

330
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
good scores from jurors so this probably
 

331
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,030
good scores from jurors so this probably
means that you will get the highest

332
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
means that you will get the highest
 

333
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,990
means that you will get the highest
score

334
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,000

all of it it uh
 

339
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,350
all of it it uh
really depends on the context creator so

00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,360
really depends on the context creator so
 

341
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,750
really depends on the context creator so
who will choose which modes or

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,269
those jurors who have already posted
their votes they should do this again

528
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
their votes they should do this again
 

529
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,470
their votes they should do this again
and uh

530
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
and uh
 

531
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,389
and uh
if they want to change something so

532
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:18,399
if they want to change something so
 

533
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,110
if they want to change something so
they're afraid to do so

534
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
they're afraid to do so
 

535
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,030
they're afraid to do so
in fact they have their advance because

536
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
in fact they have their advance because
 

537
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,150
in fact they have their advance because
uh some advanced

538
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
uh some advanced
 

539
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,069
uh some advanced
because they already have read the

540
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
because they already have read the
 

541
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,310
because they already have read the
documents and they already have some

542
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,320
documents and they already have some
 

543
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,310
documents and they already have some
knowledge but now they will have some

544
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320
knowledge but now they will have some
 

545
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,790
knowledge but now they will have some
additional time to analyze deeper and

546
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800
additional time to analyze deeper and
 

547
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,590
additional time to analyze deeper and
maybe even run a session with

548
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,600
maybe even run a session with
 

549
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,590
maybe even run a session with
participants but i personally would

550
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600
participants but i personally would
 

551
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,230
participants but i personally would
prefer to do

552
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
prefer to do
 

553
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,069
prefer to do
but this means that uh

554
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,079
but this means that uh
 

555
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,749
but this means that uh
voids uh now go out and

556
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:47,759
voids uh now go out and
 

557
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,509
voids uh now go out and
everybody needs to revolt and forward uh

558
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
everybody needs to revolt and forward uh

because how the voting extension works
actually so uh the interface group that

568
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
actually so uh the interface group that
 

569
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,430
actually so uh the interface group that
in fact deploys one additional contract

570
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:09,440
in fact deploys one additional contract
 

571
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,189
in fact deploys one additional contract
and transfers all the

572
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:11,199
and transfers all the
 

573
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,430
and transfers all the
data from the old ones to the new one uh

574
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
data from the old ones to the new one uh
 

575
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,470

except for the one parameter uh i don't

576
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
except for the one parameter uh i don't
 

577
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,069

know if they can transfer only

578
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:18,079
know if they can transfer only
 

579
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,350
know if they can transfer only
submissions and without your

580
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
submissions and without your
 

581
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,749

yeah votes

582
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:21,759
yeah votes
 

583
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,230
yeah votes
it's not so big work in this case

584
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
it's not so big work in this case
 

585
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,470
it's not so big work in this case
because there are only four submissions

586
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
because there are only four submissions
 

587
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,189
because there are only four submissions
for now it's not maybe so important even

588
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:29,199
for now it's not maybe so important even
 

589
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,069
for now it's not maybe so important even
for me for example i did every time

596
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
quote and after that working it needs to
 

597
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,310
quote and after that working it needs to
copy past one more time but uh for me

598
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,320
copy past one more time but uh for me
 

599
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,150
copy past one more time but uh for me

first first question of first suggestion
 

675
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,669
first first question of first suggestion
let's say probably we should speak with

676
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
let's say probably we should speak with
 

677
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,029
let's say probably we should speak with
the the the other governances and so on

the the the other governances and so on
 

679
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,630
the the the other governances and so on
that the second suggestion is to

680
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
that the second suggestion is to
 

681
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,789
that the second suggestion is to
trying to

682
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:26,799
trying to
 

683
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,310

by the groups probably

690
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:36,400
by the groups probably
 

691
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,350

it will be complicate uh the process and

00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
it will be complicate uh the process and
 

693
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,110
it will be complicate uh the process and
i'm not sure about it but to discuss

694

about that so now we have only the the
 

697
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,950
about that so now we have only the the
few few the small fields to to explain

698
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960
few few the small fields to to explain
 

699
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,590
few few the small fields to to explain
something but some some sometimes it's

700
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
something but some some sometimes it's
 

701
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,789
something but some some sometimes it's
not enough

702
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
not enough
 

703
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,070
not enough
and

704

five or six but nine of it
 

727
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,549
five or six but nine of it
and what does it mean that's the average

728
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:20,559
and what does it mean that's the average
 

729
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,950
and what does it mean that's the average
calculation it's completely different

730
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
calculation it's completely different
 

731
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,750
calculation it's completely different
yeah it should be somehow it should be

732
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:25,760
yeah it should be somehow it should be
 

733
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,789
yeah it should be somehow it should be
somehow harmonized and i don't know how

734
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:28,799
somehow harmonized and i don't know how
 

735
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,950
somehow harmonized and i don't know how
i think about it but i i strongly

736
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:30,960
i think about it but i i strongly
 

737
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,909
i think about it but i i strongly
believe that that that's the uh

738
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
believe that that that's the uh
 

739
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,750
believe that that that's the uh
in in some

740
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:35,760
in in some
 

741
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,190
in in some
such cases the average um

742
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
such cases the average um
 

743
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,950
such cases the average um
evaluation should be completely

744
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:40,960
evaluation should be completely
 

745
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,830
evaluation should be completely
different in frame and the one contest

746
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:43,840
different in frame and the one contest
 

747
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,510
different in frame and the one contest

to answer you so first uh you can use
easy votes so it already supports i do a

00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,280
easy votes so it already supports i do a
 

753
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,590
easy votes so it already supports i do a
lot larger comments so it's it's not

actually not possible now uh it's uh
there is a work done in parallel of the

776
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:18,960
there is a work done in parallel of the

783
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,510
uh however uh i don't know there's a
problem there and most probably if it

784
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
problem there and most probably if it
 

785
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,549
problem there and most probably if it
will come

786
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:30,559

remarks document so it contains already
the calculation

798
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:46,840

 

799
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,470

contest create you can select uh so
 

803
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,430
contest create you can select uh so
which mode and how the which scores will

804
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
which mode and how the which scores will
 

805
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,830
which mode and how the which scores will
be considered legitimate at the moment

806
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:57,840
be considered legitimate at the moment
 

807
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,510
be considered legitimate at the moment
of uh

808

so uh i think it covers almost 100
 

813
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,710
so uh i think it covers almost 100
percent of situations

814
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
percent of situations
 

815
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,549
percent of situations
good but uh will did

816
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:08,559
good but uh will did
 

817
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,549
good but uh will did

procedural remarks i personally know

836
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
procedural remarks i personally know
 

837
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,070
procedural remarks i personally know
it's it's been used at least in two or

838
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,080
it's it's been used at least in two or
 

839
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,230
it's it's been used at least in two or
three other sub governances uh and

840
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,240
three other sub governances uh and
 

841
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,590
three other sub governances uh and
hopefully they will also accept uh the

hopefully they will also accept uh the
 

843
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,990
hopefully they will also accept uh the
second version of it so

844
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,000
second version of it so
 

845
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,510
second version of it so
as a benchmark

you mean in the governance interface

894
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:53,520
you mean in the governance interface
 

895
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,510

899
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,390
owe it yeah i believe what i believe
that the governor's interface is the

900
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,400
that the governor's interface is the
 

901
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,029
that the governor's interface is the
some somehow mistaken calculator yes

902
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:03,039
some somehow mistaken calculator yes
 

903
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,990
some somehow mistaken calculator yes
don't pay attention to it because uh it

904
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,000
don't pay attention to it because uh it
 

905
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,750
don't pay attention to it because uh it
calculates uh the average score in

906
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:09,760
calculates uh the average score in
 

907
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,230
calculates uh the average score in
its own specific manner

908
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:12,240
its own specific manner
 

909
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,710
its own specific manner
and uh this is why a

910
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:14,720
and uh this is why a
 

911
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,510
and uh this is why a
long time ago i proposed to change the

912
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,520
long time ago i proposed to change the
 

913
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,350
long time ago i proposed to change the
consensus mechanism specifically for the

914
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
consensus mechanism specifically for the
 

915
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,830
consensus mechanism specifically for the
device of governance

916
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:20,840
device of governance
 

917
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,789
device of governance
because

918
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:22,799
because
 

919
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,789
because
in the governance interface and first of

920
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:24,799
in the governance interface and first of
 

921
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,070
in the governance interface and first of
all it considers

922
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,080
all it considers
 

923
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,549
all it considers
that uh

924
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:28,559
that uh
 

925
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,230
that uh
any proposal is

926
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:30,240
any proposal is
 

927
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,990
any proposal is
uh accepted

928
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,000
uh accepted
 

929
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,549
uh accepted
and unless it is specifically rejected

930
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:34,559
and unless it is specifically rejected
 

931
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,510
and unless it is specifically rejected
by jurors and this is not convenient and

932
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
by jurors and this is not convenient and
 

933
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,310
by jurors and this is not convenient and
it creates a lot of confusion

934
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,320
it creates a lot of confusion
 

935
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,870
it creates a lot of confusion
that's why long ago we changed this to

936
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:42,880
that's why long ago we changed this to
 

937
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,669
that's why long ago we changed this to
that every submission is considered

938
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:45,679
that every submission is considered
 

939
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,029
that every submission is considered
rejected if it's not

940
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:49,039
rejected if it's not
 

941
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,830
rejected if it's not
approved by the jurors so which is uh

942
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:51,840
approved by the jurors so which is uh
 

943
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,590
approved by the jurors so which is uh
more fair and more

944
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:53,600
more fair and more
 

945
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,310
more fair and more
easy to understand also uh

946
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320
easy to understand also uh
 

947
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,870
easy to understand also uh

because uh out there there is a
 

959
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,390

procedure on how can you calculate uh
 

961
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,789
procedure on how can you calculate uh
the average score of how to calculate

on what is the threshold score and a lot
lot of other information because uh this

is you know like uh
 

971
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,390
is you know like uh
safety measures uh are written by the

blood the same principle pretty much is
 

975
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,470
blood the same principle pretty much is
for our procedural remarks because we

976
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:30,480
for our procedural remarks because we
 

977
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,789
for our procedural remarks because we
made some mistakes in the very beginning

978
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:32,799
made some mistakes in the very beginning
 

979
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,029
made some mistakes in the very beginning
it's okay but we're learning our

mistakes and
 

983
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,269
mistakes and
we try to uh

984
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:39,279
we try to uh
 

985
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,350
we try to uh
reflect how we believe the contrast

986
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:43,360
reflect how we believe the contrast
 

987
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,990

system uh should work in this procedural

988
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,000

read it uh still so it's it's important
 

1001
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,590
read it uh still so it's it's important
to do this now because

1002
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:01,600
to do this now because
 

1003
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,590
to do this now because
uh there are a lot of useful information

1004
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:03,600
uh there are a lot of useful information
 

1005
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,630
uh there are a lot of useful information
inside it and it's it really makes the

1006
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:06,640
inside it and it's it really makes the
 

1007
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,750
inside it and it's it really makes the
voting

1008
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:07,760

1009
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,909
voting
and

1010
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:09,919
and
 

1011
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,510
and
participation in the contest really

1012
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
participation in the contest really
 

1013
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:18,470
participation in the contest really
clear and transparent

1015
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,789

so average points which are

1016
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:20,799
so average points which are
 

1017
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,350
so average points which are
shown in this interface they are on and

1018
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:23,360
shown in this interface they are on and
 

1019
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,909
shown in this interface they are on and
it recounts somehow

1020
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:25,919
it recounts somehow
 

1021
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,269
it recounts somehow
yes

they are
 

1051
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,269
they are
in fact tailored to be universal so

1052
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:07,279
in fact tailored to be universal so
 

1053
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,830
in fact tailored to be universal so
instead

this piece here
 

1071
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,750
this piece here
so uh

1072
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:31,760
so uh
 

1073
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,630
so uh
with

with
 

1075
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,549
with
the first place taking the

1076
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:34,559
the first place taking the
 

1077
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,789
the first place taking the
two places taking the rewards and these

1078
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:36,799
two places taking the rewards and these
 

1079
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,470
two places taking the rewards and these
ones for example they do not pass the

1080
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,480
ones for example they do not pass the
 

1081
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,669
ones for example they do not pass the
threshold actually because uh rejects

1082
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:41,679
threshold actually because uh rejects
 

1083
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,789
threshold actually because uh rejects
count as zero and they lower the score

1084
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:46,799

 

1085
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,710

1101
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,190

so for now it's made only

1102
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:09,200
so for now it's made only
 

1103
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,950
so for now it's made only
manually

1104
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:10,960
manually
 

1105
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,909
manually
unfortunately yes but hopefully

1106
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:13,919
unfortunately yes but hopefully
 

1107
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,990
unfortunately yes but hopefully
there are already some tools that

1108
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,000
there are already some tools that
 

1109
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,389
there are already some tools that
facilitate a lot of calculation for

1110
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:18,399
facilitate a lot of calculation for
 

1111
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,029
facilitate a lot of calculation for
example i personally use the one that

1112
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:21,039
example i personally use the one that
 

1113
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,669
example i personally use the one that
was developed by the

1114
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:23,679
was developed by the
 

1115
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,389
was developed by the
uh

1116
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:24,399
uh
 

1117
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,590
uh
by daniel uh so it is called uh free

1118
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:27,600
by daniel uh so it is called uh free
 

1119
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,590
by daniel uh so it is called uh free
throws

1120
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:29,600
throws
 

1121
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,669
throws
because that's the torque

1122
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:31,679
because that's the torque
 

1123
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:38,870
because that's the torque
so i will just

1124
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:38,880

 

1125
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,770

uh but still it's a universal one that

1126
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:41,780
uh but still it's a universal one that
 

1127
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,710
uh but still it's a universal one that

doesn't allow certain functionality and

1130
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:46,960
doesn't allow certain functionality and
 

1131
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,269
doesn't allow certain functionality and
you need to every time check it manually

1132
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:51,279

 

1133
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,230

hopefully

1134
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,240
hopefully
 

1135
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,909
hopefully
one day you will automate all of this

1136
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:53,919
one day you will automate all of this
 

1137
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,310
one day you will automate all of this
but not for now

uh probably it's the time to do

1204
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,120
uh probably it's the time to do
 

1205
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,430
uh probably it's the time to do
to do not do twice

1206
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:17,440
to do not do twice
 

1207
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,950
to do not do twice
that double work uh probably we will

1208
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:20,960
that double work uh probably we will
 

1209
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,070
that double work uh probably we will
have to say

1210
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,080
have to say
 

1211
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,950
have to say
we'll update it one time with the nimrod

1212
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:24,960
we'll update it one time with the nimrod
 

1213
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,950
we'll update it one time with the nimrod
exclusion there was zero exclusion after

1214
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:26,960
exclusion there was zero exclusion after
 

1215
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,750
exclusion there was zero exclusion after
the voting no no zura is not excluded

1216
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:29,760
the voting no no zura is not excluded

from the membership right

1218
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:31,760
from the membership right
 

1219
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,630
from the membership right
actually actually he's still a member of

1220
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:34,640
actually actually he's still a member of
 

1221
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,870
actually actually he's still a member of
the government he performs his duties

1222
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:36,880
the government he performs his duties
 

1223
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,510
the government he performs his duties
custodian as well got it sure for the

1224
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:39,520
custodian as well got it sure for the
 

1225
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,950
custodian as well got it sure for the
for the payment in the the government

1226
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:40,960
for the payment in the the government
 

1227
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,029
for the payment in the the government
absolutely absolutely yeah so he just

1228
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:43,039
absolutely absolutely yeah so he just
 

1229
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,750
absolutely absolutely yeah so he just
haven't have no time to to to judge him

1230
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:45,760
haven't have no time to to to judge him
 

1231
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,389
haven't have no time to to to judge him
sort of sorted out a lot of

1232
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:48,399
sort of sorted out a lot of
 

1233
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,430
sort of sorted out a lot of
papers yeah

1234
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:53,440

 

1235
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,070

it's a heavy work you know so uh to to

1236
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,080
it's a heavy work you know so uh to to
 

1237
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,470
it's a heavy work you know so uh to to
read out of all these papers and to

1238
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:58,480
read out of all these papers and to
 

1239
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,470
read out of all these papers and to
install them to try to understand how

1240
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:00,480
install them to try to understand how
 

1241
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,510
install them to try to understand how
they work so to ask questions so it's

1242
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,520
they work so to ask questions so it's
 

1243
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,510
they work so to ask questions so it's
really time consuming

1244
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:07,520

 

1245
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,470

okay

1246
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:08,480
okay
 

1247
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,350
okay
uh so let's move on so uh

1248
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,360
uh so let's move on so uh
 

1249
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,830
uh so let's move on so uh
let's discuss the results of the lending

1250
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:13,840
let's discuss the results of the lending
 

1251
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,870
let's discuss the results of the lending
contest uh which is uh

1252
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:16,880
contest uh which is uh
 

1253
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,669
contest uh which is uh
resulted in being quite interesting one

1254
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:19,679
resulted in being quite interesting one
 

1255
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,430
resulted in being quite interesting one
uh and

1256
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:21,440
uh and
 

1257
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,549
uh and
we

1258
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:22,559
we
 

1259
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,269
we
got some insights from it so

1260
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:25,279
got some insights from it so
 

1261
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,750
got some insights from it so
uh the major insight is that

1262
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:29,760

 

1263
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,590

it confirmed uh what what i suppose but

1264
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:33,600
it confirmed uh what what i suppose but
 

1265
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,190
it confirmed uh what what i suppose but
but still

1266
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:35,200
but still
 

1267
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,029
but still
most of the

1268
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:37,039
most of the

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,830
most of the

1373
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:46,950
which currently doesn't exist in crypto
yeah so

1374
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:46,960
yeah so
 

1375
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,549
yeah so
of course we can easily take this

1376
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:48,559
of course we can easily take this
 

1377
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,110
of course we can easily take this
analytics and just copy paste it from

1378
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,120
analytics and just copy paste it from
 

1379
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,909
analytics and just copy paste it from
other but without the deep understanding

1380
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:53,919
other but without the deep understanding
 

1381
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,590
other but without the deep understanding
on why

1382
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:55,600
on why
 

1383
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,669
on why
they selected uh

1384
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:57,679
they selected uh
 

1385
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,710
they selected uh
this or that ratio so uh

1386
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:00,720
this or that ratio so uh
 

1387
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,750
this or that ratio so uh
it is

1388
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:01,760
it is
 

1389
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,750
it is
not a good way to go

1390
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:03,760
not a good way to go
 

1391
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,909
not a good way to go
so uh

1392
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:05,919
so uh
 

1393
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,029
so uh
what i would do actually is first of all

1394
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:09,039
what i would do actually is first of all
 

1395
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,750
what i would do actually is first of all
i would run additional contests or to

1396
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:11,760
i would run additional contests or to
 

1397
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,149
i would run additional contests or to
for building the mass model

1398
00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:14,159
for building the mass model
 

1399
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,590
for building the mass model
for landing uh based on the other

1400
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:17,600
for landing uh based on the other
 

1401
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,990
for landing uh based on the other
and maybe grounding all the results and

1402
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,000
and maybe grounding all the results and
 

1403
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,750
and maybe grounding all the results and
how they can be reduced in future

1404
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:21,760
how they can be reduced in future
 

1405
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,950
how they can be reduced in future
actually so what i mean is that

1406
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:24,960
actually so what i mean is that
 

1407
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,549
actually so what i mean is that
uh in case

1408
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:26,559
uh in case
 

1409
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,070
uh in case
uh we would like uh or other operators

1410
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,080
uh we would like uh or other operators
 

1411
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,549
uh we would like uh or other operators
landing platform would like to add some

1412
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:32,559
landing platform would like to add some
 

1413
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,230
landing platform would like to add some
additional coins and

1414
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:34,240
additional coins and
 

1415
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,310
additional coins and
how he should score it

1416
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:36,320
how he should score it
 

1417
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,870
how he should score it
because uh of course in other

1418
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:38,880
because uh of course in other
 

1419
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,830
because uh of course in other
documentation now it is a state as a

1420
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:41,840
documentation now it is a state as a
 

1421
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,669
documentation now it is a state as a
result of

1422
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:43,679
result of
 

1423
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,830
result of
the mathematician boards

1424
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:45,840
the mathematician boards
 

1425
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,630
the mathematician boards
but if you need to approach

1426
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:48,640
but if you need to approach
 

1427
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,430
but if you need to approach
an absolutely new asset so what is what

1428
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:51,440
an absolutely new asset so what is what
 

1429
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,389
an absolutely new asset so what is what
would be the procedure and uh

1430
00:33:54,389 --> 00:33:54,399
would be the procedure and uh
 

1431
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,750
would be the procedure and uh
i would uh maybe run the contest that uh

1432
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:57,760
i would uh maybe run the contest that uh
 

1433
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,710
i would uh maybe run the contest that uh
will

1434
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:58,720
will
 

1435
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,230
will
help to explain uh all of this stuff and

1436
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:02,240
help to explain uh all of this stuff and
 

1437
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,470
help to explain uh all of this stuff and
also propose a model on how to add new

1438
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:04,480
also propose a model on how to add new
 

1439
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,029
also propose a model on how to add new
assets to this learning protocol

1440
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:07,039
assets to this learning protocol
 

1441
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,109
assets to this learning protocol
uh and also speaking of implementation

1442
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:09,119
uh and also speaking of implementation
 

1443
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,990
uh and also speaking of implementation
part um

1444
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,000
part um
 

1445
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,270
part um
we can already start approaching the

1446
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:15,280
we can already start approaching the
 

1447
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,349
we can already start approaching the
first implementation phase maybe the

1448
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:17,359
first implementation phase maybe the
 

1449
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,790
first implementation phase maybe the
simplest one

1450
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:18,800
simplest one
 

1451
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,750
simplest one
uh

1452
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:21,760
uh
 

1453
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,669
uh
i would personally of course target the

1454
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:23,679
i would personally of course target the
 

1455
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,669
i would personally of course target the
market leaders

1456
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:25,679
market leaders
 

1457
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,950
market leaders
and mostly uh copy the models of other

1458
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:28,960
and mostly uh copy the models of other
 

1459
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,030
and mostly uh copy the models of other
compounds and maker

1460
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,040
compounds and maker
 

1461
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,069
compounds and maker
they are not

1462
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:32,079
they are not
 

1463
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,909
they are not
so much different from each other and

1464
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:33,919
so much different from each other and
 

1465
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:35,109
so much different from each other and
they proved

1466
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:35,119
they proved
 

1467
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,869
they proved
by the time

1468
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:36,879
by the time
 

1469
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,389
by the time
that they uh very good ones uh but again

1470
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:40,399
that they uh very good ones uh but again
 

1471
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:41,909
that they uh very good ones uh but again
uh

1472
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:41,919
uh
 

1473
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:43,909
uh
i think that we will discover a lot a

1474
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:43,919
i think that we will discover a lot a
 

1475
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,030
i think that we will discover a lot a
lot of

1476
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,040
lot of
 

1477
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,190
lot of
peculiarities when trying to implement

1478
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,200
peculiarities when trying to implement
 

1479
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,030
peculiarities when trying to implement
this in freedom

1480
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,040
this in freedom

1497
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,150

really no ideas

1498
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:12,160
really no ideas
 

1499
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,069
really no ideas
or is it too complex subject to discuss

1500
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:14,079
or is it too complex subject to discuss
 

1501
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,430
or is it too complex subject to discuss
for now

1502
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:19,440

 

1503
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,190

okay okay

1504
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,200
okay okay
 

1505
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,670
okay okay
okay in this case i will draft some

1506
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:23,680
okay in this case i will draft some
 

1507
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,710
okay in this case i will draft some
contests for mass models for the lending

1508
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:26,720
contests for mass models for the lending
 

1509
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,829
contests for mass models for the lending
protocol and

1510
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:28,839
protocol and
 

1511
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,109
protocol and
also uh

1512
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:31,119
also uh
 

1513
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,910
also uh
try to approach the what's what would be

1514
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:33,920
try to approach the what's what would be
 

1515
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,430
try to approach the what's what would be
the first stage of this lensing

1516
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:35,440
the first stage of this lensing
 

1517
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,270
the first stage of this lensing
implementation because

1518
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:37,280
implementation because
 

1519
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,069
implementation because
uh definitely the lending protocol is

1520
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:40,079
uh definitely the lending protocol is
 

1521
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,030
uh definitely the lending protocol is
something really neat here because it's

1522
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,040
something really neat here because it's
 

1523
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,630
something really neat here because it's
it's really

1524
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:44,640
it's really
 

1525
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,030
it's really
a missing piece for some high-level uh

1526
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,040
a missing piece for some high-level uh
 

1527
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,950
a missing piece for some high-level uh
protocols

1528
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:48,960
protocols
 

1529
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,349
protocols
that may come here

1530
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:51,359
that may come here
 

1531
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,310
that may come here
uh later and that we will be promoting

1532
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:54,320
uh later and that we will be promoting
 

1533
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,510
uh later and that we will be promoting
from the fireline sites to

okay
i also wanted to

1542
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:05,440
i also wanted to
 

1543
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,030
i also wanted to
announce and you may have heard already

1544
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,040

of the first stages that they will
 

1637
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,109
of the first stages that they will
simply recently add the support of the

1638
00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:01,119
simply recently add the support of the
 

1639
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,150
simply recently add the support of the
coins to the bridge so they could easily

1640
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:04,160
coins to the bridge so they could easily
 

1641
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,470
coins to the bridge so they could easily
transfer the native

1642
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:06,480
transfer the native
 

1643
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,990

tokens through the bridge to the
 

1645
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,790
tokens through the bridge to the
frequency system and at the second stage

1646
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:10,800
frequency system and at the second stage
 

1647
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,270
frequency system and at the second stage
so uh we will

1648

we have a lot of uh people who
understand good finance there's a lot of

1888
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:38,960
understand good finance there's a lot of
 

1889
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,270
understand good finance there's a lot of
people who understand well how friton

1890
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,280
people who understand well how friton
 

1891
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,390
people who understand well how friton
works

1892
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:42,400
works
 

1893
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,710
works
and all of them have their own opinion

1894
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:44,720
and all of them have their own opinion
 

1895
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,750
and all of them have their own opinion
and it's absolutely

1896
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:47,760
and it's absolutely
 

1897
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,190
and it's absolutely
good for for all of us if we have

1898
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:51,200
good for for all of us if we have
 

1899
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,790
good for for all of us if we have
both opinions

1900
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:52,800
both opinions
 

1901
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,109
both opinions
here because otherwise it will be just

1902
00:43:55,109 --> 00:43:55,119
here because otherwise it will be just
 

1903
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,750
here because otherwise it will be just
uh you know um

1904
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:57,760
uh you know um
 

1905
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,790

and so

1910
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:04,720
and so
 

1911
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,550
and so

1928
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:23,680
stages that
 

1929
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,710
stages that
on the second stage they will

1930
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:26,720
on the second stage they will
 

1931
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,069
on the second stage they will
make the native implementation

1932
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:30,079
make the native implementation
 

1933
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,870
make the native implementation
what did you mean by native because in

1934
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:32,880
what did you mean by native because in
 

1935
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,750
what did you mean by native because in

so right now the infrastructure is uh

1948
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:46,079
so right now the infrastructure is uh
 

1949
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,589
so right now the infrastructure is uh
tailored specifically to the ethereum

1950
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:47,599
tailored specifically to the ethereum
 

1951
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:48,790

smart contracts uh etc etc all of this
 

1959
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,950
smart contracts uh etc etc all of this
is packed to ethereum

1960
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:00,960

 

1961
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,030

when i say that at the second stage they

1962
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,040
when i say that at the second stage they
 

1963
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,950
when i say that at the second stage they
will uh

1964
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:04,960
will uh
 

1965
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,870
will uh
create the native the native stable

1966
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:06,880
create the native the native stable
 

1967
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,109
create the native the native stable
coins to free tone it's pretty much what

1968
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:09,119
coins to free tone it's pretty much what
 

1969
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,150

like uh what tesla does so uh initially

1970
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:12,160
like uh what tesla does so uh initially
 

1971
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,150
like uh what tesla does so uh initially
if you remember they were on the omni

1972
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:14,160
if you remember they were on the omni
 

1973
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,550
if you remember they were on the omni
protocol then they uh added the erc20

1974
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:18,560
protocol then they uh added the erc20
 

1975
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,150
protocol then they uh added the erc20
version of uh usdt then they added

1976
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,160
version of uh usdt then they added
 

1977
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,349
version of uh usdt then they added
patron and so on so forth so this is

1978
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:25,359
patron and so on so forth so this is
 

1979
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,750
patron and so on so forth so this is
pretty pretty similar case so they have

1980
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:27,760
pretty pretty similar case so they have
 

1981
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,790
pretty pretty similar case so they have
the

1982
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:30,800

 

1983
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,510

1984
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:33,520
single custody for the reserves
 

1985
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,630
single custody for the reserves
that uh stay behind the stable coin

1986
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:36,640
that uh stay behind the stable coin
 

1987
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,870
that uh stay behind the stable coin
but this liquidity uh

1988
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:38,880
but this liquidity uh
 

1989
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,550
but this liquidity uh
will be splitted actually uh between two

1990
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:42,560
will be splitted actually uh between two
 

1991
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,270
will be splitted actually uh between two
networks already so between ethereum and

1992
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:45,280
networks already so between ethereum and
 

1993
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,910

free tone whereas uh

1994
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:47,920
free tone whereas uh
 

1995
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,710
free tone whereas uh
at the first stage what actually happens

1996
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:50,720
at the first stage what actually happens
 

1997
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,790
at the first stage what actually happens
is that they uh

1998
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:52,800
is that they uh
 

1999
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,470
is that they uh
whole liquidity

2000
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:54,480

2006
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:00,480
stay in ethereum
 

2007
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,390
stay in ethereum
even the k is the case that they

2008
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:02,400
even the k is the case that they
 

2009
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,790
even the k is the case that they
transfer the coins through uh through

the second season will create the level

2032
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:30,800
the second season will create the level

one talking uh

2034
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:32,400
one talking uh
 

2035
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,950
one talking uh
directly on crypto

2036
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:34,960
directly on crypto
 

2037
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,109
directly on crypto
okay so they will

2038
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:37,119
okay so they will
 

2039
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,470
okay so they will
make some

2040
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:38,480
make some
 

2041
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,430
make some
mechanisms to directly stabilize uh

2042
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:41,440
mechanisms to directly stabilize uh
 

2043
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,790
mechanisms to directly stabilize uh
using some

2044
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:42,800
using some
 

2045
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,390
using some
uh in intra free-to-own mechanisms yeah

2046
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:46,400
uh in intra free-to-own mechanisms yeah
 

2047
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,069
uh in intra free-to-own mechanisms yeah
yeah that's why

2048
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:48,079
yeah that's why
 

2049
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,230
yeah that's why
okay but i don't think that

2050
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:50,240
okay but i don't think that
 

2051
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,230
okay but i don't think that
it is a good stage for the fire alliance

because there were
 

2055
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,670
because there were
will be no

2056
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:55,680
will be no
 

2057
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:01,190
will be no
no locks so no no locked uh tokens

2058
