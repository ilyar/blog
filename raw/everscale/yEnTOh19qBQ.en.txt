and we're going to hear about the new
surf app for desktop so i hope everybody
enjoys it but before we begin i'm going
to do my usual boring repetitive uh list
of call etiquettes so if you're not
i don't know if you're not running from
a tornado
uh
diving for scallops can you please turn
your cameras on give us a bright smile
uh please save your questions until each
presenter is finished with their
presentation
please use the raise hand feature and
zoom to ask a question and if you're
joining us on youtube
uh there's a comment section you can
leave a question we'll get to it at the
very end of the call and just as a
friendly reminder this call is
english only so
let's begin uh let's start with
technical updates like we usually do
media if you're ready go for it
hi
well
so uh as you know we have updated
created the network uh
with a new
cumulative update
which is uh which is a lot of uh a lot
of
stuff uh a lot of changes a lot of fixes
and
you know sort of things um we're waiting
for the
network to
kind of upgrade itself to the to the
like acceptable numbers like over 95 or
something
and as usual it goes quite well it's um
goes very fast uh until like 90 percent
or something and then
there is this 10 percent of people who
just don't give a
i don't know it's uh all sorts of
strange numbers strange versions that
they're running with their notes like
node version 14 by wearing 22 and so on
so 53
so on and so forth
so you always have this 10 lazy percent
that's why we have a
soft majority voting mechanism where we
should have having that mechanism but we
don't but anyway
so um
so we will wait
in the meantime
um we're checking on the like on the
devnet
um
the next
kind of switch
of the configuration parameters which
will enable
all these
wonderful features that are in this
upgrade so um
it's kind of a two-step process
including compression but also many
other things
and we're also working on copyleft
instruction as well
um
so it's in testing now
and the copyleft instruction requires
certain upgrades to the
to the configuration parameters of the
network which
which need to be done
in a certain particular way
that's
like it's complicated tiny things that
should just work
uh like 100
because if they don't
they have problems with networks so
that's why this is like
this does take time because it takes
time to verify and check them a lot
um so that's really
that's really
the thing once we upgrade it
of course i will you know we'll write a
list of things
in particular that that has been
upgraded
yeah there's a lot of versioning
mechanisms and dna versioning mechanisms
and a lot of versioning mechanisms but
we need to get through this mess
once it's for all
um
another thing that we are busy doing now
is we have finished the delector smart
contracts
and now we are
working on supporting the smart
contracts on the node
and we hope to
roll out this actually quite soon during
april we will move to
in the devnet we will move to the new
uh
completely new
uh election
kind of procedure in the network
um
and uh
yeah so that's um i think that's that's
all from me if you have any question
please be sure
do we does anyone have a question we
don't see hands raised but please
if not
okay
thank you very much mithia
let's go to our next presenter
we have alina
who's the chief operating officer of
swoy.dev
um she's here to talk about everland
ever lend as in lending not ever land um
sorry it's
have trouble pronouncing it sometimes
everland uh you
might recall she mentioned it on last
week's call um there were
several announcements in the chats and
now we're gonna
hear all the details and in case anybody
has technical questions she's also
brought her colleagues uh her cto and
and also an advisor so yeah alina
welcome if you're ready
tell us all about overland
yeah
uh hi ron and hello everybody i'd like
to show you a little presentation about
our of our project and i will share my
screen now
[Music]
hope you can see it yep
uh
well
here
i will start from showing you our
product
you can go to the website and
check it out
uh here we have the
lending platform
i recorded the
screen for you so we can save time for
presentation because
um
it takes time to
load some
operations so to make it more quickly
i'll show you the video but you can go
to the website and check
everything by yourself that everything
works exactly like in the presentation
uh well about our product um
we have lending platform where you can
borrow and land
assets
first of all you go to the platform you
connect your wallet for now ever wallet
or ever scale wallets are
available you can
sorry
yeah
as you can see on the video you can
choose to connect to wallets for the
example i chose our wallet the wallet
created by our team you can go to the
website of our wallet
rescale wallet and install it
it's
google chrome extension
if you use google chrome
uh
so yeah this is how you download it
for the website and then you go to back
to the platform connect your everscale
wallet and
create an account
to do this you have to have 10 errors on
your account
uh at least
to create an account cost less but
some parts of payment
will be
back on your account
after
creating
so here we have transaction
describe it
accept it sign it password
and yeah
here we have created account
since that moment you will see uh all
the information about your account here
all about all information about total
values like total supply and total
borrow here
they are relevant this is the fresh
video and here you have the
table with all the needed information
like uh
supply b bureau b supply balance
available for you and your debt this
table is about your account
so let's try to borrow some usd team
to do so
you have to
you have to supply uh some assets first
for example uh whoever it's
wrapped ever
to get them you can go to the platform
every scale token wrapper
connect wallet
and wrap some errors for now uh this
platform supports ever wallet only
this is why we updated our wallet
so
you can go to
uh to extensions
and drew and turn off ever wallet
after that moment
when you press
connect ever wallet
your everscale wallet will be connected
this is how our simulation works
it can be turned off in the account
settings enable overwatch emulation
but to wrap your tokens you need this
function
so after you wrap some tokens you go
back to the platform
and you supply some assets
press supply
we have a waiver here
and we press
supply after wrapping our errors
supply here you can see available
balance of your wallet for a supply
we press supply we confirm the
transaction oh sorry
and
then supply request sent okay
if you have any troubles feel free to
reload page
because sometimes it needs some time to
to upload all the information
after it's uploaded you can see
that available balance
is changed now we can borrow some assets
here you can see available
available amount for you
here we have 1.5 usd team because
not
to
all the amount you supplied you can
borrow
assets just for parts to keep it safe
well so here we borrow some usdt confirm
it
okay okay okay
and after that
when all information will be
uploaded you can see
brand press springfresh table
so now we can see
that uh your debt is one usdt which you
can repay any moment
and you can see your weather balance
here is your account rank your
collateral oh sorry
i need some
to upload borrow
amounts
sorry guys
okay so uh sorry
yeah yeah here will be your borrowed
amount one usd team your your supply
here your collateral
uh also we have
risk
information about your account
because since you borrowed some
assets you have two
ways of moving forward you pay back your
debt
and percentage any moment you want
uh
and we don't have time limit since your
collateral is enough uh to pay your debt
and to pay your
uh
percents you can
feel free to use received assets
uh here you can see risk meaning that
you borrowed quite
a lot
according to your collateral
and if your risk gets up to 100 percent
your loan become available to
liquidators
we have this function and any users can
become liquidator if they see risky
risky debt
uh which which was uh
100 risk
they go to your
to this
page and they pay your debt
uh they get collateral according to this
debt
and they get eight percent about that so
they can earn some on that
uh well that's pretty it uh so feel free
to use our platform his working platform
uh we launched on 18th of march
and uh we're happy to share with you
information that
we also launched token sale at the same
time as we launched our platform
and if you press to token page
you get
right
here
and here is all information you need
about our token
uh this is the token of existing working
platform
for now we have limitations
uh not more than
as i can remember for now 200 usd you
can borrow
because
we still test it on community and to
keep platforms safe for everybody we
decided to keep limits
uh also what is important to note that
right now our platform goes through
formal verification by the community we
just passed through the first stage and
uh
moving to the next one we launched the
platform before the end of formal
verification but as i said
uh we
uh we have limits for uh
essence amounts
uh so here on the page of everland
land token you can see all the needed
information about how the platform works
about the distribution of land tokens
here is our start sale 5.5 percent of
token total token supply
lock-up periods and best things and what
gives you token ownership
also you can see our telegram channel
twitter and medium we publish all the
relevant information
there about the project and if you want
to buy some lan tokens you just press
here and you will be sent to the ever
start page platform
our product project was the first one
project zero as we say uh on this
platform
we
very close to
uh to
our soft cup amount
this is launchpad system
so
if we
get to
softcup you depos you you're not buying
latin blend tokens like direct amount
you invest some efforts
into our project and when the
final
date comes
uh it's it will be in three days on the
31st and the 31st of march
you will get uh tokens in the mount
according to your part in the whole pool
uh yeah so i think that
oh it is very important to say that the
purpose the idea of our token is that
the community decides um
the future and
kind of the present of the platform
because
it will be those systems so many
questions will be
brought to the community and talking
holders will decide for example what
indicators will be said uh on the
platform of what limitations we have
what next stages we will have and
everything else what is also important
to note that um
our
token have some um
features like um features we plan to uh
make feature for liquidators
token holders will have priority in
liquidation process so they have they
will have
more chances to earn on the platform and
also it is important to note that um
to
to list a new asset on the platform if
you want to do that you have to pay
the
fee and this fee will be
in land tokens and this fee will be
burned so this is how we plan to reduce
total amount of tokens
it is also very important to know that
we plan to have uh
different
uh
farming programs
and other activities for the community
i'm sorry if it was too long so many
things to say
uh
please feel free to ask any questions we
are open to them here or in our social
media if you're not ready yet
thank you very much alina excellent
presentation we do have a question meter
yeah it doesn't work on brave
browser i cannot connect my wallet
so i couldn't try it then
brave brave browser
yep
yeah
like it does nothing and i'm clicking on
ever wallet to connect and just just not
responding at all
yeah braves like kind of a secure
browser it's more secure than you know
chrome or anything like that it's
often used okay
uh here we have andrei with us he is our
cto jd we have something to say about it
now or we should check it a bit later
because i'm not sure if we tried in this
browser
we'll check it later
okay okay okay okay thank you yeah i
cannot i cannot yeah i cannot check
because this is the only browser i use
to kind of put this with the crypto
stuff and
it's chrome based so it should work but
it's it has a little bit more
restrictions
but i'm using that for you know roxas
products
and that works so i know that wallets
like the but it's called ever wallet
works
okay thank you very much we didn't face
this before but we will check uh for
sure and improve what we can hear
and and i had a question i uh you said
what was the limit in usdt
the power 100 for now
for now
200. yes
because we tested
200.
200 to 100 of course it's 200 for now
we test it a lot but still it can be
different on
a lot of people and we decided to to
keep this limit until we
have the end of formal verification as i
said and
until this kind of testing period will
be over
understood understand thank you very
much
any other questions
if not okay thank you again for your
presentation wonderful interesting stuff
um
our next presenter i think just uh i'm
sorry i'm sorry ron i'm so sorry ron uh
to interrupt you yeah thank you very
much for the time uh i see that we don't
have questions by now but as i said
we're online on our social uh networks
and uh we had a session in english last

we had people who asked to tell more
about the project in russia in russian
so we plan to do on a session in russian
as well
with our technical director of course

keep updated and we will we will have a
session in russia for sure thank you
very much sorry
no no worries um and just for english
speakers i'm a basically ama and ask me
anything
um all right elena thank you yes sorry
just just one just
this one thing you you have a cross site
trackers on your website also which we
usually
trying not to do these things
uh as a as a community
kind of
deadline i don't know
no
usually we try to avoid this
is you can have an analytics
based on the blockchain activity of your
users you don't really need
those trackers and i don't use
uh
like web3 websites which has anything
which which provides any information
back to the server
and all these trackers are blocked
anyway but but i don't think you should
have them in the first place
yes sorry but we don't use the intercost
you do
no
yes you do
[Music]
check it can we get can we get like uh
we will check it again right or we
should get any which information

it's not loading anything
yeah i know but still
okay
okay for thank you for requirements
um
thank you everybody for your attention
thank you
okay
let's move on uh our next presenter well
i don't think needs any introduction at
all it's joanne from mrx my colleague
uh let's talk about the surf desktop app
which obviously
i can't resist and
be shameless and say i'm
100 behind it i support it because
frankly hey you know we're uh we're all
in it together so
yeah joanne
hi thank you thank you for that
introduction um i want to share my
screen
uh
i only have one monitor here so i gotta
pick wisely
um okay can you see
okie dokie great
great
so uh ladies and germs i've got a quick
presentation for you today and i know
rowley has been waiting since 2020 so
let's get on with it um
i'm thrilled to present to you
the new
well the first version of the surf
desktop app which is fantastic
if you don't know surf is the most
trusted episcopal browser for defy and
nft
remember that
um
so you can see that it has all the
features and functionality that you love
about surf mobile and the web version
it's got a clean and slick interface you
know the easy123 setup and per usual
uh
the surf team sends you a small amount
to
deduct
initiation fee
which will deploy your wallet your your
smart contract
so there's no setup fee no costs this is
a free
wonderful browser
and for those of you who enjoyed the
comfort of the web version you'll
appreciate that the desktop version
even more because it offers a bigger
viewport and of course it's more secure
in order to get here you'll have to go
to
the website but right now the link is
not
not on the main page of surf so you have
to go to eversurf forward slash
download and then you'll find your way
here
uh
so you can go down and pick your
operating system
your processor and download it and
enjoy
very simple
um unfortunately we have to say goodbye
to the web version of surf soon you know
it no longer meets the need the the
views of unfortunately it's great
yeah yeah but i
it i i used it a lot so
you know i'm sure others used it too
but it's not uh fast enough it's not
secure enough so we're going to replace
it
um with at the desktop client
uh what else so
shortly the surf team will be pushing
out a guide on how to install the
desktop version of surf
uh just to ensure that everybody
regardless of operating system can have
a smooth experience
um
and i'd like to highlight here
beta testing opportunity for beta
testing
if you want to be a beta tester which is
highly appreciated you can just scroll
down to
one experiment
go here
jump into join the community drives to
telegram chat or you can just use qr
codes to go whichever way you want to go
and
your feedback is very valuable
you can help make surf a really awesome
product which is going to stick around
for
ever
and uh
more communications will come after this
short presentation all in in surf
channels and on everscale channels
following this announcement and
if you have any more
if you have technical questions
uh
about the details then you should jump
into the surf chat on telegram
um
before i close it i'd also want to kind
of
plug
that the um
strategic round of the
cell
is ending soon so if you want to jump in
with uh
if you've got like over 100k evers you
could jump in for the token price at 20
cents
um or you can take advantage of
no threshold just you know buying
buying in at whenever um but the price
is a bit higher at 30 cents
and this stage is going to end on the
30th
um
and that's about it
just a short fi fyi and everything
happening
should we also mention that uh maybe
there are uh certain terms that could be
discussed for institutional investors
for the sale
mm-hmm
um from what i understand uh you know
institutional investors who might want
to bring in um
larger amounts
maybe dm me directly and we can talk
about that and figure something out for
you
absolutely
joanne
petition
any questions
i don't see any hands raised
no pretty simple
pretty simple cool download it try it
yeah download it try it uh ever.surf
forward slash download but of course um
yeah i know
you guys try to get the website up and
running before the call today but you
know it's kind of last minute so it'll
be it'll be working and yeah it'll
it'll be on it soon
all right yep
let's move on um let's go to kate
uh from pie union uh who's here to talk
to us about easy pay um spelled
differently i forgot if it's like one's
i i z i pay i believe
i'm sorry if i'm
but uh they've been making a lot of
really good noise in the community chats
uh i think a lot of people saw the
announcements and now we're gonna hear
about it firsthand so kate if you're
ready i'm gonna pass a microphone to you
please tell us about easy pay
yeah hi everyone and thanks ron for
introduction
so
let's start um i will share the screen
so you can see who we are and we will
jump to uh easy pay
products also
so um i'm from pi union we have a lot of
um
crypto products um to talk about
but now i'm going to focus on
easy pay
so this is um ever scale friendly
mastercard
uh which if you are interested after my
uh presentation you can either
leave
a message here on our website or just
go directly
to our website and if you have a
smartphone you can use apple store
google play to download our free
app
and get the easy pay card straight away
so
let's see if
you can see my presentation can you see
it now
yes we can yeah okay so just um again
this is how it works uh you download
quite a simple to use mobile app
you go through the kyc
verification
and once once onboarding is done um you
will receive
a mastercard
by post um
to your home address
so let's see uh the benefits
easy pay card can bring to your
community
so
it's a basic it's a classic mastercard
with a direct link to a crypto wallet
you will
get your european i ban without visiting
the bank
straight
in the
mobile app after the verification has
been done
uh you will see it just here on top of
the screen that will be your
most likely irish iban
and then
once um you receive the card you will be
able to use it
uh pretty much everywhere for online
payments hotel bookings atm withdrawals
and yeah you will enjoy the three
separate payments and low fees for atm
withdrawals and foreign exchange is
quite low as well if you compare it to
other banks card
so as i said it's a simple and quick
ekyc on boarding with four clicks we are
using a sums up kyc provider
which
where you will have to download your
proof of address proof of id and make a
selfie uh to do the onboarding we don't
do any credit checks uh on you so it's
just simply to verify that
you are who you are you are on the
passport or
your id card and that you have an
address in europe plus united kingdom
and then you can receive
um your card
if we take a look at the mobile app
as i said it's quite a simple and easy
to use
we
use a safe 3d secure for online payments
and you will also receive
a notifications to stay on track with
your spendings
and we also provide a customer support
24 7.
so this is our
uh easy pay cards uh and easy pay
application
i also have to mention that we have um
an
xpi uh crypto exchange platform which
looks like this uh
here it's um here you can
um
buy and sell um every and other
cryptocurrency you can see here
it it has a market order and limit
orders so you can also top up um
your wallet via
visa and mastercard and through the wire
transfer
you can buy sell of ever and convert
crypt to fiat and fiat to crypto
via our up
which is developed on tip3m
blockchain
and um
this is as you can see this is only the
web version we don't have a mobile
version yet
so what we are working on now
trying to optimize uh the use of the web
uh exchange platform and
easy pay card we are working on uh
introducing a new easy pay version 2
application it will look like this it's
already in the
testing stage
so
it will have the possibility to order
your easy pay card here and it also have
all your crypto wallets um on this side
so
by doing this we will combine and solve
the problem of
uh logging in into two different
platforms um
and
you don't need to do it
second registration so it will be
everything in one place
so you as i can say you order your card
you buy sell crypt and you use our
bridge crypto to fiat withdrawal up euro
to
any iban
so that's um quite
i hope i will be an easy uh product to
use um compare maybe to our web version
which is more
focused on professionals this will be
quite a simple um
an easy
application for people who likes quick
payments and don't want to miss the
opportunity to pay with crypto
um
so that's
about
the easy pay and just to summarize i
wanted to let you know
on our deadlines and roadmap so as i
mentioned we already have the web
version of xpi trade where you can buy
and sell
crypto and ever
and just i would say in two months we
are already on final testing stages uh
we will present you an upgraded uh easy
pay version of
the mobile app where you will be able to
buy and sell and use ever just
like a fiat
i would say give us two months and it
will be ready while you
upload the existing version and wait um
for your easy pay cards we will get this
um upgrade to you
and we also have
an online banking cryptocurrency support
and in quarter three we are working on
um getting a virtual cars um
ready as well
and the final thing uh we are working on
the mobile app and atm integration which
will offer you the possibility to sell
and buy
ever or any crypto in cash
so that's um
yeah and uh probably yeah the most
important part is how much does it cost
to get the easy pay card
it is uh 10 euros
and the service fee is only 99 cents per
month
the rest is absolutely for free we don't
have any hidden extra costs as i
mentioned we offer free separate
payments you can receive money for free
pay and use your cards any way you want
shops restaurants booking hotels
um
yeah
um ordering statements pin reissues so
that's that all is free of charge
um
if
you are interested so just
uh can download the easy pay application
have your id
or passport or driving license um to
hand together with the proof of address
in european union plus a united kingdom
and we do accept a different kind of
proof of address it's not just utility
bill or bank statements it could be also
a mobile phone bill it could be a letter
from the government
car insurance health insurance policy
so that's uh
quite a long list and as i said you also
have to make selfie
and
once the registration is done
uh in 10 working days you will receive
the card by post
so that's um
[Music]
probably it and if
you have any questions
i will
glad yet to
i try to
order your card
because i'm i'm european citizen
but uh the kyc process and i passed i
have cards like from crypto.com i can't
even show you if you want
that i have it so i i could pass
verification there
but uh
i did i couldn't pass your kyc it's um
because i leave my kind of uh
you know residency is in one country and
i live currently in like i have an
address where card should arrive in nara
in another country
and um
yeah you know it's just stuck so i
cannot use your card
uh
if if you have if you provide the
passport so yeah you cannot provide an
id of one country and a proof of address
in another country that doesn't work but
if you provide a passport and then proof
of
address
which is written on their
id or if it's a bank statement or
something i i did i did provide i did
provide i did provide the residence
permit where they're written on that
it's on residence permit which is the
address is written upon but you're not
accepting that
i know was what was the reason
no reason just proof of address they
want proof of address and
uh
another question which you
uh
[Music]
that's another issue which you
said right now is that you cannot give a
eu passport or id and address in any
other eu country but
sorry but it's a bit strange
it sounds like straight because there
are a lot of people who leaves you know
no no no no it's
you know we can accept any passport it
could be a russian passport
no problem ukrainian passport but you
have to live in european union yeah but
you but you're not you're not accepted
you're just you know i'm giving you the
resident permits in one country european
country
i have a residency in two european
countries i give both of them and but
the address where i'm currently right
now located is in another european
country but you're not accepting and i
have a proof of address here but you're
not accepting them
now that that's strange if uh you know
can i yeah i can is it media
yes
i can i can check it for you i will ask
our kyc guys what is that
[Laughter]
but you know in general i mean in
general if everyone that cannot pass kyc
should run to you i mean i don't think
it's a very scary
it's just like um we use as some
substance yeah kyc provider they do um a
lot of like
i would say 50
of checks are done automatically and
then just a final
click on the button is done by the kyc
officer
because you know the system can make a
mistake and
we've seen such a thing so you have to
be sure that the person is you know
provided all correct documents
but behind we have a kyc officer who
does uh check everything manually and if
there is an issue and the system doesn't
accept it they
send you an email requesting alternative
documents they did but i don't have
alternative documents in that respect so
what do i need so they what do i give
them
that's the situation right the situation
as i said if it's
the matter of id please provide a
passport
my passport is israel is really possible
it's okay yeah it uh passport could be
from any country it doesn't matter yeah
but what is the the issue is not for the
passport with my id the issues with the
address
because the address is from different
country right
yeah
it should be the address should be in
european union so it isn't european
union it is but in different country and
then the idea is issued
then you have to provide your israelian
passport
but again kate sorry
very strange okay
did i get you because yeah yeah if um
you cannot provide uh an id from one
country um
and then uh proof
yeah yeah i can yeah
so here we go we cannot tell this
please finalize a sentence you cannot
provide any passport from let's say
let's say israel and the residential
ship in in any other european country
no you can you cannot
you can't you can but you cannot provide
an european id from one country
and
proof of address
on another european idea from another
country
isn't that
a little bit strange you know
in european union we can travel and live
in different countries that's the full
point
i have two i have two resident permits
and two different european countries so
i could receive these permits in two
different european but i cannot receive
a card
[Laughter]
yes the the matter of having you know if
you you cannot provide two different id
cards
you also have to have your passport so
that's
i think you're not asking for well
you're not asking for a passport but
well anyway i think it's strange
but still
to have a and
for instance i have all the german
passport as well but i now registered in
portugal because we
relocate our company to portugal from
russia so is it possible to show you or
to give to provide you with my german
passport and leave portuguese
residential ship which i have
yes and on this residential uh
cart do you have an address where you
live
sure it's not a card it's not the
certificate of registration in in
portugal yeah that that's perfect
doesn't matter
that yeah that's perfect
it works
and then another question i wrote into
our chat is what about the automatic
exchange of information as you know all
the banks in europe
are
exchanging
information about
clients where bank accounts in different
countries what about
your irish underwriter
uh we have here we have a license we
have an
we are an agent to electronic money
institution which is an irish bank yeah
it's um pfs
yeah and they are regulated uh and
certified by central bank of ireland
so that is why they provide an irish
iban
okay
and what which bank is it by the way in
ireland
it's called pfs
pfs
so and what
is this pf
s bank
a participant of this automated exchange
information system
with a central bank of ireland
yeah i think it's it's a part of eu
eugenia i think they are
they're obliged
yes i understand but you don't have a
direct account with uh bfc
bfs basically i think you do because
they provide you with the ibon as i hear
right you're providing the i ban so
yeah it's normal bank account i think
got you thank you okay so
it's actually it's very um
thing line how you call it
it's a
bank account is one thing especially for
tax purposes so it's also some uh
good hints for you let's say if
for the tax reasons at the end of the
year you have to provide all your bank
accounts
when you have easy pay
you have i ban
which
officially is not a bank account and you
don't need and you don't need to report
money on your easy pay account
okay so
no
that's i know for sure so
you you cannot uh hold with there are
limits you cannot have like 150
uh on your easy pay account
for tax evasion yeah but
uh we have uh limits you can check on on
the website um
which you can hold on the cart
but that's that's the point it's not a
bank account it is um
you can call it an account
you have um i ban
but the difference for the tax man
uh yeah you you don't need to
uh report uh money on your easy pay
is it really uh
sure is it certain i think you do i
think it's not that you don't need to i
think that the point is i mean you do
need to
you know you do need to give information
a little bit
the point is that they don't get they
don't give information on this account
because the limits right
which is also our question about media
because i
you know again personally i wouldn't
evade taxes on the european cards anyway
that's a bad thing the problem is if you
have a residential ship in other country
you have to be reported in those in the
country where you're
indeed leave
rather than
where you have your passport issued
yeah but you will have proof of address
that's why they ask for proof of address
i think
just to simplify things guys uh i mean
um unless i'm mistaking the phrase
you're looking for cases a neo bank um
so it's very similar to revolut it
sounds it's
not a fully functioning bank account but
it has basically all the working
features of
uh yeah i probably wouldn't encourage
tax evasion
i i have another question on on uh like
so so first so you can so you said that
you can have a russian passport for
example or ukrainian passport and uh
well for ukrainian is not a problem at
all but you you can you could have a
russian passport and the proof of
address in any european country which
could be just electricity bill
and uh and and the bank and you would
open the account
correct yeah no problem i i have a
russian passport i live in the
netherlands um
but you do have a residential resident
permit in
so or you just need to provide a proof
of address
you just need to provide proof of
address i'm just living here it doesn't
matter if i have a residence permit or
on which
kind of
grounds i'm here yeah that's good to
know that's good to know
okay
yes
uh sorry if you have more questions i am
in uh
everscale community and you can send me
okay can you send can you send me your
your telegram i will as another question
i have do you do you planning to do the
white labeling of this card
uh yes we do
okay so then we then we should talk
when we should talk
okay we will it will be for europe for
europe but yeah it's a it's on our
agenda
uh okay
and the same of course applies for the
mobile app once we have our crypto
wallet uh and the card in one place yeah
which we call easy pay 2.0 you can have
the app as a white label as well so you
you don't really need to have easy pay
card you can have just easy pay app
where you have all your crypto wallets
and then you can link any card to it
so it's also um an option
no no i'm more interested in invite
labeling the the current related
services and connect to another wallet
for example if possible and the vice
versa
yeah okay what about a uk resident
residence
are they can we can we um right okay so
i apologize right um
first of all like i said at the
beginning we need to use the raised hand
feature i'm gonna start insisting on
that please if genny with all due
respect um but
yes but please go ahead and this is the
last time
yeah
okay
kate thank you very much obviously it
was very interesting uh obviously there
are a lot of things that uh
i have my own questions i'm not gonna
voice them here i think i'm gonna i'm
gonna dm you myself because there's a
there's a lot of potential here um i did
want to say um joanne you did have your
hand raised was your question answered
uh
no but i just had a really simple
question i just want to know if i could
pay the card fee in the service fee and
ever or does that have to be fiat
that's it uh for for now it is a fiat
here now it's in euros okay
but it's interesting question yeah
to think and yeah guys again thanks a
lot uh for questions and
uh i'm really interested in the feedback
and because we are here for you trying
to uh develop everscale products
together so
any ideas for product improvements are
very welcome as well
thank you well that's what this is all
about it's all about the exchange right
we talk about community this isn't a you
know corporate conference or anything
like that you present we ask we go back
and forth we're all friends
it's the way it works and i also saw at
one point ben you had a question or
has your question been answered
and i i spoke in turn in low with my
hand my friend
okay
all right okay thank you very much again
let's underscore the fact that this was
a cool
cool presentation a lot of
a lot of marbles sort of rolling around
in my head and i have to think to myself
what what other what other
questions i'm gonna have but um yeah
very cool thank you kate thank you for
coming um okay listen uh
ben kind of a segway right there it's uh
time for our closing segment so hang on
um i don't know if this one's gonna be
one of my best but i'll try our creative
uh nuestro maestro always snappy never
slow here to tell us things that we
don't know ben's bits go for it brother
yeah you downplay yourself buddy that
was beautiful right i will keep it
snappy as ever and i'll be honest my
head's been very much busy with uh
something this week uh so maybe a bit
short i may miss one or two things so
sorry if you've been working on
something and i haven't picked up on it
uh but the bits i have seen so far there
are a bunch more tokens uh which have
been made available on everscale wallet
so again tokens going across the
functionality of the wallets brilliant
as well as the aforementioned uh serve
token sale and lend token sale i don't
believe it's a sale but you've also had
cube token which is launched this week
uh pokerton had a really cool tournament
again i think there was like three
thousand ever in prize pool which is
pretty cool for a very low entry uh
poker tournament amongst the community
uh there was another grant accepted by
the everest girl grants programme
identics.space
very cool haven't had much chance to
look into it uh our lovely joanne did a
very cool marketing ama with nikita from
the d5 alliance on what day are we on
today god i hate daylight savings friday
friday it was wasn't it yeah of course
so if you didn't see that there's a lot
of cool little questions maybe some
things you've been wondering which got
answered
and
i said i've been rather busy so like i
say if i've missed a few things
but
let's make sure i share sounds
here we go 30 seconds of your time to a
teaser to tease you can everyone see
that yeah
aces right my my personal favorite out
of these so i bet you can't guess what
the answer will be folks
who once disappeared for nearly three
months
was located in a forest where he'd had
been isolating with a llama named
brother rainbow
and when asked
and when asked to return to his post
replied
you don't understand
i'm a slave my time is not my own my
body is not my own
and kept repeating in a cracked and
tearful voice that he needed to please
the leaders
was that one shay guevara
so there you go yes i was particularly
proud of this game uh this week our
middle game was called sunny or shay and
uh yeah i mean justin sunset had a
pretty crazy life so yeah i'll be
releasing it in a couple of hours
basically i'm literally in case you
couldn't tell i hadn't put the de-esser
on that bloody clip then so sorry for
all the yeses uh but that's my bits
thank you everyone and uh yeah catch you
soon
thank you ben thank you very much
that was fun
yes it always is
okay uh
yeah uh look so
i think we we don't have youtube
questions but there was uh one question
that was written then let me see if i
can find it here um right so
uh
person writes um
regarding the everscale roadmap uh
that's on the website um
is it going to be edited or is this the
final version and if uh it is going to
be edited when
and the second part of the question is
it seems that only the first portion
of that roadmap has been uh executed
and um i gotta i got an answer for you
so first of all yes it will be edited um
and if you recall when we were first
having this weekly call and presented
the roadmap it was said that all of the
dates and timelines on it are to some
extent arbitrary
and that
it will you know
eventually become more and more succinct
more more
filtered
and the
individual responsible uh for that road
map and for the everscale website wants
you to know
that in the
uh
near nearest possible future the
community is going to see changes in the
roadmap the page is going to change
they're going to highlight what's been
done and what's in progress so
essentially don't rely on what you see
on the site right now um it's um
somewhat ambiguous so i hope that
answers your question so it's already
scheduled it's in the works
and we don't have any other questions
and if nobody else has any and michael
still has his hands up uh but i think
that's because he forgot to put it down
uh
we're done and thank you everybody for
coming leanne

who does oh alina yes yes yes yes please

call
