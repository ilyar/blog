hey everyone
hello
well it's so nice to see you here
will you be able to present the ssi
step four
not today unfortunately i'm not ready
because i'm on the way
okay
uh i left a few comments
yep let's have a look
okay let's wait a couple minutes
and let's begin
all right let's begin so uh we have not
that big agenda for today's uh but still
i welcome you everyone it's our
60-second weekly defined governance call
uh so we have a couple of news for today
so i will start from the contest updates
so actually we have uh one contest uh
that we discussed last time this is a
contest for the never the stable coin
stage two
uh so the contest is uh almost ready i'm
waiting for sergey from provenda to
finalize it and add the missing points
and right after that uh we will launch
it so he promised to do this over the
weekend because he is on the business
trip right now
uh
and the second news the second contest
that you may have seen on the forum is
uh
the ssi uh
stage four uh that was uh posted there
by vladimir khan who is here with us
today but unfortunately he's on the road
and cannot
tell uh too much about
the contest yet however
i recommend going there and
having a look in the content description
and leaving your comments
i have a few already uh i posted them to
vladimir
and
so i hope that we will polish the
contest uh till next time and uh
vladimir will provide the presentation
of what this council is going to be
about and we will launch it
um
the second news of today is the launch
of the everdao so um
let me
give you a history of this this product
so actually uh eva dao is based on the
bridge dao that was developed by the
brokers team and
in the uh expectance of
gov to o
so
we decided to
make a step further and deploy a
separate replica of the dao with
separate contracts based on the
robbed ever
as a vote in power
and now it is available at everdao.net
uh and you can go there take your
everest to give the voting power and uh
even vote for the first
uh proposal uh that is uh sitting here
sitting there
so uh if everything goes well so we will
definitely be going to the proposal
to accept everdao as a main
governance interface forever scale
and
moreover this is the first experience
for us to of launch the separate dao
that is not linked directly to to any
product so uh please report any bugs
found and
any any feedback on the ux ui part uh to
our groups uh to myself personally so uh
every comment is welcomed
uh so
uh well that's pretty for today so uh we
have not that rich agenda now uh
hopefully so we will get more and more
news uh
with the launch of of the foundation and
you may have seen few news from the
grand
team as well that
more and more projects appearing on our
horizon
uh
so
yeah guys if you have any questions
please so we
have a really short meeting today
okay really no questions
uh
uh in this case so i i thank everyone
for joining
sorry sorry can you just deliberate more
on everdoe like what's um
yeah so i can even share my
my screen and explain a bit uh how it
works
uh so give me a second
because it's kind of important
yeah so uh it's pretty straightforward
product so it's uh nothing that where
you can
can mess actually uh so
let me show it like this
yeah so uh you see here
i everdao.net
so this is the domain of the product so
there are actually two tabs so one is
taking another is the governance so uh
in the staking part uh so you can
stake your roped levers
directly here so you see i have some
balance here available so i can do this
now so for example i would like to stake
some additional levers
just seconds up
i will
copy my password
so uh if you don't see there's a
wallet screen appeared right now so now
it's been staked
and
meanwhile it is done so you can see that
there is a redeem window so i have about
one of one weber
available here and here are some
transactions that they did
so
while it has been staked so you can go
to the uh governance interface
governance dashboard directly so as it
shows how many reserves are currently
available in the dow system so how many
uh stakeholders
have put the webbers there how many
proposals are available also some chart
with tvl uh launched
locked in the dow
uh the recent proposals it will uh be
the top proposal something like three to
five so we
i think five
is the right number now
so and here you can see the top voters
by the power
uh actually this is uh pretty much uh
copying the best practices from
existing dao interfaces
like compound or other finance
or other defined products so and
it incorporates the best practices from
from
the governance systems uh here you can
click on on the proposal and dive into
its uh
its
page
uh you will see here
the step that's which the proposal is
now uh
staying so there are actually uh four
steps the first one is the pending when
the proposal is published and it stays
there for everyone to review
at this stage the proposer can uh cancel
it and
it it can be cancelled until it's uh
queued so for all this period of time so
typically this stays as a two days
configuration but this can be changed
through the dow decision as well by the
way so every parameter here so like the
quorum parameter or
uh the duration of those steps can be
changed by by the dow decision
next it will uh be the voting period so
now it's it's configured to be three
days for voting but it can be reduced
uh then the lockup period to let uh
everyone uh if they are not agreeing
with this uh dow decision to take
actions and then it's the decisions
being executed
uh so uh here you see the current
distribution of the votings uh so you
can vote not only for the proposal but
also against the proposal and uh
actually the
voting is pretty uh straightforward
so uh
it should reach the minimum quorum of
votes so meaning that at least
500 000 webers should participate in the
voting it's not only
for but also uh in against
and uh you can vote for or against the
proposal as i said so yet if you the
proposal gets more votes uh then against
votes so it's the
considered accepted
um
here you will see the description uh
the description can be written in the
markdown and is stored directly in the
uh contract uh so there is a discussion
page so that can be uh configured to
anything uh so that you can put in the
field at the moment of the proposal
creation uh here are some uh everscale
actions so actually
the dao proposal can have actions inside
it that smart contract calls and
we will also write a guide on how to
uh create those actions so it's not that
complex so actually what it contains is
a target smart contract to call and the
encoded payload uh to attach to this
smart contract call and also some
payload balance that you need to attach
when sending the message
and once the dao is accepted and at the
execution stage it will call this
specific contract uh with this payload
and the dash this amount so actually now
this contract if i remember it well it
is the
uh eho contract so and the encoded
payload say it's sounds like hello
so when you send it to it just send it
back
uh here you'll see the address of the
proposal uh the voting start date the
voting end date and
the period of course
once anyone votes uh for or against the
proposal so uh his vote will appear here
he can provide some comment why he's
deciding this or that
and also what is important that for the
duration of
the
voting period the your stake will be
locked so once you vote so you will not
be able to
cancel your vote or withdraw your stake
until the vote is over so this is also
important because it guarantees that
there are no
fake votes
so uh
and here also the create proposal uh
interface so you need to have the stake
of at least 100 000
efforts here
to
make a new proposal so this is also some
economic uh
spam protection system so and this also
can be increased or decreased based on
the dow decision
um yeah so that's pretty it i think
that's uh
nothing nothing really to tell more
about this but here you see the list of
proposals
and you see my voting power has doubled
now i have two errors here so
that i can vote within
one day seven hours and 17 minutes
thank you looks really cool any plans
for everest not wrapped but but simple
evers
currently we are testing it and uh
probably we um
we have a cool feature coming uh on flat
cube that will allow you to uh
uh also make exchange directly from your
ever balance
and
once it is uh
really well tested and
in in the production so i think that we
will also edit here so to to
make the
uh under the hood conversion of average
to webbers so uh
again uh wearers are here to
reduce the complexity of the system and
avoid
major errors
any more questions guys please
all right um in this case so uh i thank
everyone for for attending so and uh
keep an eye on the forum and on the
governance interface and uh
see you all next week so uh hopefully
there will be a presentation of the ssi
contest stage four and uh we will
get some more news yeah maybe from other
teams
okay
have a nice day
see you
bye
