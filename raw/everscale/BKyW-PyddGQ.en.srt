183
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,310
again as you know who was uh responsible
for all

184
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
for all
 

185
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,990
for all
uh

186
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
uh
 

187
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,790
uh
uh design this was

188
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800

 

189
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,270

all product design

190
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
all product design
 

191
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,469
all product design
decisions

192
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
decisions
 

193
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,749
decisions
and

194
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
and
 

195
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,629
and
uh

196
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
uh
 

197
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,150
uh
it worked

198
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
it worked
 

199
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,070
it worked
somehow in the beginning and actually it

200
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
somehow in the beginning and actually it
 

201
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,230
somehow in the beginning and actually it
works well so we delivered another

202
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
works well so we delivered another
 

203
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,590
works well so we delivered another
delivery

204
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
delivery
 

205
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,830
delivery
wanted to deliver other very important

206
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
wanted to deliver other very important
 

207
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,390
wanted to deliver other very important
products like sdk compilers

208
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
products like sdk compilers
 

209
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,270
products like sdk compilers
but

210
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
but
 

211
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,990
but
it is impossible for a single person to

212
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
it is impossible for a single person to
 

213
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,430
it is impossible for a single person to
manage

214
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
manage
 

215
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,870
manage
efficiently

216
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
efficiently
 

217
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,590
efficiently
all

218
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
all
 

219
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,270
all
those streams

220
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
those streams
 

221
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,310
those streams
so finally we made internal decision to

222
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320

 

223
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,189

make

224
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
make
 

225
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,950
make
each project

226
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
each project
 

227
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,029
each project
as a

228
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
as a
 

229
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,510
as a
fully fledged separate team which

230
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
fully fledged separate team which
 

231
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,430
fully fledged separate team which
focused only

232
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
focused only
 

233
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,230
focused only
on that project with the lead with the

234
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
on that project with the lead with the
 

235
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,990
on that project with the lead with the
team

236
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
team
 

237
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,350
team
for each project

238
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
for each project
 

239
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,469
for each project
so what we can now we have now ever

240
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
so what we can now we have now ever
 

241
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,909
so what we can now we have now ever
known

242
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
known
 

243
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,950
known
the most

244
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
the most
 

245
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,189
the most
probably probably the most important

246
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
probably probably the most important
 

247
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,550
probably probably the most important
company because

248
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
company because
 

249
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,909
company because
the network itself then we have uh

250
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
the network itself then we have uh
 

251
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,270
the network itself then we have uh
a sdk

252
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
a sdk
 

253
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,469
a sdk
slash cloud uh infrastructure which

254
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
slash cloud uh infrastructure which
 

255
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,530
slash cloud uh infrastructure which
which is called uh evernote platform

256
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:06,540
which is called uh evernote platform
 

257
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,990
which is called uh evernote platform

259
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,710

so

260
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
so
 

261
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,070
so
then we have

262
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
then we have
 

263
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,469
then we have
compilers

264
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
compilers
 

265
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,230
compilers
your famous compiler

266
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
your famous compiler
 

267
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,469
your famous compiler
again probably some of you

268
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
again probably some of you
 

269
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,350
again probably some of you
use

270
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
use
 

271
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,029
use
so those those are three uh core

272
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:21,039
so those those are three uh core
 

273
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,070
so those those are three uh core
streams which everything's

274
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,080

so they have separate streams and they

296
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
so they have separate streams and they
 

297
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:39,749
so they have separate streams and they
could have

00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839

 

347
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,829

uh yeah basically behind the

348
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839
uh yeah basically behind the
 

349
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,990
uh yeah basically behind the
team meaning our team

350

team meaning our team
 

351
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,070
team meaning our team
basically uh

352
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,080
basically uh
 

353
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,949
basically uh
we

354
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
we
 

355
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,070
we
have to follow

356
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080

 

357
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,829

different ways of

358
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
different ways of
 

359
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,430
different ways of
some kind of

360
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
some kind of
 

361
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,430
some kind of
different ways of thinking so we have to

362
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
different ways of thinking so we have to
 

363
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,710
different ways of thinking so we have to
develop

364
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
develop
 

365
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,750
develop

00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
to the future and to
 

397
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,389
to the future and to

00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
get a good product
 

399
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,550
get a good product
in the end of

400
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560
in the end of
 

401
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,910
in the end of
our road

402
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
our road
 

403
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,070
our road
so

404
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
so
 

405
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,030
so
that is our common understanding how we

406
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
that is our common understanding how we
 

407
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,990
that is our common understanding how we
should

408
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
should
 

409
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,790
should
how we should do

410
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800

 

411
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,389

briefly
 

421
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,069
briefly
explain what streams uh you have

422
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,079
explain what streams uh you have
 

423
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,470
explain what streams uh you have
internally in the team uh regarding smft

424

internally in the team uh regarding smft
 

425
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,190
internally in the team uh regarding smft
concerns about ramp uh

426
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
concerns about ramp uh
 

427
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,790
concerns about ramp uh
and so like

428
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
and so like

to move our blockchain towards to the
 

485
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,509
to move our blockchain towards to the
future so we found some cases like

486
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
future so we found some cases like
 

487
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,100
future so we found some cases like
multiple work chains and some

488
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,110
multiple work chains and some
 

489
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,230

reasonable time
 

527
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,629
reasonable time
uh with some steps that can be

528
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
uh with some steps that can be
 

529
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,269
uh with some steps that can be
monitoring with uh with the help of

530
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
monitoring with uh with the help of
 

531
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,790
monitoring with uh with the help of
community so we'll prepare a plan

532
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:18,800
community so we'll prepare a plan
 

533
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,269
community so we'll prepare a plan
and we'll review this community guys and

and we'll review this community guys and
 

535
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,030
and we'll review this community guys and
then we can

536
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
then we can
 

537
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,670
then we can
follow the development steps

538
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
follow the development steps
 

539
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,150
follow the development steps
so exactly the topics that we should

540
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,160
so exactly the topics that we should
 

541
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,230

follow with the
 

543
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,230
follow with the
multiple chain items the drive chain and

544
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
multiple chain items the drive chain and
 

545
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,190
multiple chain items the drive chain and
the

546
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
the
 

547
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,509
the
slashing mechanisms

548
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
slashing mechanisms
 

549
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,910
slashing mechanisms
inside the work chain or sorry inside

550
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
inside the work chain or sorry inside
 

551
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,310
inside the work chain or sorry inside
the blockchain

552
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
the blockchain
 

553
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,670
the blockchain
so

554
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680

 

555
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,629

i think that we had a lot of a lot of a

556
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:48,639
i think that we had a lot of a lot of a
 

557
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,949
i think that we had a lot of a lot of a
lot of questions to discuss but maybe

558
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:50,959
lot of questions to discuss but maybe
 

559
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:58,069
lot of questions to discuss but maybe
this video is the most important thing

560
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,079

 

561
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,509

yeah let me

562
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
yeah let me
 

563
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,430
yeah let me
file a little bit

564
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
file a little bit
 

565
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,910
file a little bit
so slavo was talking that about

566
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
so slavo was talking that about
 

567
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,470
so slavo was talking that about
the fact that those priorities like

568
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,480
the fact that those priorities like
 

569
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,389
the fact that those priorities like
blockchains and flashing they were set

570
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
blockchains and flashing they were set
 

571
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,230
blockchains and flashing they were set
up by a community

572
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,240
up by a community
 

573
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,870
up by a community
uh we had our

574
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
uh we had our
 

575
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,509
uh we had our
own agenda as you know we are

576
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
own agenda as you know we are

not not team focused on delivering uh

578
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:18,560
not not team focused on delivering uh
 

579
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,389
not not team focused on delivering uh
features uh what were mentioned in white

580
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
features uh what were mentioned in white
 

581
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,990
features uh what were mentioned in white
paper which

582
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,000
paper which
 

583
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,310
paper which
is probably already almost a year from

584
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
is probably already almost a year from
 

585
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,110
is probably already almost a year from
now

586
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
now

was published
uh

590
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
uh
 

591
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,470
uh
but uh community

592
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:32,480
but uh community
 

593
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,269
but uh community
members of the skill community uh on

594
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
members of the skill community uh on
 

595
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,030

architectural committee

596
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,040
architectural committee
 

597
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,750
architectural committee
uh said that okay we need this and these

598
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:39,760
uh said that okay we need this and these
 

599
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,230
uh said that okay we need this and these
features uh delivered a sub

600
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
features uh delivered a sub
 

601
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,069
features uh delivered a sub
so some features were

602
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079

 

603
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,710

got less priority and those features

604
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
got less priority and those features
 

605
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,389
got less priority and those features
which

606
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:50,399
which
 

607
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,470
which
as well mentioned they got highest

608
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
as well mentioned they got highest
 

609
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,910
as well mentioned they got highest
priority

610
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
priority
 

611
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,710
priority
so

612
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
so
 

613
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,710
so
as as of now

614
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
as as of now
 

615
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,430
as as of now
there are two

616
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,440

 

617
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,230

most

618
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
most
 

619
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,710
most
wanted uh features uh

620
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
wanted uh features uh
 

621
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,750
wanted uh features uh
multiple watch support multiple chains

622
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:05,760
multiple watch support multiple chains
 

623
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,069
multiple watch support multiple chains
and uh which by the way includes uh

624
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
and uh which by the way includes uh
 

625
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,069
and uh which by the way includes uh
messaging between world chains as well

626
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:10,079
messaging between world chains as well
 

627
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,790
messaging between world chains as well
and uh another feature is slashing for

628
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:12,800
and uh another feature is slashing for
 

629
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,389
and uh another feature is slashing for
validators which you can perform their

630
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:14,399
validators which you can perform their
 

631
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,949
validators which you can perform their
digits

632
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
digits
 

633
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:17,910
digits
other

634
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
other
 

635
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,870
other
other

636
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
other
 

637
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,829
other
uh

638
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:19,839
uh
 

639
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,150
uh
bottoms actually there's nothing

640
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160

 

641
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,910

always important in

642
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:27,920

 

643
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,430

roadmap

644
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:29,440
roadmap
 

645
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,030
roadmap
you cannot say that

646
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,040
you cannot say that
 

647
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,509
you cannot say that
some part of that roadmap is not

648
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519
some part of that roadmap is not
 

649
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,710
some part of that roadmap is not
important

650
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,720
important
 

651
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,230
important
but

652
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:38,240

 

653
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,030

it is

654
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,040

 

655
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,069

implementation uh and go into production

656
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:46,079
implementation uh and go into production
 

657
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,990
implementation uh and go into production
it will be in stages

658
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,000
it will be in stages
 

659
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,670
it will be in stages
uh so

660
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
uh so
 

661
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,870
uh so
uh

662
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
uh
 

663
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,430
uh
ram ram which long

664
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
ram ram which long
 

665
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,949
ram ram which long
long time weighted ram uh it will be

666
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:56,959
long time weighted ram uh it will be
 

667
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,550
long time weighted ram uh it will be
uh

668
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
uh
 

669
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,189
uh
open source

670
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:01,199
open source
 

671
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,110
open source
as we discussed

672
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,120
as we discussed
 

673
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,829
as we discussed
this week

674
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:05,839

 

675
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,069

and it is

676
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
and it is
 

677
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,470
and it is
it did already for a couple of months in

678
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
it did already for a couple of months in
 

679
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:17,990
it did already for a couple of months in
tests

680
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000

 

681
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,110

system can take some time and

682
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
system can take some time and
 

683
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,949
system can take some time and
quite honest unpredictable amount of

684
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:22,959
quite honest unpredictable amount of
 

685
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,949
quite honest unpredictable amount of
time to take so that's why

686
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
time to take so that's why
 

687
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,509
time to take so that's why
we decided not to

688
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:27,519
we decided not to
 

689
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,629
we decided not to
develop it in a hidden way because

690
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:30,639
develop it in a hidden way because
 

691
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,430
develop it in a hidden way because
we'd like to convince you also to

692
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
we'd like to convince you also to
 

693
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,030
we'd like to convince you also to
provide some opinion on that and

694
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,040
provide some opinion on that and
 

695
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,189
provide some opinion on that and
probably provide some help with finding

696
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
probably provide some help with finding
 

697
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,110
probably provide some help with finding
bugs so it will be uh open source by the

698
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
bugs so it will be uh open source by the
 

699
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,870
bugs so it will be uh open source by the
end of this week

700
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:42,880
end of this week
 

701
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,509
end of this week
so the same situation with the first

702
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
so the same situation with the first
 

703
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,310
so the same situation with the first
uh

704

those who should be available by the end
 

711
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,870
those who should be available by the end
of this week

712
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880

 

713
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,310

um

714

yeah
 

717
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,870
yeah
we have a fully capable team for deliver

718
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880

 

719
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,790

all features

720
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
all features
 

721
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,110
all features
mentioned in the white paper

722
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120

 

723
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,870

of course there should be some

724
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:14,880
of course there should be some
 

725
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,269
of course there should be some
implementation uh fluctuations in

726
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279
implementation uh fluctuations in
 

727
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,590
implementation uh fluctuations in
implementation dependent fluctuations

728
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
implementation dependent fluctuations

and
 

803
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,470
and
so on

804
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:50,480
so on
 

805
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,990
so on
and

806
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
and
 

807
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,350
and
then we

808
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,360
then we
 

809
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,110
then we
validate this hypothesis that

810
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
validate this hypothesis that
 

811
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,789
validate this hypothesis that
users want

812
00:17:58,789 --> 00:17:58,799
users want
 

813
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,270
users want
say sometimes someone wants to implement

814
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,280
say sometimes someone wants to implement
 

815
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,310
say sometimes someone wants to implement
some great feature that

816
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
some great feature that
 

817
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,470
some great feature that
they they're sure they're really great

818
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,480
they they're sure they're really great
 

819
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,110
they they're sure they're really great
and uh we do not take features in

820
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
and uh we do not take features in
 

821
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,390
and uh we do not take features in
development immediately we go and i go

822
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:12,400
development immediately we go and i go
 

823
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,909
development immediately we go and i go
and ask

824
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:13,919
and ask
 

825
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,470
and ask
developers if they need it or they don't

826
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
developers if they need it or they don't
 

827
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,590
developers if they need it or they don't
and many features were

828
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600
and many features were
 

829
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,549
and many features were
rejected or trashed this way so

830
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:24,559

 

831
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,430

then

832
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
then
 

833
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,510
then
we prioritize

834
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:27,520
we prioritize
 

835
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,430
we prioritize
features

836
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:29,440
features
 

837
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,470
features
and

838
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
and
 

839
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,310
and
then we develop them

840
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
then we develop them
 

841
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,510
then we develop them
development is a process that itself

842
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
development is a process that itself
 

843
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,270
development is a process that itself
consists of many

844
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,280
consists of many
 

845
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,150
consists of many
um

846
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,160
um
 

847

now
 

901
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,270
now
and we understand that this is a problem

902
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280
and we understand that this is a problem
 

903
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,950
and we understand that this is a problem
for users who do not

00:19:59,430 --> 00:19:59,440
implement balancing
 

911
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,470
implement balancing
and

912
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:00,480
and
 

913
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,549
and
we decided to

914
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:02,559
we decided to
 

915
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,190
we decided to
release this reliable endpoints and we

916
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,200
release this reliable endpoints and we
 

917
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,630
release this reliable endpoints and we
will balance on the backend on our site

918
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640
will balance on the backend on our site
 

919
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,750
will balance on the backend on our site
and these endpoints will go

920
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:11,760
and these endpoints will go
 

921
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,750
and these endpoints will go
uh these endpoints users will receive

922
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:15,760
uh these endpoints users will receive
 

923
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,110
uh these endpoints users will receive
after the registration in the dashboard

924
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,120
after the registration in the dashboard
 

925
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,510
after the registration in the dashboard
and also

926
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:21,520
and also
 

927
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,350
and also
they will receive authorization

928
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:23,360
they will receive authorization
 

929
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,789
they will receive authorization
credentials

930
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799
credentials
 

931
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,870
credentials
um there will be

932
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880
um there will be
 

933
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,549
um there will be
ways to authorize with project id

934
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:30,559
ways to authorize with project id
 

935
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,549
ways to authorize with project id
with a basic authorization with secret

936
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
with a basic authorization with secret
 

937
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,029
with a basic authorization with secret
and

938
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:37,039

 

939
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,990

later we will add support for gbt tokens

940
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,000

 

941
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,149

and this authorization will become

942
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:44,159
and this authorization will become
 

943
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,110
and this authorization will become
mandatory by september 22 so in one

944
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
mandatory by september 22 so in one
 

945
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,549
mandatory by september 22 so in one
month and i think uh i hope we will

946
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:50,559
month and i think uh i hope we will
 

947
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,350
month and i think uh i hope we will
release dashboard this week

948
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,360
release dashboard this week
 

949
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,430
release dashboard this week
um

950
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
um
 

951
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,789
um
so

952
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:56,799
so
 

953
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,110
so
this is the like nearest

954
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,120
this is the like nearest
 

955
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,390
this is the like nearest
uh future

956
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:00,400
uh future
 

957
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,950
uh future
and also in parallel now we develop

958
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:02,960
and also in parallel now we develop
 

959
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,190
and also in parallel now we develop
token api

960
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,200
token api
 

961
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,230
token api
um the reason why we were not developing

962
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
um the reason why we were not developing
 

963
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,029
um the reason why we were not developing
it

964
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,039
it
 

965
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,669
it
didn't uh haven't started developing it

966
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:11,679
didn't uh haven't started developing it
 

967
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:12,789
didn't uh haven't started developing it
earlier

968
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:12,799
earlier
 

969
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,149
earlier
is because there was no standard for

970
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:16,159
is because there was no standard for
 

971
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,549
is because there was no standard for
tokens and

972
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:18,559
tokens and
 

973
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,830
tokens and
um

974
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,840
um
 

975
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,430
um
we wanted

976
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:21,440
we wanted
 

977
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,190
we wanted
the community to

978
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:23,200
the community to
 

979
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,270
the community to
standardize it so

980
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:25,280
standardize it so
 

981
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,310
standardize it so
now we have a standard but this standard

982
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,320
now we have a standard but this standard
 

983
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,350
now we have a standard but this standard
tip31 is also not

984
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,360
tip31 is also not
 

985
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,950
tip31 is also not
a complete standard actually we

986
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:32,960
a complete standard actually we
 

987
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,110
a complete standard actually we
implement api on top of

988
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,120
implement api on top of
 

989
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,830
implement api on top of
uh tip 3.2

990
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:37,840
uh tip 3.2
 

991
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,710
uh tip 3.2
which is not uh

992
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:40,720
which is not uh
 

993
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,710
which is not uh
accepted i think but

994
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:42,720
accepted i think but
 

995
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,789
accepted i think but
brooks has already

996
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:44,799
brooks has already
 

997
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,990
brooks has already
have its description in the github so

998
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,000
have its description in the github so
 

999
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,029
have its description in the github so
because tip31 is it covers only

1000
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:51,039
because tip31 is it covers only
 

1001
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,590
because tip31 is it covers only
transfers standardization not ownership

1002
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:53,600
transfers standardization not ownership
 

1003
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,190
transfers standardization not ownership
and stuff like that

1004
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,200
and stuff like that
 

1005
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,710
and stuff like that
so

1006
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:56,720
so
 

1007
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,190
so
we will release token api on top of tip

1008
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,200
we will release token api on top of tip
 

1009
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,470
we will release token api on top of tip
3

1010
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:00,480
3
 

1011
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,430
3
to

1012
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:01,440
to
 

1013
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,549
to
standard

1014
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:02,559
standard
 

1015
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,149
standard
uh

1016
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:04,159
uh
 

1017
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,549
uh
and then we will add project analytics

1018
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
and then we will add project analytics
 

1019
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,510
and then we will add project analytics
to

1020
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:07,520
to
 

1021
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,110
to
the dashboard

1022
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,120
the dashboard
 

1023
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,110
the dashboard
it will uh project analytics means the

1024
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,120
it will uh project analytics means the
 

1025
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,750
it will uh project analytics means the
api usage of the project so

1026
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:15,760
api usage of the project so
 

1027
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,029
api usage of the project so
uh projects will see uh what requests

1028
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:19,039
uh projects will see uh what requests
 

1029
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,549
uh projects will see uh what requests
they do how often uh how often they meet

1030
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:22,559
they do how often uh how often they meet
 

1031
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,549
they do how often uh how often they meet
limits and

1032
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:24,559
limits and
 

1033
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,590
limits and
stuff like that and later we will um

1034
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
stuff like that and later we will um
 

1035
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,750
stuff like that and later we will um
start calculating uh

1036
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:31,760
start calculating uh
 

1037
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,470
start calculating uh
query costs and based on that those

1038
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,480
query costs and based on that those
 

1039
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,669
query costs and based on that those
costs

1040
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:35,679
costs
 

1041
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,430
costs
we will add access limit policy

1042
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
we will add access limit policy
 

1043
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,070
we will add access limit policy
um

1044
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,080

 

1045
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,350

and

1046
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,360
and
 

1047
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,310
and
later we will when we do some analysis

1048
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,320
later we will when we do some analysis
 

1049
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,070
later we will when we do some analysis
based on api usage we will

1050
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,080
based on api usage we will
 

1051
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,630
based on api usage we will
introduce some subscription tiers and it

1052
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:52,640
introduce some subscription tiers and it
 

1053
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,270
introduce some subscription tiers and it
will be of course freemium model

1054
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:55,280
will be of course freemium model
 

1055
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,310
will be of course freemium model
so the free subscription

1056
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,320
so the free subscription
 

1057
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,990
so the free subscription
if you have low uh requests uh

1058
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
if you have low uh requests uh
 

1059
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,310
if you have low uh requests uh
lower number of requests you

1060
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320
lower number of requests you
 

1061
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,270
lower number of requests you
may use free subscription and if you

1062
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:07,280
may use free subscription and if you
 

1063
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,669
may use free subscription and if you
have higher

1064
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:09,679
have higher
 

1065
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,430
have higher
number of requests of course you will

1066
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:11,440
number of requests of course you will
 

1067
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,789
number of requests of course you will
need to buy

1068
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
need to buy
 

1069
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,430
need to buy
a more

1070
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:15,440
a more
 

1071
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,350
a more
costly like subscription

1072
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
costly like subscription
 

1073
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,230
costly like subscription
and in terms of another

1074
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,240
and in terms of another
 

1075
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,669
and in terms of another
features that we plan to implement

1076
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:23,679
features that we plan to implement
 

1077
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,310
features that we plan to implement
its nft api

1078
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
its nft api
 

1079
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,510
its nft api
um

1080
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:27,520
um
 

1081
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,230
um
also because the standard was now in the

1082
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:30,240
also because the standard was now in the
 

1083
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,750
also because the standard was now in the
process of accept acceptance

1084
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:33,760
process of accept acceptance
 

1085
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,390
process of accept acceptance
um

1086
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:36,400
um
 

1087
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,870
um
so

1088
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:38,880

 

1089
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,710

this is it for ever cloud

1090
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
this is it for ever cloud
 

1091
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,470
this is it for ever cloud
uh priorities and roadmap and sdk

1092
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:46,480
uh priorities and roadmap and sdk
 

1093
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,110
uh priorities and roadmap and sdk
roadmap is shorter

1094
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,120
roadmap is shorter
 

1095
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,549
roadmap is shorter
we plan to

1096
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:50,559
we plan to
 

1097
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,470
we plan to
introduce based on the feedback of

1098
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:52,480
introduce based on the feedback of
 

1099
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,390
introduce based on the feedback of
developers we want to

1100
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:54,400
developers we want to
 

1101
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,510
developers we want to
duplicate upkid and introduce another

1102
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,520
duplicate upkid and introduce another
 

1103
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,029
duplicate upkid and introduce another
web3 like contract package

1104
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:01,039
web3 like contract package
 

1105
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,669
web3 like contract package
in some time i don't know maybe a couple

1106
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:03,679
in some time i don't know maybe a couple
 

1107
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,669
in some time i don't know maybe a couple
of months

1108
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:05,679
of months
 

1109
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,470
of months
um it will be like web 3 the js

1110
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
um it will be like web 3 the js
 

1111
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,549
um it will be like web 3 the js
libraries

1112
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:12,559

 

1113
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,710

so it will be more

1114
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:14,720
so it will be more
 

1115
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,470
so it will be more
convenient for developers to use

1116
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:18,480
convenient for developers to use
 

1117
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,950
convenient for developers to use
also the engine will be removed from

1118
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:20,960
also the engine will be removed from
 

1119
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,110
also the engine will be removed from
sdk it will be first duplicated now

1120
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,120
sdk it will be first duplicated now
 

1121
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,070
sdk it will be first duplicated now
um

1122
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,080
um
 

1123
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,590
um
because surf team wants to develop it uh

1124
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:29,600
because surf team wants to develop it uh
 

1125
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,669
because surf team wants to develop it uh
separately

1126
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:31,679
separately
 

1127
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,789
separately
and

1128
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:32,799
and
 

1129
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,390
and
also sdk

1130
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:34,400
also sdk
 

1131
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,669
also sdk
binary became pretty big so it's a good

1132
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:37,679
binary became pretty big so it's a good
 

1133
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,070
binary became pretty big so it's a good
idea to remove the engine from

1134
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,080
idea to remove the engine from
 

1135
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,029
idea to remove the engine from
from it

1136
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:41,039
from it
 

1137
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,269
from it
and later

1138
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:43,279
and later
 

1139
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,110
and later
i don't know when but we will

1140
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,120
i don't know when but we will
 

1141
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,230
i don't know when but we will
release sdk 2.0

1142
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,240
release sdk 2.0
 

1143
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,870
release sdk 2.0
and probably will make it more modular

1144
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:50,880
and probably will make it more modular
 

1145
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,149
and probably will make it more modular
because uh some users say that

1146
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:54,159
because uh some users say that
 

1147
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,269
because uh some users say that
having two megabytes binary with wasm in

1148
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:57,279
having two megabytes binary with wasm in
 

1149
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,950
having two megabytes binary with wasm in
the web is a problem

1150
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:00,960

 

1151
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,870

i personally think that's not a problem

1152
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:04,880

 

1153
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,310

because

1154
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,320
because
 

1155
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,630
because
the main

1156
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:08,640
the main
 

1157
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,909
the main

1158
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:09,919

like products that use sdk are either
 

1161
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,310
like products that use sdk are either

often sdk is used in the web

1168
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:25,679
often sdk is used in the web
 

1169
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,549
often sdk is used in the web
like

1170
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:28,559
like
 

1171
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,870
like
you know on the in the page like itself

1172
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:30,880
you know on the in the page like itself
 

1173
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,750
you know on the in the page like itself
so

1174
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:31,760
so
 

1175
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,870
so
um

1176
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:32,880
um
 

1177
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,950
um
i'm not sure like maybe we will not do

1178
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:34,960
i'm not sure like maybe we will not do
 

1179
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,510
i'm not sure like maybe we will not do
it modular but maybe we will like we

1180
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:37,520
it modular but maybe we will like we
 

1181
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,830
it modular but maybe we will like we
continue this uh hypothesis

1182
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:40,840
continue this uh hypothesis
 

1183
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,909
continue this uh hypothesis
testing um

1184
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:43,919
testing um
 

1185
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,190
testing um
and here is the short road map for

1186
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,200
and here is the short road map for
 

1187
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,430
and here is the short road map for

we plan to

1190
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:51,039
we plan to
 

1191
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,350
we plan to
increase test execution time it has

1192
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:53,360
increase test execution time it has
 

1193
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,870
increase test execution time it has
already in

1194
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:54,880
already in
 

1195
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,669
already in
oh i mean decrease test execution time

1196
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:57,679
oh i mean decrease test execution time
 

1197
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,549
oh i mean decrease test execution time
of course uh we already decreased it two

1198
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
of course uh we already decreased it two
 

1199
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,430
of course uh we already decreased it two
times in the last version

1200
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:03,440
times in the last version
 

1201
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,510
times in the last version
tests around two times faster now but we

1202
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:05,520
tests around two times faster now but we
 

1203
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,470
tests around two times faster now but we
plan to decrease it more

1204
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:08,480
plan to decrease it more
 

1205
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,310
plan to decrease it more
uh hopefully to reach the same uh speed

1206
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,320
uh hopefully to reach the same uh speed
 

1207
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,870
uh hopefully to reach the same uh speed
as in ganache

1208

new uh block explorer
you can find it on the beta ever scan

1484
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:51,840
you can find it on the beta ever scan
 

1485
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,830
you can find it on the beta ever scan
so basically it has

1486
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:53,840
so basically it has
 

1487
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,389
so basically it has
the functionality which the current

error scale smart contracts as i know
 

1505
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,870
error scale smart contracts as i know
this one is dow root of the error scan

1506
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:18,880
this one is dow root of the error scan
 

1507
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,029
this one is dow root of the error scan
so as you see the

1508

so as you see the
 

1509
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,350
so as you see the
uh code is verified the api and so on

1510
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,360
uh code is verified the api and so on
 

1511

read the details directly from the
 

1521
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,070
read the details directly from the
smart contract or you can send some

1522
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,080
smart contract or you can send some
 

1523
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,630

which is called debugger as i know there

1550
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,080
which is called debugger as i know there
 

1551
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,430
which is called debugger as i know there
was no uh similar projects in the ever

1552
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,440
was no uh similar projects in the ever
 

1553
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,710

product i don't know uh we still have to

1562
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,200
product i don't know uh we still have to
 

1563
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,389
product i don't know uh we still have to
found out uh by using this you can

1564
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:38,399
found out uh by using this you can
 

1565
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,149
found out uh by using this you can
literally debug every single uh smart

1566
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:42,159
literally debug every single uh smart
 

1567
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,350
literally debug every single uh smart
contract transaction in the every scale

1568
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:45,360
contract transaction in the every scale
 

1569
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,549
contract transaction in the every scale
you can see

1570
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:46,559
you can see
 

1571
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,269
you can see
let's say the uh

1572
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:49,279
let's say the uh
 

1573
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,909
let's say the uh
all the op codes that were executed in

1574
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:51,919
all the op codes that were executed in
 

1575
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,870
all the op codes that were executed in
the action phase you can see this stack

1576
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:54,880
the action phase you can see this stack
 

1577
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,070
the action phase you can see this stack
on the right

1578
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,080
on the right
 

1579
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,590
on the right
so you know right now it is a lot easier

1580
00:33:59,590 --> 00:33:59,600
so you know right now it is a lot easier
 

1581

to debug your uh reverted transactions
 

1583
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,870
to debug your uh reverted transactions
if something went wrong uh maybe

1584
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:06,880
if something went wrong uh maybe
 

1585
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,750
if something went wrong uh maybe

projects but at the end we are in a

1772
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:38,720
projects but at the end we are in a
 

1773
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,550
projects but at the end we are in a
competitive environment

1774
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:40,560
competitive environment
 

1775
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,550
competitive environment
so we should look around we should see

1776
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:42,560
so we should look around we should see
 

1777
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,910
so we should look around we should see
what's going on in

1778
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:45,920

 

1779
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,230

going on in other blockchains and

1780
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,240
going on in other blockchains and
 

1781
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,470
going on in other blockchains and
we should do as a community

1782
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:50,480
we should do as a community
 

1783
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,910
we should do as a community
business in a way

1784
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:51,920
business in a way
 

1785
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,470
business in a way
uh that

1786
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:54,480
uh that
 

1787
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,030
uh that
we should uh

1788
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,040
we should uh
 

1789
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,030
we should uh
try to get the best projects and uh to

1790
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,040
try to get the best projects and uh to
 

1791
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,310
try to get the best projects and uh to
get the most developers attention and

1792
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,320
get the most developers attention and
 

1793
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,950
get the most developers attention and
most developing team attention

1794
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:06,960
most developing team attention
 

1795
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,829
most developing team attention
so

1796
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:07,839
so
 

1797
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,030
so
that's why

1798
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,040
that's why
 

1799
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,790
that's why
there was a push strong push from

1800
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:10,800
there was a push strong push from
 

1801
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,190
there was a push strong push from
community from key members

1802
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,200
community from key members
 

1803
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,550
community from key members
to

1804
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:14,560
to
 

1805
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,630
to
create such mechanism where we

1806
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:18,640
create such mechanism where we
 

1807
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,510
create such mechanism where we
actually

1808
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:19,520
actually
 

1809
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,430
actually
assess what priorities should be

1810
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:23,440
assess what priorities should be
 

1811
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,470
assess what priorities should be
should be

1812
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:24,480
should be
 

1813
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,829
should be
done in first place and what

1814
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:27,839
done in first place and what
 

1815
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,589
done in first place and what
can we

1816
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:29,599
can we
 

1817
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,790
can we
at the end

1818
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:30,800
at the end
 

1819
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,310
at the end
that architecture

1820
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:32,320
that architecture
 

1821
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,510
that architecture
are formed and we

1822
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:35,520
are formed and we
 

1823
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,230
are formed and we
it consists uh actually it is a

1824
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:38,240
it consists uh actually it is a
 

1825
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,030
it consists uh actually it is a
semi-open

1826
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,040

 

1827
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,349

group of people because

1828
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:43,359
group of people because
 

1829
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,630
group of people because
we

1830
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:44,640
we
 

1831
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,270
we
it's not it's nothing to hide

1832
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:47,280
it's not it's nothing to hide
 

1833
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,190
it's not it's nothing to hide
from us uh

1834
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:49,200
from us uh
 

1835
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,710
from us uh
actually all developing should be open

1836
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:50,720
actually all developing should be open
 

1837
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,990
actually all developing should be open
source and clear for all our members

1838
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,000

 

1839
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,829

of the community

1840
00:38:57,829 --> 00:38:57,839
of the community
 

1841
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,470
of the community
but of course if we invite everybody

1842
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:00,480
but of course if we invite everybody
 

1843
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,030
but of course if we invite everybody
from the street then we'll it will be

1844
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,040
from the street then we'll it will be
 

1845
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,790
from the street then we'll it will be
not possible to discuss quite complex

1846
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:04,800
not possible to discuss quite complex
 

1847
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,230
not possible to discuss quite complex
technical stuff

1848
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,240
technical stuff
 

1849
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,870
technical stuff
so that's why uh

1850
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:08,880
so that's why uh
 

1851
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,829
so that's why uh
that those meetings they are a little

1852
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:11,839
that those meetings they are a little
 

1853
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,030
that those meetings they are a little
bit limited

1854
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,040

 

1855
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,030

and participation they're

1856
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,040
and participation they're
 

1857
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,829
and participation they're
limited only to 2k members

1858
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:21,839

uh as solano mentioned before
 

1863
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,030
uh as solano mentioned before
now priorities which were set up

1864
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,040
now priorities which were set up
 

1865
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,310
now priorities which were set up
by the

1866

mechanism because if you

2120
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:42,400
mechanism because if you
 

2121
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,910
mechanism because if you
uh of course if you don't care about

2122
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:43,920
uh of course if you don't care about
 

2123
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,150
uh of course if you don't care about
your accounts then why we should care as

2124
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,160
your accounts then why we should care as
 

2125
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,510
your accounts then why we should care as
a blockchain where we should store it

2126
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:47,520
a blockchain where we should store it
 

2127
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,750
a blockchain where we should store it
forever for free and once that account

2128
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:51,760
forever for free and once that account
 

2129
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,950
forever for free and once that account
becomes frozen you have time to reverse

2130
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:54,960
becomes frozen you have time to reverse
 

2131
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,630
becomes frozen you have time to reverse
things and

2132
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:56,640
things and
 

2133
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,430
things and
come and

2134
00:44:59,430 --> 00:44:59,440

 

2135
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,430

upload back

2136
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:01,440
upload back
 

2137
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,870
upload back
your account

2138
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:02,880
your account
 

2139
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,710
your account
in a state

2140
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:04,720
in a state
 

2141
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,750
in a state
what uh it was before it was frozen

2142
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:07,760
what uh it was before it was frozen
 

2143
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,150
what uh it was before it was frozen
that's why uh hash is frozen to that

2144
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:10,160
that's why uh hash is frozen to that
 

2145
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,030
that's why uh hash is frozen to that
address uh that's why hash is stored

2146
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:13,040
address uh that's why hash is stored
 

2147
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,829
address uh that's why hash is stored
uh as a data for that address

2148
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:15,839
uh as a data for that address
 

2149
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:16,710
uh as a data for that address
so

2150
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:16,720
so
 

2151
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,470
so
from my personal view it is a great

2152
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:18,480
from my personal view it is a great
 

2153
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,150
from my personal view it is a great
mechanism

2154
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:20,160
mechanism
 

2155
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,390
mechanism
right well in

2156
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:22,400

2157
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,710
right well in
theory right it is but in practice you

2158
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:24,720
theory right it is but in practice you
 

2159
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,230
theory right it is but in practice you
remember uh

2160
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:26,240
remember uh
 

2161
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,430
remember uh
the amount of

2162
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:27,440
the amount of
 

2163
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,870
the amount of
pain we have

2164
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:28,880
pain we have
 

2165
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,030
pain we have
experienced by restoring one of the

right it can be restored now

2170
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:35,440
right it can be restored now
 

2171
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,950
right it can be restored now

2172
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:36,960

uh so um i don't know we'll see maybe

2638
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:45,359
uh so um i don't know we'll see maybe
 

2639
