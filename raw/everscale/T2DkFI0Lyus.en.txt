so go
hi all uh welcome to our ama session uh
today uh we are going to discuss uh the
very important topics
and today our guests are sergey shashf
co-founder of broxas and uh what is
often amarov
will tell us more about the
past
past and future updates
so sergey
okay guys so we will start
we set up updates and we immigrated from
t3 to keep free one
and
we
prepare this process during
four maybe five five months it was
crucial for our adoption in another
network
and for new users
unfortunately
we have some potential potential back in
depreciable and we solved it
and we understood that we
must stop migration before big big mass
adoption
uh because we all like like wall
we have worked with us during the last
two years
and we and you i think you don't know
what's what's spain
but new users
not ready not ready to
support different migrations
and which is why we did it and
we
didn't launch a lot of marketing
activities and partnership what they had
planned before
because they didn't create risks
whisper applied migration it was very
hard for us for boxes
because we spent
a lot of resource for it
without business radio
but it's necessary
it's necessary because for fit it's
impossible to
to going forward and
to to work with a big uh big adoption
uh so
uh uh i know that there are a lot of
questions in mhm session but we will
start from main questions
uh what
what uh broxas did with uh query and
relay
why we did it and what we can do in
network
uh
if you reviewed uh some another
blockchain for example ethereum and you
know how compound work how they work
how hdtv work and another
they all have
a lot of
some potential
potential potential potential problem
and we must verma solve it and we must
do
uh for example if some duty money from
uh dark
internet will will go will go for us and
you'll try go go from us and if some
user
will
deploy a smart contract uh and uh
move on with some content to black hole
uh all to another place uh he will he
lost it
and um
we are working in very
in very extreme environment
we are working in uh network what kind
of dates every day and we are planning
to
change
consensus
and
different improvements in protocol
it's a work of aviarix labs
and we have changing different
compilers
and
we have a lot of potential risks
and uh
and i have personal
responsibility for this risks
and
and we decided a lot of months ago
uh that
we will have different administrative
administrative tools
like at work in in the eye for example
in compound to its guard role
and uh and emergency mode and the
emergency meals and then guards in vitro
uh we can we can do
uh some different things and
for example we can burn token and we can
restore token in another place
but uh it's impossible to move this
token from for example from agriculture
to other networks
uh because our streams it's a different
people and they didn't know
about about
uh himself for example uh quartz in
ethereum arts in the area scale it's uh
independent people
and yeah they don't know each other
yeah and they know each other
and uh when we start migration uh we got
we got risk
because uh during migration dow can't
work
uh and and also now is very slow
uh for in our bridge now we can set up
one decision during seven days not less
and it's very optimistic
it's missing seven days uh in our
practice it's up to 10 14 days
and
because uh we can we can we have large
function uh guard function work
uh universe migration
and uh one of relay from korea
uh attack network it's not only about
selling tokens it's
about responsibility because all relays
had wasting
and also
during migration they have a
possibility to provide a wrong
transaction
and because network's not stable
we had possibility to attack our network
and trying to stall to store money
and i had no another nice choice my
choice
about about uh
uh
or cultural art and stupid decision
uh what uh
tao of bridge will do with its money in
future it will be our decision
we will provide our data
about this incident
and afraid thou will be able to stop and
decision and we like remember now of
course we will accept it
so about this
what what we can do in the emergency
node it's similar to collectors to
another network
for example in multi-chain and we have
near to
one billion liquidity now or eight
billion feet an
they can print money in another network
and they can build money
and uh we also have requests it's the
best best practice in in real world a
lot of people know about it
but it's for it's work like this
and um this is uh one one point and
another point
i said uh we have uh incident some
months ago and uh we get requests
about about one of our users
who move
money from from gettra
and
we must to provide data about about this
incident and show all direction how it's
worked
all bridges all the excess
are
doing similar things every day
but a lot of people don't know about it
but it's how it's not performed
well please please continue about uh
technical part of course yeah so uh
thank you sergey so and uh yeah actually
i want to add also that
um
we in our work in our uh
architecture so we
used the best practices that uh are used
in the
not only crypto world with with the
major protocols so uh but also
uh it's a traditional finance world so
there are common practices on how you
operate uh and how you make decisions
concerning
the
incidents so there are special protocols
for such incidents
and there are special roles uh nest
sergey said they named guardians and
typically
geographically
distributed uh to avoid attack a
possible attack at all the people
and typically there are uh
several teams of guardians who
don't know each other to to
really
mitigate the risk of
some cooperation between them so and all
of this
was implemented in in the british
protocol and as of now so we strongly
believe that it is one of the most
secure uh solutions in the market and uh
we strongly uh stick to this
uh so now uh let's let's get to the to
the migration that's how how it works so
and spencer gay said that we had four to
five months to prepare it it's it's not
a joke it's totally a really
difficult work that we started
uh at early october and a trunk and
even although the standard itself was
not yet approved
at that moment but
uh the just to describe the sequence of
uh
things that needs to be done to upgrade
such such solution such complex solution
at the bridge
so uh it took quite a long period of
time and that's only why why we were
able to perform the migration of all of
our tools
over a short period of time we
almost precisely uh met the deadline so
uh
there were a few few things
just uh that could happen so but uh
the major migration so was done on time
and only some interfaces were just
rolling out on sixteenths
um so what actually uh
was done uh is that uh the technical
team of broadcast has uh redeployed the
whole set of of smart contracts and each
redeployment for you just to understand
is uh
dozens of signatures of different
multi-signature wallets that are used in
the emergency mode and all the
coordination with relayers and update of
relayer nodes and uh also
update of all the interfaces wallets uh
uh preparation of different instructions
and manuals for for people and
communication part
so although uh i see that uh even even
today this was not uh enough we did our
best to
uh keep all the users informed what what
is going on and
answering the questions and the support
was
really doing the job 24 7
to answer all potential questions
still there are some some questions
horizons
in such course of difficult uh such a
difficult migration it's
uh
it's typical that people don't
understand the whole scope and start
asking questions when when when so but
yeah
actually
everything is done on time so and i'm
really
grateful for those users who were
patient and uh really supported us over
this migration this was the most biggest
the biggest migration we ever did so and
that was a tremendous work that uh
we
have done
uh
so um i propose maybe let's let's move
to questions from so uh i see that there
is a number of them
before questions i want to
uh to describe something about
about korean tiger about korean problem
uh
yeah in korea
it's not it's not one country and it's
not one man
it's a different group of people
and uh we have one group of what
like every scale and uh
available tokens and we move it to
to the total blocks of the pools
and
they
provide a lot of possibility and both
and they create a lot of effort for us
in korea and in japan too
and
we have
one another another another team
and
we stim had the control on the
under
luji tokens and and uh it was uh like
how to say it
like like one kind of fraud
and uh we have decision how to solve it
uh we start to do it we start doing it
from
units of attack and also
some governance keys in every scale i
change
and
also we are planning to run
to run
some mechanics some mechanics for lugia
uh because uh because we need to
to protect network from um
from from enemies
so of its remark i think we need to
start our
yeah this was a cool article about the
fraud protection yeah
um so let's move on to the
questions from our community
uh the first question uh is um
why octus why flat cube
um
that's a few comments about this uh so
first of all uh
after the abandon of the network itself
so it became obvious that we can no
longer
uh live with uh the word tone in the
name in our product because it was uh
bearing a lot of reputational risks and
a lot of confusions uh appear from that
uh so we had a choice
and really a very long-lasting
discussion about where we would like to
go with our branding either we would
like to continue um
keeping all the products under the one
umbrella brands so beans brochures or
something else whatever scale whatever
or we would like those products to to
live their own life and have their own
roadmap and potentially become a
separate companies
with their own future and investors and
whatever
and um in the end of uh january we had
the strategy session that you have seen
some artifacts from it in our medium
where we decided to
first of all uh have uh uh
own dao on the on our decks so meaning
that it will have its own token its
own token holders its own
governance members
and also we decided that uh both bridge
and dex should have the the own unique
names
um
after that there was quite quite a
several number of uh brainstorms
on on how to name them and uh
the main challenge was that we wanted
the products to be named uh simple
from one side and
easy to remember
and on the other hand to have them um
protected in terms of the trademarks
potential accusations on the usage of
trademarks of someone
uh so after we have selected the short
list of names so we started to do the
trademark search and analyzing so
which domain names are free and uh which
names are used in the
in our industry because our industry
surprisingly became one of the
biggest consumer of good names
and a lot of names were that we invented
were already occupied so some
several dozens of them
so finally uh
we have selected several uh names and
shortlists both for decks and for the
bridge
and uh
finally we decided to name
the bridge doctors
because it is an entity staying in
between of different networks connecting
them all together like an octopus has
several hands but on the other
hand octopuses
are one of the smartest animals
on the earth and if you just
look at the other research so they are
considered the third
smartest animal after
a human and dolphin
in the world
so and having the octus
um as a name so it's as simple to
pronounce easy to remember and noctus
bridge uh really resembles
uh
how
the bridge is perceived
uh flat cube is a bit
more different story so uh and um
we always imagined uh having our decks
not just uh as a simple replica of
unisport or some some other index from
from evm world
but rather we wanted to to have it like
um
hub for different uh different
activities that the hub that can have
many faces it can uh this use
used for several different purposes for
launch pads for
other case cases so it's like pretty
much like hypercube that's
the technology that we used to have uh
never scale but no longer
uh but uh this is a cube with
many many faces
and uh but on the other hand uh this is
something that can be
uh
sticks really simply so this is
something as simple as a square so like
flat cube
is a square
is one of them one of the
most famous figures and primitives and
uh it is uh very simple and easy to
understand
so uh and this is actually our creditor
so we try to do our
complex really complex products as
simple as possible uh up to the level
uh that even a non-educated user can
easily understand how to use it
so yeah we decided that flat cube is a
good name also it is rhythmical
technically sounding and easy to
remember
and the token as you
everyone may have noticed it is named
cube
so
it will have its own icon so it's it's
under developments probably we will have
some temporary icons just to have it on
the
interface but uh all of our products
will receive the as a unique identity
soon
as we used to have
to say another scale
but we want them to be really
recognizable and easy to remember
so i hope you really hope that you like
the new names
i've got the
[Music]
private message uh is there a trademark
are you registered
trademark
yeah it's it's in progress now
okay okay and there are one more comment
on youtube that uh octopus is pretty
strong branding uh if done right
uh it's all in
in one and elsa beaten off rock and roll
thank you thank you
yeah
uh the next question is um
when ledger integration uh because uh if
i'm not mistaken there was a post from
sergei pateken
in twitter that
uh he said he made the screenshot yeah
the ledger integration can you tell us
more about it yeah i will describe about
treasure uh we had the solution for
leisure integration in may
of last year
yeah a lot of months ago
and um
but pleasure had a very big query of
different projects who
who wants to launch solution
and
if you in ethereum network and um it's
easier
if you're not ethereum you have two ways
one way is uh
wait some time and second way is bring
out money
uh because the young network without
without investments
uh
we
we await
and we we spent some months when we're
waiting but
now it's really in progress
because we're working with our github
and
we update
a lot of things
because they do change different
standards and
when we finish ui
i hope
in
one month we will we will publish it and
legend will support us
because we started in may of last year
it was a lot of months ago
yeah and also uh
recently we also updated the
ledger application to support
the tokens of new standard
so currently it is in review and you can
already by the way try the ledger
application by yourself by
going to a ledger live application and
switching it into the developer modes so
there you will find since they have a
scale
but uh so we are still uh as sergey said
so they are expecting from us some
interfaces to test the ledger
application
and uh
we have the integration with
ledger sdk at the level of our wallet
score megaton that you may find our
github as well
uh so for for many many months and
several several times already managed to
update it so now the turn is for
interface team so uh once we finalize
all the stuff linked with the migration
of
our products so there's still some minor
things to be done
so we will update the wallet uh
correspondingly and provided
for testing to a larger team so and once
they have it so they will perform the
internal security audit so hopefully it
will not take that much time because now
we
managed to significantly improve the
speed of communication with them so now
we have a dedicated manager who
is answering quite sweetly well not the
best but uh still uh so we deserve huge
progress
and hopefully uh shortly we will see
the full support of ledger in uh the
july
i mean the scaling ledger map
yeah that's amazing news that uh
communities waited so long time yeah
cool great job
uh
next question uh is about the contests
uh all contests are already stopped
uh is there any plan uh on how giver
tokens will be distributed in the future
uh sure yeah yeah about planes um
looking for plan uh for
continue different reforms as they
started from the far east
and uh
the first state is a totally solve of
korean problem
uh the second stage
is a
reform for partnerships
because
a lot of our partnerships
were under investigation
and
i think
90 percent plus of partnership will be
closed totally
another partnership will get settlement
for example with last range
or maybe some condition would maybe what
they will should
should to solve before or before last
range
and uh
now i am
and uh another another members of
allianz and labs in negotiations
we have partnerships
and uh well fair consensus we will
provide it to public information
it's about partnerships about about
sub-governance
it's also
uh to be in information
um we are trying now to
convert some governance to a service
model
uh for example for modification
it's very um
uh we're working on the total amazing
job uh because
we need uh a good audit in our system
and formalification
and
it's a necessary service for projects
who want to launch in our no no no
network
and uh where you can work like a service
uh right here they can get money from
giver
and uh provide services for different
projects and uh some some governments
will be able to transform to this model
uh some some sort of governance should
transfer to dow model and uh to work but
one way
main point
they all should have
uh
some some kind of business
uh who will work with governance because
because without business it's uh
it's work uh not
uh like like we estimated
uh and a loss of government should be
closed
uh because they didn't bring any value
for network
and uh
and i think it will be about balance in
march
before partnerships because some
partnerships uh have a lot of potential
obligations for network
and defeats to governance and i think up
to end of the end of march uh all if all
reforms will be done
and uh faith it will be transparency
network for fall
and uh about about warfare community and
totally agree
that
people from community should to
should bring somebody for network and
get some kind of rewards and it's for
now for example there is an amazing
channel with different mems about about
their scale i have running it always
and uh it's like contest and that's work
and if if you will compare each
activity
we are spend
maybe some thousands of favors
first
first mems contest
spend
near to
two hundred thousand of my favorites
maybe more
and if you compare this model as a
model how it works like this it's a
crucial more efficiency
thank you thank you sergey for letting
us know about the giver uh tokens reform
uh there's uh additional question um
why did you make a blockchain explorer
for tonkwein
oh it's very it's very interesting
question
i answered
tweets in private oldest times
first of all
this network have no good
good experience transparency
transparency
and we bring transparency for this
network because a lot of people can't
understand
where tokens are now
how we
moved from one address to another
address of water exchange countries and
etc
and
because we want to bring transparency
and some dependent people
who will
uh who will use it for different purpose
uh we
develop we develop this explorer
it's first reason and
another reason
all links from those forums
are moving to our products
and for us it's
free advertising
all
cool cool
yeah
um
next question when binance when other
exchanges what the current status
about does the exchanges
the fallians are working on it and
[Music]
i think we will have several listings in
in march and april
about about finance it's
it's it's like it's like from one point
of point of view it's up on the mountain
uh because binding sets uh number one in
in users and individual
but from another
point the scale is not about not about
shilling
and it's not about how to develop any
 and uh corrupt binance and listing
and uh corrupt binance and listing
and get this in combinance
and sell to different hamsters his
tokens in the
it's not okay guys
of course of course
sooner or later
we will be on violence
but
not in one month
it's on day after another exchange
and
yeah full support
um
next question uh about the situation
around the
crystal hands program funds
their updates
i thought about it on my last time i say
session but it was in russian
so particularly we we get we get money
from funds to pistol hands
it was up to end of december
uh in january all crypto market
was still
in down
and uh only when it grows when markets
are growing up
uh funds return to us and uh it's uh
it's negotiation uh we had potential
this investor stall
and
when this investors will commit around
half eight it will be
very quickly
a lot of people are working on their
desk
thanks thanks yeah please stay keep
don't yeah
uh
the next question uh what
uh uh are you planning to add ever uh
in wallets like exodus
uh because we're already
almost integrated in ledger maybe there
are exodus or other wallets
it's it's a matter of partnership
different partnership and expansion uh
two different wallets and
actually this is the part of the work of
the defy lines and
the sales agents and business
development hunters
who are scouting the market and daily
talking
to different wallets different payment
solutions different products
uh convincing them to at least
ever scale into those networks uh
moreover so um
we have developed this as you may know
the api which is named just ever wallet
api so uh to facilitate the listing and
add the support and support to any kind
of solution
and this really helps a lot and
i hope that
we will see a lot of good names
appearing but
uh
for instance we already have several big
wallets who have integrated
like free wallets like
cracterium or some other wallets and of
course this work will continue
thank you
next question uh when new partnerships
which kind of partnerships
any any of them
i think i think partnership is an old
model uh because it uh
we're trying to do it and unfortunately
it didn't work
and um continue will be in the grants
program
uh now it's from franklin's and second
stage is from
foundation
it's like works in another network
uh the
question are are we already partnered
with cardana can we do the same with
near and polygon
i think same same with polygon in
scenario i don't know how how to
how to achieve it quickly
but i know how to
uh how to do it with cardana in texas
because kadana and tesla's now had
a lot of problems with blockchain and
they are looking for different
potential air to solution but we'll be
able
delivery
different tools for ecosystem
and
in gardana i worked under it
and they started from six
maybe four months ago
and uh we created uh one bridge and uh
second bridge will be our partner and
the federal bridge will be only one way
how to move
and uh
we and it will uh bring a lot of
liquidity and users for us
amazing
and its main reason for our update from
uh t32 to tip 3.1
yeah we need more liquidity providers
cool
when initial members provide a report
as we remember new initial members will
receive 1 million tokens
i i can't answer to this question
because we didn't discuss it with other
initial members and in our global sub
governance community
but i think with it this will you'll be
proposed from from every slaps
about it and uh for continue wasting all
initial members
will uh
will provide
will provide reports what we did uh if
we will not provide it i think we will
not uh
get twisting
yeah cool decision cool decision
it's it's it's not it's not decision
it's my personal opinion
yeah but i think that community will
support it for them as me
uh
what will happen
failed
partnerships can they start to return
funds to the giver or
do you believe this
yes
i think i think uh bad partnership uh
sold eithers
and they have no errors and of course we
will not uh return money together
it's only in you now
in our dreams
yes also no legal obligation from the
side because in the this
partnership model that was used in the
scale of return back there
so
neither of uh other partners signed any
legally binding papers
obliging them to to perform
and this is one of the reasons why this
model didn't work and
there was no best thing there were no no
things like um
locking uh for
the
partnership
fee so for a certain period of time so
and
unless you control the money or you have
legally buying documents so it's just
well almost impossible to
to get something back so
i personally don't believe that we will
get
yeah that's it
um next question uh
what uh is there a grand program road
map uh what will happen after the
15 million stocking distribution
um
maybe uh first i i would like to make a
few comments about what's going on with
the grants program itself so we managed
to to build a really strong team now who
is researching the projects uh daily so
they have they have several calls per
day with different projects and
they
really carefully analyze them and
perform due diligence of these projects
and
several of them that were of course
focused on the other scales i have
received the sa grants
at the beginning but there are several
new ones that that are coming so and you
will hear the name soon that are real
really nice and uh
the lights believe that they will bring
a lot of value to the network
uh
but
i would like to remind that this stage
of the grants program
is the initial stage and it's uh this
this is a stage for experiments so
because we do not yet uh know which kind
of projects will bring the most value to
the network and
although we already have quite a good
stream of such projects that are
coming
into the funnel um
we would like to scale it much much
wider
and uh but to understand better uh which
projects
we need and how to approach them how to
motivate them to participate in this
grant program
uh so we need to get some experience so
and we are getting it now and uh
i think that's in a few months so uh
after at least a dozen of projects are
approved and 100 is filtered
so we will be able to make some
conclusions and
significantly
establish a significantly solid
uh process of grasping
but until then so it is really difficult
to speak about roadmap i would like also
to remind that have a scale still a
young network and
this project so we need these projects
more than they need us
and this is a really pragmatic approach
that we can stand and
we need
to start being uh
attractable attractive in ice for bigger
projects and
getting the first
[Music]
stage implemented
successfully is crucial for this because
after that so we will be able to scale
it up and bring some uh some much much
bigger and major
protocols to our network
i hope that's by the way we will uh
manage to have an mma session with the
grand grants team
maybe next month so uh
they will explain in details what they
are doing and
which kind of projects they are
negotiating
yeah
as as rome said baby steps yeah i think
it's a great idea uh create a my session
program for a team of grants onboarding
because we have nearly 27 people
uh in this group and uh
for
for two people it's full time
for
five people it's uh partial time
and it's really strong process and and i
think we're ready to
to do it public
explain how it's worked
yeah it will be
amazing for the community to letting
know uh what's
going on with
grant receivers yeah
uh so let's move to the youtube
questions um there is a question from
constantine
uh can custom tip 3.1 token
not from the white list be added to
external
cx exchanges uh will there be any guide
guidelines instructions or documentation
to better understand this process
um
okay what because
yeah so actually this is one of the
points we are working on in the defy
lines
really strongly because it's uh
for us it's important not only to to
have uh ever
on sexes
but also to ensure that those
centralized exchanges integrated the
scale natively
with the full support of
not only the native currency but also
for
uh for tokens of the projects
uh
of course
after that there will be the gate will
be opened uh not the gate io i mean but
the gate for for a new project so to
approach exchanges and uh negotiate with
them and propose and teach the project
to be listed and so on so forth
but uh what we are doing now so we're
trying to at least ensure that it is
possible
so and uh together with the main listing
gets the possibility
for
for native tokens also will appear there
uh yes and uh
about about uh g51 listing in success
we we started this process about uh two
weeks ago
and uh we will provide special software
and uh we have some aliasing exchanges
for it
and uh we will start it from a bridge
maybe grand bazaar tokens maybe some
other tokens
and we spray
will be free from
for four tickets
because we are first
in in in this way
but uh when we will provide some
successful cases
it will possible for all for working our
system
uh there are additional question uh is
there uh
will brokers to be able provide the
technical support or if necessary
yeah that's actually what we're doing so
we uh
help them exchanges to integrate uh
especially with our wallet api
that already has the support for such
tokens and they can be easily added just
like
erc20
announces the process of your statement
listing is mostly due diligence and not
technical stuff because you can easily
add any erc20 token technically on any
exchange but
the major times taken to agree on the
listing terms on the due diligence part
and so on so forth but
nobody cares about the technical side
and we want to to achieve the same level
of
easiness on uh technical addition of new
tokens to texas
um next question was from ever how can i
purchase cube token uh i provided that
you can buy it on decks
and yeah
maybe you will be an airdrop or
something like that in the near future
about taking cube
yeah yeah
yeah no
um have another idea
it's um it's not about about their drops
uh it's not it's not you should not work
well like bridge it will be in
summoner's economy
uh
we didn't
launch this token
and
we didn't bring it published but
we got a lot of
people who want to buy on private
and
but we will launch it on their own
on
launchpad um launchpad will go in in two
weeks
uh because we have wait for tprivan
tokens too
and um coupe will not be first project
in launchpad it will be one create
deposit protocol
and coop will be number two maybe one
two three on launchpad and we will be
able for all
and we will change farming
uh we will not farm either uh we will we
will start farming cube token
cube token will get uh best practice
from uh
chain network uh like uh pancake sushi
uh
and uh and etc
and uh it will be only only one way how
to get it and how how to use it because
we
provided a big
big power for this locking
and
i think all the projects will want to
help it we
want to use it
and
and well and uh also
uh we will provide
some a gift for our community
we will launch
community tokens like soon
in uh flat tube next week
because uh guys you was we were with us
during during court of months
and it gives us
for you
cool cool
no we'll be waiting
i i would like also to add that uh once
uh the tokenomics of the cube talking is
ready
to publish so we will share it for sure
and uh
so now this is just easier
so
just
you can uh for now try to guess what
will be in the tokenomics documents for
for the keep talking and
uh i i i can just uh give a price to the
ones who
will guess the most precisely how it
work and which features uh will appear
there so the one who will
just guess the more precisely uh what
will be in the tokenics and how it will
work so and i will get 1000 levels from
me
so
just a small small game
big big
prize
just be creative
yeah
uh
there are one more question uh does it
mean ledger will became a validator at
everscale network or it won't support
sticking for now
uh there was no discussions for the
newsletter uh about this
so for now we need to ensure the
technical integration of uh our currency
and tokens
it's a letter software because we really
need it and
we get a lot of requests from
institutional investors
to have it but uh
yes we
plan to approach the major market
players and becoming
validators and maybe sometimes layers in
the bridge so uh
just to add the
attention to the network and
get the better backers for
for the whole network for the project
so
but for now
there was no direct discussion
yeah
[Music]
um
the next question uh
hi uh
are any game five projects is going to
launch on everscale network
ever corrupt
[Laughter]
i'm just kidding uh actually
i know that
there was a game developed by the
chinese community named have a lot
so i do not actually know about the
status of this game so how is going on
so maybe they will
share some updates about this
and
also
i have seen several projects in the
pipeline of the grants team
so maybe
at least one or several of them will
manage
to to go through the funnel and get the
ground so it was a good of us
uh but also uh
on each conference you know in each
meetup so we are talking uh to different
uh gamify metaverse
uh projects uh and uh explain the
benefits of the skill for sure so
maybe one of those projects will appear
here but no
straight commitments yet
uh
when will give a reform from media gold
to voting by government governance
yeah i don't know too about about
reforms uh
i can't uh
set up a decision about it and uh if
there is constant decision and
never
can start decisions
how to do it
and believe me now it's
it's not
it's hard it's always hard discussion
because um if you will uh return uh to
one year or more to our past
it uh it will not have discussion how to
how to stop decision about providing
tokens given teacher
now now it's it's all discussion
yeah
and when you think uh
what do you think that it will be
accepted or not just to fully answer it
from
his question
sorry roman i don't i don't really
understand
uh yeah uh
your opinion uh do you think that
this reform
are good or not
that's
a problem
let's wait for me to publish it and then
we will discuss it because but i
i did i didn't see draft about about
reform and description of it
okay
okay so um there's no more questions we
already answered on all questions on
youtube
uh
on this note i can say just uh thanks
