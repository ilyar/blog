hello everyone
hi
hi guys
hello hello
okay so traditionally let's wait for one
more minute and let's start
okay
i think we can start
so hello everyone
welcome to our 40th weekly device of
governance
call
so it's 40 weeks that we are
running this this calls
uh without any any misses i find it
wrong
so and that's that's a good good
stability i would call it like this
so we have
some agenda for today so and
i will start from contest updates
uh actually
uh as discussed last time uh we will
prolong the distributed validator oracle
contest uh until the end of august
because no submissions were applied and
uh at least with such prolongation so we
have at least two contestants that
promised to join the contest so that's
good and hopefully
uh we will find someone else
uh
also of uh there are 18 days left and
here for submission to st town
implementation contest uh there's only
one on review
and also 19 days left for the new
selection of freeton defy jury
so uh if you have some
good candidates for the jury so please
please submit so if you want you can do
this yourself as well
uh
and also uh 50 days left until the
implementation
end of the implementation stages three
and four for the steering bridge
i have created the the prolongation
proposal uh just few a few moments ago
and uh
if there are some uh
governance members so please please go
to the proposal interface and
vote for it
we needed to be approved and for some
reason i see that the procedural remarks
on contest version 2 has not passed last
time
although i was sure that we collected
enough votes so i will just make some
investigation and
let's discuss what was wrong so if
simply someone didn't have time or
there was some reason for not voting
uh all right so that's it for updates uh
now about uh good news so we have done
two payouts uh payout for two contests
actually it was a
uh deck stage two uh contests and also
the
uh free thrones of sovereign identity
framework stage stage one
so congrats to winners and all the
rewards uh on your wallet
already next
news is about the crystal wallet that is
used uh on the constellation of process
defy products uh so you may have seen
this big announcement so the
wallet was uh dramatically improved so
now it supports multi seats multi
accounts multi keys multi signatures and
uh
multi networks so actually there is a
multi update
so if you didn't try it yet so please
enjoy so we know about some minor bugs
and in it already thanks to the early
early users
and if you find something else so please
do not hesitate to
pin me and
tell what you found so
we will improve it definitely the next
version
uh
next news is about the governments to
tokens
so i will be preparing the proposal for
the active members uh who
would will get these tokens to
vote
in the governors to o
interface so you may have seen such news
from different sub governances coming
from here there
so yeah
i will just publish it soon
uh
next news is about the new giver address
as
uh numerous
has
left the defy sub governance so we
finally mind the appropriate address for
the defy giver and it will start with d5
actually so
it's just a fun fact uh so hopefully we
will be able to
migrate all the funds to a new giver and
with a new
set of custodians
because uh in past it was really really
challenging to collect five out of seven
custodians uh especially keep in mind
that one of them has left us
so um
so do not be afraid that there will be
one big chunk of money moving from the
defy giver to a new address so i will
post the new one
later here
as soon as we test it that all the
custodians have access and uh
all the keys are working so just the
final checks
um
all right so that's about news uh now
sergey
here
no he's not here yet
just let helping him
uh he wanted to tell
about the crystal handshake program
meanwhile i'm pinging him so alex yes
you wanted to ask something
what uh sorry i missed what is the
reason for a new giver
uh in in the past giver there were seven
concussed audience uh
one of them was uh who was included in
the
first set of uh
governance members and this the
signature scheme uh was five out of
seven signatures
uh that's required uh
to collect at least five people uh as
nimrod has left us so uh first of all
it's not secure to keep the person who
is not in charge of certain sub
governance anymore
and uh we have deployed a new one uh
with six
remaining governance members
and uh change the signature scheme to
four out of six so just to speed up all
the payouts to uh
to winners of contests
ah so in short the reason is the initial
member list
we announced about this a long time ago
but uh
finally we managed to to
get it done
simply so
too many things will be done okay sergey
is with us uh today so a gay uh okay
yeah alina you have some some questions
yeah i have a question about one of news
uh can you please tell more about go
about go
into zero tokens because before that we
only heard about golf tokens from uh
dance system i guess meets us yeah
it's
actually uh pretty much uh same same
thing uh as far as i understand so
unfortunately meteor is not with us okay
i am here yeah are you here oh maybe you
can you can just explain
it's it will start from dance it's a
dance like
governance talkers that can be used in
smb voting and the the smv voting will
be for dance first as an as a as a first
like test experiment and so on
but um but this talking like
maybe extent its users may be extended
to other you know in in near future to
other
um voting
proposals for stuff like that so we're
gradually
like starting to
uh to roll out the governance
uh the bftg the governance to zero
system and that's the first kind of
application so
i don't think we will deploy like
hundreds of things covered in tokens i
think that they will just add usage to
these months
yeah pretty much logically right
paddle please
yes i
talked with rahman
meter as you proposed
uh they were unaware that they should do
the deployment but they promised to
create an instruction by like on monday
uh
and yes but key is enough
due to reasons i explained
before on the vex call uh so
um
now i mean just waiting for for
collecting all approved
uh list of pakis uh from sub governments
and hopefully next week the process will
start
because uh
jenny mccarroll is on vacation so
probably we'll be able to do it next
week
okay okay so
actually uh there will be not only uh
sub governance members uh or custodians
uh called letter z wish but also we will
include and uh propose to include
some of you um has been uh active
members of this sub governance to
receive these tokens as well so
uh i'm just now collecting the shortlist
of those who will be proposed from our
site
okay so uh now sergey please uh tell us
a bit more about crystal handshake
program
because some people already have seen
some years of it
yeah yeah about this program uh we are
starting first pull with this program
now
uh it will be
one of a nifty project in ethereum
ecosystem
and
also
away in group
blockchain pro
it's one of the groups who are working
with the file yarns and
support our different pr activity
so about this program of why we launch
it and how it will be work
uh inferior mecha system there are a lot
of different projects uh it's thousands
and thousand projects who are trying to
[Music]
attract liquidity in freedom
and because uh very
biggest competition between between this
project
uh where they're moving to polygon to
bnb uh two new year and to another
project
uh now with return there are no any
project uh who attract defeated in
fliton
and
and we will start work with projects
with who have some somehow hard hard
criteria
first criteria it should be project who
cover first round
and
first round should be on the with lock
up and wasting period
the second condition it should be
project without any free flow at the
market
so it on swap will be first
exchange for it project
and
the third condition uh projects uh
must supply
uh
liquidity in their token for pool
and uh supply liquidity for farming uh
and maybe of some project three five we
will change condition uh we have a lot
of projects within this negotiation now
and we'll watch how it will work
for their project it's interesting
because
they want to start to work with return
community
and
for us it's interesting because our
community will will get
potential opportunity vs different
tokens and earn money or lose money of
course is its market
yeah in their tokens and
it will be involve a new new project and
new community to our system
and of course
when this project will involve to
photonic system we will start work with
our ecosystem
uh for example
its first project
will
launch different mft in in return
and nifty bridge with us
and we in this in these conditions in
return we have no risks
in liquidity because we are working only
with project without without free flow
okay
i actually uh um posted the uh more
detailed description of the program uh
on the device
uh so please
just look through through the article
some of you may be already seen this
before
uh so this is actually needed to to
boost the number of uh good projects and
uh what sergey didn't say is actually
that uh all such projects will be really
tightly uh
through uh through the
compliance parts through the due
diligence part uh
by the defile lines and uh only the best
of the best will will be able to
participate in this program and the
number of uh places is limited so
actually for the coming two months there
are only five places one of which is
already occupied
uh
so
if you know such projects you have good
contacts with the
founders so please please
send them the link and
they can
should contact us and
propose the project
yes ivan please
yeah
sergey you talked about breach and
vibration will be two two-sided breacher
will be like returned to uh to outside
bridge or
uh what is it what kind of what
capabilities of the bridge
of course of course breaches
to site
yeah that's nice
uh and but
unfortunately in uh in in in nfts there
are a lot of different standards
and um
and it will work with uh standard of
sale company that
and uh
i think maybe it will not work with a
different standard now in the same place
but i think it's it's normal situation
step by step we will go to
unique standards
for some time
what do you think about the true trinity
like brighton labs released
a few days ago
i i i
i don't i don't uh learn this standard i
i work before no not only nft my my word
is defy
okay
oh yeah by the way
by the way uh i i recently like brought
you about bitcoin stuff and i added yes
yes let's let's go let's let's start to
chat with them today
okay
because bitcoin is very interesting
project
which one
bitcoin
git coin i mean okay yeah
yeah cool guys
all right so let's move on uh
so uh guys from dev team uh kindly
prepared the draft for the third stage
of the free tone decks
implementation contest so uh alina maybe
you can just say for words about this
uh yes sure uh as we discussed before
on the previous weekly call we prepared
a document which states
the terms for final third stage of
implementation of the decks and we
tagged
uh all the
participants from previous
previous stage
i again uh tag the post so everybody can
check it out again who didn't see it
yeah um there are some
organizational moments like usual
and there are
parts like general requirements um what
must include application
and criteria uh evaluation and hard and
soft criteria uh and also artifacts
there are
it looks like a lot of information but
we try to be more specific
uh and we also try to use some phrases
to
make it uh possible to
meet the criteria for any kind of
architecture
so yeah i will be
happy if
everybody can enjoy the document and we
can put it for walking very soon like
this week before the next weekly call
yeah i tell everybody again i don't see
the point to read the whole document and
waste everybody's time
absolutely absolutely so everyone can
open the google doc and
have a look on their own
yeah
just just to make it more noticeable
here on the car absolutely absolutely i
will just pin it
does it exist in the forum
not yet because uh
we have not that many participants and
do not uh
like uh
to make it more clear to publish on on
the forum but it's not a problem we can
put it it doesn't take much time
yeah please put it into the forum just
as a good way to discuss it
okay
okay very good
yeah and zoro please
hello everyone uh so do we discuss some
minor detail or well major details from
there now uh do we have like like a few
minutes to uh
yeah we can um but i i doubt that
everyone has already uh
deeply uh learned it and uh maybe
it's worse to
draw attention to this and uh discuss in
details next time so as you wish up to
you
yeah just some some minor things and
well
i actually expected
people to have already seen it so yeah
maybe
i'll explain it it's not really some
complicated stuff so um there's the um
general requirement uh
about the yield farming
uh so it says like this uh the contracts
and methods for maintaining like so a
general requirement for for the tax
solution contracts and methods for many
maintaining liquidity and users
uh which includes yield farming
remuneration market making and other
ways of maintaining
so
um yeah i was thinking uh
is this uh
should this be a general requirement for
for the future future products uh like
taxes uh um
um well since
uh
well you guys
have um yield farming already in your
product in process exchange and i
believe it's open source so is there
any sense to develop this stuff if if
there's already a solution like that or
maybe it's easier to include the open
source uh
if it's needed in double taxes later on
maybe it should be included
uh
maybe
well
converted from
that's clear yeah yeah
should it be there or what do you guys
think
alina maybe you
uh yeah uh
we just probably would
i cannot tell you like right now because
we were looking at our own project first
and
we were thinking we had like purpose of
uh
finalizing project and make it like uh
working by itself in the future and be
able to work effectively so yeah we
added yield farming but
we can think uh about this uh question
and uh we of course we can discuss it
and
[Music]
take into account different uh
small things which can be
we can still take time uh to implement
uh open source code into our project
or maybe somebody else has also opinion
on that
yeah i just think that um it will be
something like
including
an already
complete part like i don't know
like developing a governance mechanism
that is already developed in freetown
ecosystem so uh why
why would we
um want to
expand
all the teams time on on development
something that is already working in
other
solutions freedom interior ecosystem i'm
not sure if if brox's
yield farming stuff is
open source i'm pretty sure yes it is
yeah well since it's open source i
thought that maybe it's like
not very uh
maybe
we cannot we cannot tell from scratch if
it's compatible with the with our system
but we we have to check that thank you
okay yeah another thing uh is um i've
noticed in some parts of it i'm not sure
if the proposal will be included in both
uh language variants in the
like on the forum and in the
to the voting but there's some parts in
there that i've noticed maybe are
not very good translation but uh there
was um
a part about making the most out of fees
and uh
um
most of the commissions and storage fees
yeah yeah i believe what it meant
what it was meant to be uh is making
effective uh use of the
of the uh
well fees collection mechanism and stuff
like that so maybe double check that
translation because it's not clear
by now document is open for comments so
you can leave the comments uh in any
part of it and this is why we wanted to
put it in the
chat before put it on the forum uh yeah
but we'll do it today anyway
okay
okay yeah and um well last but but not
least i wanted to ask everyone if if
if you guys think that uh
the current um
system for
evaluation
is
is fine i mean that it's not formal or
that it's not like
standardized because we have uh
in in both the previous uh contests and
in this one we have
hard criteria and soft criteria which
could be probably easily translated into
it sort of like a standardized system to
to
maybe
help judges
[Music]
to to help judges have a standardized
to
objectively
judge every solution and to have like a
set of scores that can be then
translated into
a single score that we have in the
governance right now so
what do you guys think if
should should we
think about
um well
maybe standardizing the
the evaluation process or is it okay as
it is right now
good idea
to be honest sorry sorry for this
please
yeah i just uh communicate with some
other uh some other
sub governance and yeah some of them
they really do have already have this
thing and they
put scores according to each criteria
for example uh minimum and maximum and
they put some score and they still uh
leave some points for
um
personal sub subjective points from
jurors
yeah i don't know i i just didn't feel
any problems with the
scores we have now but if jurors have
some troubles with the valuation
probably yes i don't think it's a
problem for us
i
yeah alexey i think had some more
comments on that
yeah it's a good idea because it's
it's one of the
way to
make more clear
assessments of the
different submissions and it will be
it will give a more
like understanding for participants
while they get such
marks and
make whole process more clear and
transparent
so i completely support this
uh it's
on one side it's it's a good approach uh
actually to make kind of uh recommended
assessment framework yeah so what what
jurors should look like which should
look at
when checking the solution
but on the other side uh i don't think
that including this in the contest
criteria is is a good idea actually
because
uh
in this way you can you are removing the
um
how to put it
the
not subjective uh i mean that
some judges uh can use their own
criteria system to assess this or that
work uh and uh
if they can explain uh why they uh
put this mark
so uh what's the reason to impose uh
some some different system to them
because uh this was in the very heart of
return actually to to let judges
their own decision
uh make their own decision and of course
we can recommend but we cannot
of insist we can insist and we shouldn't
use because uh
no no no remember it is just a function
it's a function when we get the entrance
for a
contest description and submission and
the result of this function is the mark
or what you call this exactly and this
function should be
repeatable and should be
reproducible so
alex
we talked with you about this uh several
times already so let's just stop it here
uh so
people no no no
no no no alex people are not robots
and everyone has their own
grounds and has their own set of
criteria so
we
have people alex sorry sorry let me
interrupt you so uh we have jury with
different uh
competencies and uh skills so we have
good economists among us and we have
good programmers among us and uh they
judge from their standpoint
so programmers judge from the technical
standpoint and economists judge from the
financial flossing points and the user
convenience and so on and so forth
you can recommend
alex sorry you can recommend certain
approaches but yeah it's always up to
jurors uh
to decide on the final score so and you
cannot uh prohibit this or insist uh
this is that approach as ultimately uh
and truth
truth one
so uh
otherwise we will get uh
all this uh [\h__\h] that is happening in in
some mems up governance and in uh with
all these gift cards so uh
and so forth i can remember several
contests when they tried to impose such
system and in the end it just masked the
inefficiency of jurors so uh and just
served for the
uh
specific submissions
so uh i won't don't want to see it here
so sorry
yeah you don't i don't want to see here
either like the mess that we have now
when one jury member is a session one
completely undescribable in
completely absent point from the contest
description as others you remember
uh assess some other side of the
solution and in this case the result is
not
connected to the
uh the submission itself is connected
for example if you have
more
jury members like
from
user interface or more developers this
is uh
that's why we should have a balanced
jury actually so we should have some
representatives having a good technical
skills and some other representatives
having some financial skills and we
should have a significant number of such
jurors that's why there is a contest
already running uh for recruiting
additional jurors here
if we all allow every jury to use their
own scale why do we need the
contest description at all
why do we bother in
jurors
jurors should look at what should be
delivered in the contest and not uh
the country should not regulate on how
they judge
these are two different topics
yeah this is what we are missing here
no uh it's it's uh it's not something
missing so actually we have a procedure
on how to uh
calculate the results price places
actually as that uh for some reason has
failed in the interface uh and i will
check this why why was the reason
although everyone supported it
there's
you can choose between different types
of calculation methodics uh
on winner's side so it can be strict
lose or default mode
i explained this last time so what was
all of this about
but
there should never be as a direct
indication to jurors on how to judge
because in this case we don't need
jurors
have it but but right now uh there are
people with different skills who are uh
assessing uh
complex technical and financial works so
and uh that's really uh
will demotivate first of all them uh
because they do not get uh
such high rewards yeah to to serve such
simple functions you can easily recruit
uh several people who just uh scan
and just put marks so and this will
remove the whole sense of judging by
independent community
yeah because of this i am saying that
all jury members should have the same
scale same criteria you can recommend
but you cannot insist so
it's up to you
to propose it to jurors and uh
they can use or cannot use uh your
proposed scale but if it's helpful for
them so if it's uh fair in uh the ice so
it's okay
but it should not be a condition in the
contest
you are scaring us with the situation
that we have now right now we have a
very dismotivated
contest when every jury
uh uh assisted by his own like
criterious unknown criterias very
different criteria
this is
that we have now
this all very
uh motivated for participants this is a
problem
come on come on guys uh all jurors are
known
if you have some questions to jurors so
please go and ask it's not only
on the other side when jurors should go
and ask participants but it's absolutely
symmetrical
if you have some questions to jurors so
just go and ask
come on and just let's stop this
discussion because it's not fruitful at
all
there will know there will be no
indic direct indication on how to judge
because it
simply will ruin the motivational jurors
and their proficiency
because and nobody knows if this
proposed uh assessment scheme is ideal
or not it's it's only is a uh well let's
call it a market can show it
over there it's an unprovable statement
yeah pretty much it's a assessment scale
can i say hi guys
excuse me for interrupting
but
i have a few words to add i think there
is no in fact contradiction because
uh it's uh that's right that uh proposal
uh contest proposal uh do not uh should
not have any
rules and indication of how to judge but
we have
very complex uh contests and there are
many uh hard criterias and soft
criterias uh inside the contest proposal
and that criterias are uh
already uh indicators of uh how to
measure how to judge
um not not how but what what to do what
okay okay there are two different topics
again uh what to judge right you're
right but uh every point uh
from the contest proposal uh should
should be taken into account i think we
understand this
or everybody understands this so
as i
understand the proposed schema is just a
formalization
of
the scoring not not a measure to
a point
to judge to
make his decision somehow it's just a
formalization to make the
uh
judging clearer clear and and the votes
will be made more transparent will will
be more transparent
it's like
a scoring a card
which
used in many many places uh
many many years
the issue the issue here is that
you uh intentionally frame uh and limit
the extent to which jurors can judge
and areas i know
exactly so so
that's why i'm against this because you
directly uh indicate that you should
should have this area this area and this
area and you should put scores like this
so uh this
just
seems very good but in fact what it does
it
restricts
jurors to certain
judging behavior
and
if they for example see that for example
you have a good
work yeah but it has some drawbacks but
in overall this work deserves the first
place but
due to this framework
this work gets low score
and we are here not to to you know just
uh for uh to run contests for the sake
of context we are here to build the
excellent defy ecosystem
yes that will that will attract users
and that will
actually
create such good products and framing
the judge's decisions is is a bad
precedent
okay i understand you um
i i'm just thinking about uh the
formalization of the criterias written
in the contest proposal but if you think
that uh
every judge
can
bring some
some his own opinion and that opinion uh
should have an ability to prevail over
the technical requirements i understand
you but
not exactly they they uh look there are
hard criteria that should be met uh by
the contest
but how to interpret the level to which
this criteria met it should be up to a
juror
because
if it's written uh in hot criteria that
you should put a smiling face on the
page
you can just take the first shitty
smiley uh from the internet and put it
there or draw it by your hand and make
it organically
integrated into the page uh
both of them are technically met's
requirements
and uh if you directly indicate that uh
you should indicate
binary uh for example that it's met or
not yeah so it's it's not like not
working like this
and believe me there are hundreds of
different criteria uh in a juror's mind
when he's assessing this work he's
comparing
different solutions with each other and
uh
that's why i'm saying it's it's not
prohibited to recommend
some approaches and i believe that over
the time so we will get some kind of uh
good good practice
yes i think yes i think that we can
somehow join two approaches because
um
the proposed approach
makes much more transparency to
some of them absolutely for the tremor
transmissive don't get me wrong okay i'm
just against the uh tight in the hands
of each uh
participant
yes of course we we should
make uh we should
uh leave the ability for for judges to
uh make their own decision and
make the
remark and
comment comments
uh if they think for example that
some solution will not work in the real
life i understand absolutely
and we i think that we should postpone
this very complex question to the next
meeting or so
and uh think about how we can
really improve and make a step forward
in fact
okay
yeah thank you thank you
you had something to say
yeah
well pretty much
everything i wanted to say has been said
by you guys but yeah i i think that we
can we can easily combine two approaches
to leave
um
some space for interpretation for each
other individually and also give them a
framework and
also the reason i wanted to to propose
this is that i i've seen that it was
really hard for judges because of many
different uh contests that were
overlapping and they really had very
small amount of time well very little
time to
to
assess everything and
uh the solutions are really complex so
if they're there's some sort of like a
framework that allows them to
uh to
get basic uh understanding uh of
the heart criteria and of how hard and
soft criteria are met and then also add
some
subjective opinion from them maybe it
will be easier and faster for them and
uh less complex for them to
and less overwhelming for them to you
know
again
you can always recommend and propose
some uh
good approaches so uh
i'm not against this again don't get me
wrong i'm against imposing some
approaches
because it takes out creativity and
freedom of uh jurors
so that's it uh okay so uh sorry guys i
have to to interrupt this discussion
because we have one more topic to
discuss uh sorry thank you thank you
guys for for your opinions
uh
they're really really available
so and it's not an easy question by the
way yeah
a little less can we leave it for the
next time then i guess yeah yes yes
absolutely i will just schedule some
time to discuss next time uh so we have
uh the discussion on the
self-sovereign identity by vladimir so
he has raised his hand already
so we have 15 minutes yet
yeah thank you by the way i raised hands
to to
how to say to
support that answer
about the previous tough topic and the
for sure 100 percent agree that we
start to think and start to implement
dividing to the two group of of
evaluation stuff something formal one
and formal one
by the way the heart criteria in
software theory it is first step to do
that for sure there is a very very
complicated question how to make a
matrix of of
uh supposed
scales or or
marks for
some some
card criteria but anyway it should be
done somehow where it should be
applicable it should be where is not
we we
can discuss or can think about it okay
maybe or maybe
ssi will be a solution sure let's make
by the way yes by the way yes and i will
try to to talk it shortly right now so
about the ssi the cell salary
identification uh we have
four submission and the the voting is is
finished what i'm gonna do
until next call until next thursday is
to connect uh all of that submissions
and all that authors and
talk shortly with them about the how
they
intends to continue this activity or not
are they capable have resources or need
some resources because uh deeply
involved in in this subject
for last months and
meanwhile i'm trying to not trying
started to
outline the
the
next
phase development phase contest whereas
the smart contracts whereas the toolkit
or sdk let's say
for for working with
the id what means digital identities
distributed identities uh in documents
verified credentials for for tom
blockchain for free tone i mean and uh
i i know that one one of team one of the
team already uh requested to talk with
someone with the free tone community
to
to outline uh not mvp but like let's say
the working prototype how ssi uh should
help to to to work with the community
reputation i mean the forum mostly and
i'm offer it uh to to work or to play
with the jurors uh probably the
governance and sub governance members i
mean uh anonymous observed
[Music]
credentials and uh on the next call i'm
gonna present what what i learned from
the teams and probably it should be
draft published to discuss uh for
technical developments uh phase so i'm
very excited on incident i strongly
believe that for reputation we can we
can start on the real
real implementation of ssi on our
blockchain and community that's it okay
okay thank you vladimir uh i'm actually
looking um
from you and other participants of the
first stitch of the contest
the
road map for implementation because ssi
is far more complex than it seems on the
first side
and
exactly
it's
i'm not sure that uh we already have all
the functional elements uh ready in free
time for for now so i may be wrong
hopefully
it's it it should be two or three weeks
later and
i will request the
our gurus in core
frison to discuss it with us because we
already have we already have some
technical guys who are asking me but i'm
it's out of my knowledge to to discuss
on the the
um appropriate level so i will ask the
proxy so probably media will advise some
some people to short
consultants or even the workshop to to
advice
how to and where to look let's say
because because we know it on the
application level and we know it's on
the let's say ssi level and the
but we need to go deeply on the level of
the core level of the working with the
blockchain
okay
so but uh i i just wanted to say that uh
despite that we may not have already
some some blocks for needed for society
to function well uh we at least can
outline the way to go so and
try to to split it in some uh stages
that will just
yeah yeah with deliverables
with two months uh with two months uh
period stage per stage good yeah good
good
yeah there is a ton the id on uh
distributed decentralized id methods
implementation it's
very good
and enough deliverables for
first first stage for
okay very good
by the way but i would like to add here
that the the very important is to like
not
developing some like solution inside a
vacuum
but practical
uh kind of use case like
so so introduce some use case
just as as soon as possible
uh not not just kind of protocol which
is not used anywhere exactly let's let's
do that in the parallel i mean the use
case of the taunt community reputation
it's number one in the jurors and
government members reputation and
activity tracking is number two and
our systems by the way
and our system is number three for sure
because i i know the requests here
[Music]
in this in this case we need to to do
some customer development
with
uh brooks let's say for for dao because
i know it's a hot
topic in
the end of the summer and for jurors in
defy subgauss at least as we heard few
minutes ago as well
yeah yeah
it's not only for the sub gap uh uh it's
actually as we are moving towards uh
creating the
uh
independent groups or proficient jurors
for different uh with different skills
so uh i think the ssi will will fit
there very well
because from developer i'm sorry from
developer standpoint ssi is just three
letters
just
maybe maybe i'm wrong maybe i'm wrong
but but
yeah
can you repeat this just yeah yeah i i
just just want to say that from the
developer's standpoint kind of which is
kind of not
in into not not really into business
kind of stuff it's the ssi concept is
just the three letters uh and it just
about some idea you mean you mean you
mean just just an acronym about
something some some subject rights in
identification
yeah yeah yeah nothing more so i see
yeah
okay and that's why that's why you're
asking about the use case and what's the
real implementation can be right okay
yes yes yes because i understand like i
can like
maybe some have some thoughts about kind
of i'm receiving some achievement here
and then i can disclose this information
to another application and have some
benefits inside it but uh
kind of it's not really formal yeah yeah
from from from the you end user
perspective it's a looking like you said
for sure but for for the developers
it's completely different angle but for
the uh issuer
and verifier right
there are different rules okay we can
discuss it later because it's very
very
uh important to to educate people about
the the the real implementation
that's so and vlad
not about only the jurors but about the
free tone forum as well because i see
that huge flutes about it who the guy
who is very deeply involved in all these
bus it's a roman d or not so probably
ron who who i need to talk with
i think roman d is uh the right person
because he he i think has the most
knowledge about the community of
freetown
um yeah i i i also wanted to add uh
about
the use case of ssi is actually
kara's implementation of self-sovereign
identity identity is is actually the
basic infrastructure layer so if you
remember so we discussed already
in some previous calls that
right now we are still building the
basics so and
these basics are needed to
let us create some more high level
solutions like for example uh
uncollateralized credits so that
requires some scoring models that
require
some better knowledge about the person
and making sure that
this person has attraction on his
history
and for all for example if we would like
to develop some ecommerce stuff
on friton
that will be
purely
web free like with likes to say
uh so uh
there may be
a need to to check some information
about the the customer like i don't know
if he met uh meets certain age criteria
i can buy
just imagine he can buy some beers
online yeah uh but the website needs to
check if he has 18 years already and
with ssi frameworks uh the website can
uh check this information without
disclosing the real identity of the
people for sure and
this is the whole reason um
behind yeah there is a zero zero
knowledge the proof is working up there
as well for sure yeah and yeah we can
mention we can mention it in the request
of the next phase but for sure
in case you said that the website is the
very fire
he he able to to verify or or can bring
the role of issue let's say it may be
useful for our
implementation of our use cases okay i
will try i will try to draft it and put
it on the forum to discussion group as
well
yeah
just just one more thing i want to say
that uh if you uh track
some political news so you may have
heard that european union adopted a new
resolution that
actually uh implements as a signed place
and sure sure there is a standard up
there i have the documents yeah
absolutely as of now
and more than that one estonian company
can contact us and they
who
have integration with that european
standard
the back end the classical one
completely nothing to do with blockchain
at the moment but they uh contacted us
in in dubai in the last events and we
shortly spoke with them about how to
combine is it was the free tone
activities
with the the standard implementation
with european it should be very
interesting as well as estonia is a part
of the european union and probably we
can find some use case or prototyping
there i just wanted to say that uh this
is a good opportunity for freetown to
become
to find some
application
not only for financial purposes and
if return becomes the blockchain
the blockchain that is used by
government governments for
uh
just ssi purposes so it i think it will
be a huge win for the whole blockchain
the for follow of the ecosystem
and uh speaking about estonia that's
actually not maybe everyone knows this
but estonia is one of the purely digital
countries and uh besides the fact that
you can uh open a cryptocurrency company
there
that everybody everybody knows it
actually implemented uh the
digital nomad program that allows
almost everyone from uh from the around
the world to open a company in estonia
with getting just the electronic key
named
residency and
you can manage all your company and all
your needs
with this digital key which is in fact
is a part of the
ssi framework
so uh
yeah so this is just
some some thoughts another one another
one good use case it's the
uh crypto developer let's say or
blockchain developer
most of them or not most but number of
them they do not disclose the the real
identities
there is a reason because they they have
some
enough money in crypto and they trying
to keep the anonymity and so on and but
the the one of the submissions is the
submission number one is to step on he's
bring this idea and say let's let's talk
about that because the
number of people who are developing in
the ethereum let's say and they we
should convert it into the religion of
of the friton let's say but let's start
the platform to attract them for it's
for sure you should blockchain agnostic
i mean that that stuff of uh end user
portal and so on but another one good
use case
so
to disclose to disclose that the track
records the
i don't know the
tv etc but never mind it's a little bit
later in the prototyping in august or
something and now it's the phase to
develop the methods
to create a resolution and be able to
identify the blockchain
okay uh so our time is over actually so
i really thankful to everyone who
participated in the discussion although
we may not uh agree on certain points so
it's good to have to hear different
opinions and let's continue this next
time
so when uh we will specifically allocate
time for this
uh so
i just
wanted to wish you a nice weekend and
talk to you in a week
thank you
bye thank you
bye
