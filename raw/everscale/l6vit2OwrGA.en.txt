hi hi everybody
hello
can you guys hear me yes all good
okay
oops
hello
hi
that must be the gamepad team
cool
nice to see some new faces here
we do
so
let's give one more minute for people to
uh finish coming in
finally i can hear everyone hello
hi
hello welcome
it's a lot of us today huh
not so much sometimes we've got double
um
it always changes depending on who's
presenting what's the topic uh other
holidays going on
changes all the time
give a bit more
question where again the curly team
looks cool though
i dig it
okay i think we should start now i don't
contact
[Music]
uh yeah
[Music]
all right
okay let's start off then
okay hello everybody number 108 welcome
to the everscale weekly community call i
hope you're doing all well uh many of
you might have just come over from the
joint ama that we were holding uh
regarding joint regarding our plans on
staying strong and weathering the crypto
storm
so now you know that we are resilient
and we are moving on and with everstart
they just had a token sale launch a
couple days ago on the everstart launch
pad of course
uh this was their platform's utility
token which allows users to receive a
guaranteed allocation at the price of
the soft cap
so if you are interested in that getting
a token at a good price you should go
check that out on everstart
and speaking of tokens some octus bridge
users have
already been able to
experience some benefits from the recent
update of the bridge
which allows one to root tokens from
different networks inside of everscale
which is great
so broxah says that uh this is the first
taste of what merge functionality will
achieve for the bridge and will soon be
possible for
more tokens coming soon
it's exciting um and if you think that
the telegram chats have been getting a
little bit quiet recently that's
probably due to the huge kick in discord
activity we've had um notably at the end
of may
if you haven't been there in a while you
should go and check it out there are a
lot of new channels there's focus on
international communities there's
developer updates uh and core team
updates and a lot more
mid-may we had about 1.2 k active users
and by the end of may there was almost
4k which is a lot of growth that's great
progress
and finally give a shout-out to the
winners of the everscale meme contest
they were just announced and first place
went to shogun
this this person bagged 500 evers and
five bridge tokens so if you want to see
the results of the meme contest and the
uh submissions you should head on over
to the meme channel in discord and
congrats to everybody involved there
so with that said we can move on to the
agenda
i see that we've got a lot of people now
on the call which is great
uh let's kick it off with the reveland
ido and reveland is holding an ideo on
multiple launch pads and in particular
our own everstart
and we have alex to
share some more with us
hello
hi
hi let me share
thank you joe
let me share my screen first please
yes
okay
okay can you see my screen yeah all good
awesome
so yeah let me introduce
reveland on everstart
as joe has noted it's a game a quite a
popular game by the way even though it's
an early phase but it's already popular
with a huge battery test program
they are launching their ideo on
multiple platforms and that was a huge
success by everstart team to get them
with us will never start
uh
i just want a little bit about dreamland
what is that what's what's the game and
why i should be interested in it and
buying their river talking on never
start
it is like simply put it's a blockchain
game it's dota if you know dota it's
quite the popular game it's on
blockchain simply put
you can
team up team up with your friends
build teams and fight each other destroy
your friends bases or you can even play
in a
pubg mode where you can play solo
against many many other participants so
there are multiple
multiple how to say scenarios to choose
from which makes this game really
exciting
and
in this game you operate with the hero
we can see the examples of heroes here
you don't need even to pay to start the
game
you can start with three uh
free free heroes if i'm not mistaken
they they're providing them for free but
if you want more heroes more skins
you're welcome to
visit their
nft place and buy some more
sophisticated heroes or skins or weapons
or whatever you need in this game
so this is the idea of the game
it is backed up by very serious partners
huawei
gaming and alumni research to name a few
and yes they are coming on everstart
they are already there you can you can
check everstart website and uh
in
there you can find the information and
brief information about the game and the
brief information about the sale it
starts pretty soon it starts on 18th of
june and it will last for just a couple
of days
there you can also find the links to
their website
links to their social medias where you
can learn more about the game
and yeah we encourage you to come and
get get the token and
if i understand correctly with this
token you can even get a
mystery box with a hero
or with skin so it will not be just a
talking
it will be a little bit more than just
the talking it will give you a great
in-game experience if you want to play
the game for sure
and just a small life hack
ever start
and they're talking start which are
starting
today as you have said
you can use start talking to get a
guaranteed allocation with travel
because initially
the amount is quite limited so don't
miss it out
come on join everstart and uh yeah don't
miss out this
amazing idea
okay great
yeah that's it from my site mystery box
i'm already interested that sounds cool
i'm definitely going to check that out i
wonder i wonder what the sentiment in
the community is um
because i didn't really see it
shared too much so i wonder if we should
start
talking about it more in the chats and
uh getting people involved i think it'd
be pretty successful
this good project
i think so although all information is
available on the chat so if you forget
something you can always find a post or
or a i don't know telegram message
they're already there so yeah just look
at it and don't miss it out again
because it's quite a short period of
time to get into that
yeah it is three days right
yep
okay
thank you alex for sharing that super
cool and we're going to move on uh with
the agenda going to the remote election
tech report we have eugene he's been
sharing every scale's initiatives with
with the
gba government blockchain association
and today he has the final version of
the remote election technical report
which is a very important document and
apparently it's going to be uh sent to
every election official in the u.s
eugene
yes hello hello um can you hear yes and
i can okay so thank you for
inviting me to speak so um this uh story
has its roots in um
a contest that we as a community run
uh roughly a year and a half ago
to dispute some of the criticism that
mit
researchers put forward with respect to
the use of blockchain in voting
we uh decided to come back with a
solution and uh
part of the process was talking to
various people in the u.s to see what
their thoughts their views were
on the criticism of blockchain
and as a result a group of
scholars i should say was formed
under the auspices of the government
blockchain association
which included and this is very
important
the most
local proponents
and opponents of the use of blockchain
in elections
so um what is very significant about
this report is its signatories
you will see here
that in addition to
us
being a signatory there is an or there
are a couple of organizations uh that
you may or may not have heard about but
they are very well known in the us and
they are verified the voting
foundation
and a company called vaults
essentially uh verified voting
is run by the elections assistance
committee
part of u.s congress
and therefore they represent the camp
of those that say paper only
there should be no remote voting on
mobile devices or any devices whatsoever
and there are other people like gba like
us which believe that technology is
there
to allow people to vote from their
mobile devices
this is all about bringing more people
uh to express their choices uh polling
stations have very long lines
sometimes very long commute to them
and so the actual attendance is low
so whenever we talk about mobile voting
we talk about a huge increase in people
actually expressing their views and this
is why it is significant so
what this report was about is
something that both proponents and
opponents of blockchain agree on and
that is
the actual practices that are allowed by
legislature in various states in america
so this describes
what is possible today and indeed
there are about 15 counties in five
states
that do allow
remote ballot marking and return
so this document and it's the first one
ever
signed by both proponents and opponents
uh indicates what is legal in the united
states today
how why is it relevant for us
well as you can see
everscale is represented here as one of
the subject matter experts
this is the perfect position we want to
be in
uh to be not political we don't take any
sides we're just technical matter
experts and this document confirms
indeed that we have achieved that status
this is actually a product of roughly
a year and a half
of work of this group and uh there are
some very notable names in it as well
including uh susan eustis
who is a legend in the elections
industry he invented some 50 years ago
the first ever vote counting machine
still sells them
to election officials and is a very very
influential
person in the industry so she signs as
well
so
to wrap this up this document indeed
with our signatures is going as joe said
to every local election official in the
country
all of them will see everscale as
subject matter experts in elections
so you might want to ask what's next
well
the second part of the work of this
group will be about what is possible
and there we are hoping to see our very
own
devote
and
the audit i'm very happy to report that
not only the develop has been
piloted in the u.s but also deal audit
is now being discussed with some key
experts in the united states so we're
hoping
that the new document will highlight the
marvelous technical solutions that
our community has developed thank you
very much for your attention i'm happy
to answer the questions john
fantastic presentation eugene thank you
very much this is this is definitely
amazing um
and certainly an impressive working
group as well um i don't does anybody
have any questions for eugene on the
call
i don't see any hands up
um
i haven't seen anything in uh youtube
but perhaps by the end of the call we
have some
some more questions
uh
thank you very much eugene definitely
looking forward to the second phase of
this um seeing it in action
and voting for the next u.s president um
through everscale technology thank you
very much
so
can you uh stop sharing your screen and
we shall move on uh with the agenda
just checking if we do have questions
no
okay so we have some new faces on the
call today some curly headed uh super
team faces they are called gamepad
gamepad has experienced some
massive success lately
particularly in china and they gained
over 12k new addresses in just one week
i believe and it keeps accelerating very
excited so we have uh some of the core
members of the team here so please
introduce yourselves and
tell us more
uh you're on mute
technology women in technology
so anyways um hi everyone nice to meet
you my name is elena i'm the creative
strategist and partner of gamepadbot
which is a social competitive mobile um
hyper casual gaming platform
and i'm here with the members of my team
um
pavel pavel kuznetsov who is he's on
mute and off
of video right now but he's also very
curly uh max our seo and a couple of
members during the new business
so we're very happy to join you and um i
would love to know how much time we have
in order to present ourselves because
we're not very aware about the format so
i just know how fast i should go in
order to do so well how much time do you
need i think well
i can go through the pitch within like
maybe five seven minutes very quickly i
think that's great
perfect
then um
do i have the authority to share the
screen let me just i think so let me
know if you don't
yes i'm trying
yep a little color a little color nice
[Laughter]
so just give me a second before i go
into the slide sharing mode
and
wait a second where it is slideshow
so i would just be very very quick and
thorough if you have any questions we'll
go over it so over again but you started
from the ant so where we are already you
know like through our stage of you know
showing certain results so what we are
is the gamepad bot is this social uh
competitive
casual mobile
gaming platform that exists in telegram
and discord right now what we do is we
create little simple games that are
presented on the platform that allow
users to play learn and start earning in
cryptocurrencies
since the games are very simple and easy
to play we have the ability to actually
bring users to enlightenment into the
crypto industry very quickly what we
represent right now is the very simple
and uh very simple way to distribute and
present games on the platform so which
is very interesting tool for either
gamers users and game developers
we believe and we represent ourselves as
the inclusive gaming ambassador working
with uh women in tech and very much
looking forward um for equality in the
gaming industry
um
we do um one of the most well
like focuses of the platform itself is
bringing enlightenment to the new
economy so bringing light and learning
possibilities and uh yeah and we are
going through ico which is part of our
uh main idea of developing the platform
with you and hopefully with everscale
ecosystem
so as i said we believe in ourselves as
a little game changer addressing human
needs and providing life simplifiers
adopting blockchain technologies through
massive
focus on gamified solutions
we believe in women and games and do
represent an ambassador for that
platform itself right now covers over
100 different games and we are
developing different
structures and um inside play rooms
which would be dedicated to different um
topics and different um
stories so we could um use more
purposeful gaming inside
itself right now before we entered the
chinese market the platform itself was
populated by 5.5 4 million of users over
100 games were created online but we are
we're starting to work with uh hopefully
with um
independent developers and buddha we we
signed contract with wudo not so long
ago so they will be able to provide some
content for us
um the platform is um yeah it's it's
it's developing over like just five days
severely and very quickly what we are
right now is the gaming platform but
what we
come to believe is creating it more into
a social tool where users will be able
to create their own playrooms and use
marketplace in order to create
customized playrooms so moving from idea
of being a game player to game
interpreter so developing the industry
itself
um
we believe that the platform right now
has a great ambition to be interesting
for game and players for developers for
investors and for commercial partners
because by
bringing a lot of traffic it becomes a
very great marketing tool um
as i said um how we see it is playing to
learn to earn and that's the main idea
of actually you know bringing becoming
more human tool for people to actually
interact with the uh with the new
economies and doing it in a very
simplified way
um there are more information about how
we see the platform developing i don't
know whether it's relevant right now but
the main idea is actually moving from
the idea of game exploration to becoming
a brand ambassador
in gaming industry and by bringing that
ability to every single user that starts
playing the games on the platform and
and next
from different stage owns to different
platforms i mean like different stages
of its personal development
uh there's more information on the page
that is probably not very relevant right
now
but um hopefully you will get the chance
to uh to check out our platform we'll
share the link right now and everyone
will have the ability to go through the
games
uh and see how it works i mean we did
have great results within this five days
we just shared the link on the community
on the chat well within your chinese
community
62 000 plus uh 15 000 new crypto wallets
open so it well it seems that
the tool that we're creating is actually
working and if we have the ability to
develop it further on within the ever
scale
ecosystem it would become
a great cooperational
vector for our development
thank you very much uh if there's any
questions or if i was not very focused
on uh things that you wanted to hear
please address questions and we'll be
happy to answer them
thank you very much elena that's a
fantastic presentation it's so vibrant i
really love this style
um
can you can you tell us a bit more about
um your plans uh with everscale how
might this benefit the community
why would they be interested in gamepad
but like how might it affect the token
or community engagement for example
uh what are the incentives for the
community
well i mean first of all one of the main
ideas behind it is
a very motivating simplified tool to get
into the ecosystem and start using evers
ever evers
because we give the ability to open the
crypto wallets inside the game but it
works the gamified way so first you
start playing the game which is very
simple and you already have the ability
to earn so by having the ability to earn
starting with zero you know that you
already have the possibility of actually
making money on your gaming experience
so that's a simple way to get into the
system and the simple way to get and
it's fun and entertaining way to get
into the ecosystem and start being a
part of the
of the um
let's put away um a getaway to fun with
the ability to earn so that that's what
uh we saw as a as a as a as a certain
benefit you know for the platform itself
because i mean right now we live in a
society where uh people are players we
live in uh you know with the grown-ups
that want to you know still continue
be on the play mode and that's uh that's
a perfect way to do so and that that
could be one of the getaways for a
forever skills ecosystem you know like
to um to join something uh something
well to create a different way a passage
to create a different passage into the
industry
and uh that also gives us ability and uh
possibility to work with the audiences
that have
will
create massive more massive adoption of
crypto tools because right now i guess
it's one of the
um in order to start talking serious you
first of you first to have to get the
chance to play and emotionally wise you
know it gives you an opportunity of not
losing much so that's also you know a
more
emotionally simplified way to getting
into the more important and serious
business
so um that's uh that was one of our
personal proposals to become and a part
of the ecosystem that would create
entertaining and content wise and then
the second part also a simple and more
um well a way to distribute content to
work with with the developers that's um
um well everscale has you know a number
of tools that simplifies work for
developers so that could be another
marketplace for for content that is
developed using your tools
um second yeah i guess the content
distribution as well
we have a very loyal personal community
right now and then with your help we can
also enlarge it so by bringing benefits
to both each other
okay
excellent
that's a lot of information thank you
very much
well that makes sense now
very cool i wonder how many people are
going to go check it out now learn more
and maybe kind of
create their own games too
let's see what does it do that that's
the plan because right now it's the
platform itself that represents the
games and where we're moving with it is
the ability to actually personalize it
and create game rooms
very cool
yeah thank you elena thank you very much
thank you thank you from the gamepad bot
team too thank you for coming on the
call
uh does anybody have any questions for
the team
i don't see anything popping up
perhaps not well it was very clear so
uh maybe they'll ping you in the chats
if somebody comes up with something
but i think um that's pretty much all
for our very quick call today um unless
anybody wants to jump in
then i think we're done
thank you for joining this week and stay
tuned for
updates from easy pay and our chinese
community and much more next week have a
great week everybody bye bye
bye
[Laughter]
know
you
