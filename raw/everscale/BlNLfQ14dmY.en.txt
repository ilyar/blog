there we go we're live
we have critical mass i think we're good
to go
yeah
okey dokey let's go uh hi everybody
welcome to everscale community call
number 95. good to see everyone back
glad to see some new faces by the way
come back every week same same time same
place um
i think we have what i would say is a
gold standard level call today excellent
presentations coming your way we have uh
ever surf that you're going to hear from
we have two uh everscale grant winners
that are with us and of course we're
going to hear from mita we're going to
hear it from ben but before we start
let's do the usual thing that we do and
just go through some very simple rules
please turn your cameras on uh unless
you're naked
in which case turn your cameras down and
do a little dance for us
uh please save your questions until each
presenter is finished with their
presentation
please use the raise hand feature and
zoom to do so uh if you're watching us
on youtube there's a comment section
please leave your question there and
we'll get to it at the very end of the
call
we have some questions that were written
into us which we'll uh cover throughout
the course of this call and of course
everything is in english only so
i guess uh let's dive right in i know me
to blew us off last week but uh he's
here with us this week and has some
things to share about technical updates
so me too if you want to take it away
yeah sure
well um
we uh
so first of all for the network update
um
we have started um
the process of on devnet it's a very
hard uh actually very complicated
process of the network update this time
it's
it's breaking everywhere on every level
sdk everything
so um
[Music]
we
i think that devnet will be operational
with the new updates
later today we're struggling with ci
currently and coordination of everything
so nothing breaks but the update has
been tested on internal networks so now
we we just need to test the migration
process
like the update itself works well it's
uh it's the immigration from the
previous version which is really hard to
do
there are more than 30 changes and uh
a lot of them are just incompatible
so uh it's it's it's it's quite a mess
uh anyway uh i hope that the devnet will
be
will be kind of updated today later
today or tomorrow and uh
then we will allow for like days some
days of testing on the devnet or
reporting any issues that you may have
and then we will move to update
the mainnet not sure it will happen this
week it depends how the testing on
devnet is going but
um
[Music]
well we're moving with that so that's
this is good uh
good news it's it's a lot of uh it's a
hell of a work
and uh this work a lot of that is
disrupted over the last couple of weeks
of course you understand why
as we're continuing to
[Music]
move people
from
um
from
unpleasant locations to more pleasant
locations
say this
that's not all though
and
i would like to announce that
we're going to release the public beta
of flex on devnet
today
so it's it's already
kind of working still fixing some minor
issues
and we will release
the
url and also there will be in a testing
group for flex
um in telegram that or or discord didn't
decide yet but
i mean it will it will it will be
launched today
and you are welcome to test uh it works
on the devnet uh you're welcome to test
that
and report us any issues or whatever
comments you have for for flex
it's still uh it will still work over
the browser which is not
the the case um it won't be the case for
the for the
production
um as flex is a standalone application
but
just for the testing purposes for the
easiest testing purpose and because
there are no issues with the
well private keys
because of the test net
then we will we will continue like that
for
uh for a couple of weeks
before we move to production basically
this version of flex
is
the production the version one kind of
kind of release
the only thing we will
uh gonna do before we move to uh to
production
apart from
audit and
and verification
of the of the like changes that we made
to flex and there are a lot of them like
it's just a huge amount of changes that
were introduced over the last two months
um
there will be immigration
uh part of the great immigration
protocol which we will add
immigration protocol is important
because obviously we will upgrade
um
the contracts and introduce new features
to flex
but um as you all probably experienced
from broxas upgrades uh that happened to
broxo's
products over the last month you know
it's it's a problem if you don't plan it
ahead
of time right
so
it's it could be a messy messy stuff
so we have
created a special upgrade protocol
and like we want to think about that
ahead of time
so this protocol implementation is
ongoing and uh so it will take us like a
couple of weeks maybe like two to two
weeks to
finish the implementation of migration
protocol once it's done we will more
flex the production so so
subject to testing of course
so that's that's flex news
then i got questions from ron should i
answer them
now yeah absolutely
okay so i got some questions first
question about the bot technology
um when will the boat technology develop
um guys the boat technology developed
already
more than a year ago and it works quite
well everything you see in surf for
example which we'll see today as well
uh it's based on debots
and flex is all
based on the bots it's it's just one
huge debate basically or many actually
debunks
and there is nothing else there are no
web servers in the middle
so everything all the experience
flexes underneath is a debug and debug
browser
working so what is the plan for
developing of the technology the plan
for developing the bots of just
developing the bots that's the plan and
continuing to add features and
nikita
manahaf is doing great job on on that
part and other people who are involved
in that and um
there will be also a debate browser
browser which flex is based on which
will be open sourced and so you you
could also enjoy
uh developing for for if you if you want
interfaces like that for the bots but
other than that you just need to take
the bot um
like engine and uh and you can do
whatever you want for that you can you
can develop and
so on so it works fine
what tools are being used for plan to be
used okay communication with the
community users of technology i don't
understand that question but
the um
probably question not to me i don't
understand what it means
to develop communications with the
community of users
of this technology well this is like
what we have now is communication for
example
there are forums and groups and so on
uh okay and then the second question
which is important and i saw a lot of
validators are whining about this
and that's we're talking about dark
pools
yeah
so dark pools are
um are developed already
um
we are reviewing
the
one contract right now which is uh um
because dark pools
how they work you deposit
the money in the dark pool
and then
um
the community sends money
like whatever is agreed doesn't matter
someone sends money on the for the
second leg
of the deposit
and there are parameters of the locks
lock lock times two parameters of two
locks times one lock time is how long
you should wait until the money is
arriving from the community givers and
then for how long the whole thing is
locked right so two parameters
and
but then after this first
time is passed has passed
then this money is deployed somewhere
um
for example in in
the version two
version three whatever depots right the
the elector contract i would
uh for example so in order to do that
there is a there is a target contract
address set up in in dark pool and
then this target contract has just it's
just just an empty contract with the
with the set code function
so in order to like get your funds into
this the new contract whatever it is the
lecture whatever
the target contract is you need to
activate the set code but
who is actually need to activate this
the set code
if just developers would activate it
they can well not saying but it's
possible that they could be a malicious
attack on
on the on the code of the of the
contract that and they could for example
take all the money
so we have developed it's not entirely
part of the dark pool but it's important
addition
and
what we did is we created an smb
um
smv voting
between all the dark poor pool members
to vote for the set code
and this edition was written it's done
it's ready but
so that one is just need a review which
will take uh
probably a week or something
and after that
then um
the other thing that we have been
developing or provender has been
developing actually is is a front end
for for dark pulse
but
that does not
prevent
releasing this um for
uh rust cup for example
right dark pool so
bottom line what i'm saying is that once
this set code part
set set code smv voting part is tested
we're ready to go
so i think and then and then it's
administrative decisions which are not
mine like that's the governance um which
need to take these decisions
uh the code is available i will post the
link to the code
to the repository it's not on github
it's a private git laptop repository so
i will post the
the link to the codes in
some channels i don't know today
and you can review the contracts
yourself there are you will see there
are two types of contracts one is
written on in ursus
which you probably won't be able to
review but well you will see that it's
an ursus contract
and then the translation of resource
contracts and the solidity so there will
be ursus source code and solidity source
code
all created by preventa team and um and
you can review that and we will also
going to review that
um we'll take as i said probably a week
and um
and after that again it will be down to
governance to decide when
to move and when to distribute the rest
cup or whatever money they want to
distribute for this contracts but this
contract will be available
i think that's um
well from me if you have any question
please
thank you media very much very
interesting stuff uh we do have a
question ivan
yeah as always
uh yeah i just wanted to ask about the
smd thing
uh like uh smv for what for the code
which will be then pushed to all of the
contracts where the money are deployed
or or how
yes
so yes so so we make one voting for the
code
then the voted code is like uh with this
code we update all the stops yes
exactly okay
got it and the second question not not
really a question yeah yeah this is the
question uh thank you for for announcing
the sources thing i was
kind of looking forward for it for for
maybe a half a year uh that pretty
interesting reading i i expect that to
be
and i want just to ask will there be a
compile instructions for ourselves or
will or is it just a code which we
cannot touch and change yeah nothing
nothing at this point it is not a
release of forces
but the just the release of source code
of smart contracts that treatment rules
um their ursus uh is still in
development and there is no
documentation so like it's an inhuman
to really it's a coke
code by itself as a human
and without any instructions it's uh
it's kind of in human inhuman
in uh well
exponentially inhuman
i don't know so we should wait until um
until prevent the team
finds time to kind of um
make that more
developer friendly i would say
but nevertheless it's written in ursus
it's the first actually production ready
system which is written in orsos i think
by just that is already i think quite
important step
yeah
okay cool thank you
absolutely thank you ivan for your
question michael you have a question
yeah hi guys uh michael could you please
explain to me like a non-techie guy uh
why don't we need an extra language like
it's versus here well we have c plus
uh
based smart contracts and solidity
basement cortex so we are introducing a
third language
which will like you know won't make the
life of the developers easier so what's
the concept on behind this thank you yes
sure
well first of all i'm not the person who
really need to speak about ursus
and we may but once it's ready to go for
developers adoption where we're going to
of course uh like um
invite
andrew lasham who is an author of this
language to present it i'll just say
just a couple of words
these are not competing languages
solidity and c plus plus are high level
languages courses cannot be regarded as
well it's high level language but
it's very specialized language
ursus is by itself translated into
solidity so you need to remember that so
it's a kind of
up
or down language
from that depends on what you're looking
for
the reason
for developing ursus is to develop a
language which will be
uh which will be
formally verified in verifiable kind of
easily by design
so when you write a contract on ursus
it takes
basically if you look at the formal
verification process right now which uh
which we're developing and you know
every scale is one of the leading if not
the leading i think actually the leading
blockchain and formal verification
currently
and
the provenda approach prevent the team
approach
is to actually
instead of taking the smart contract and
going through the whole process of
manually formally verified which is very
very hard very long process
so andrew came up with this
language which
is actually
you take what they do right now is they
take solidity or c plus plus contracts
and they write them in ursus
instead of translating them into
theorems on on
they write them
inorso's language
and then
and then because ursus is actually
in a way
so then they use this to prove
in
okay
and um
that just shortened the process
tremendously
like it
really it's like it makes the process of
formal verification
um like really really
like ten times easier
all right but doesn't it make the
development uh a bit no it does not
harder it is not making development
easier it is making formal verification
easier so
michael not everything that you do
in engineering
is you do just to make it easier
sometimes you also make it
better
or safer
or faster and so on and it's always a
compromise
so i apologize
yeah
that's just one ten seconds so ursus is
to make it safer not easier to make it
safer and easier to make it safer for
people who make safer so if you
bottom line is if you write a contract
that is going to hold billion
dollars
i think
for you it's better to write it in order
source but if not
you write it in solidity and if you want
to go to formal verification someone
will rewrite it in our source just to
make it easier to formally verify that's
all thank you yeah uh
no no michael uh so i i i apologize i
rarely do this but i have to cut
everybody off right now because we have
to get to our uh next presentation yeah
okay okay thank you but but me too we'll
stick around so we we can pick this back
up afterwards so um our next
presentation um our very own
ever so lovely joanne
um and also the slightly less lovely yet
equally as important uh andre galushkin
both colleagues of mine never ex what
can i say all friends but we have some
really cool stuff i'm not going to get
in the way i'm going to let them do it
and joanne i know you have to go first
so if you would please tell us yes sir
thank you very much mr ronald
uh i do have some things to share and
i've got to show you guys maybe just two
sentences from me first
and uh while you're sharing so hi
everyone i'm anna one of the co-founders
of every turf the most popular skill
browser
and the tim and i were working hard
for a lot of time and today we want to
present uh some great news to you
and joanna would help us with the
presentation and uh then she would need
to run away and
we would proceed maybe with andrew so
jonah the four of yours thank you
thank you anna i i hope everybody can
see the screen all good yep
so uh we've put together a little
presentation together with ann eugene
andre and more surf team altogether is
proud to present the surf utility token
as well as some pretty great incentives
for getting in early
um i'm sure everybody knows that
eversurf has a unique user interface and
a debug
um
which allows everyone of any technical
proficiency to interact with the
blockchain which is great and now the
team is introducing the surf token which
is going to bring this benefit to
everybody
so here's the presentation
which is accessible
right from the website
um
the most
let's go down yeah one of the most
important facts
um that all of us are likely guilty of
doing is forgetting that we are
in this inner circle you know we are
part of this one percent and for
possibly a thousand different reasons
the adoption of such technology with
potential to alleviate many of the
world's challenges is still extremely
low
but there are however some very
well-known and well-documented
challenges such as you know user
interface issues the reputation and the
paradox of choice being some pretty top
problems that both users and service
providers face
so
eversurf has recognized these challenges
and has developed this solution you know
of being a very simple intuitive and
secure interface
on just one platform do we have the
possibility of connecting thousands of
different service providers and users
all at once you know there's no
knowledge of code needed there's no
buzzwords there's no security risks we
all know it's decentralized fast and now
connects
users and providers
so you can buy and sell store and
exchange save earn collect nfts and much
more on everscale all safe and fast
so for those who haven't used surf
extensively
you may think it's limited to being like
a wallet or means to staking or maybe
you've signed some transactions or
voted with it for example um but it's
much more and it's going to be so much
more
you know it's it's also a secure
messenger with potential to replace
telegram you could browse or integrate
your nfts
you could benefit or build with dbot
technology
you can order a security card which you
can configure for pretty much anything
you could think of you know maybe it's
just as simple as signing transactions
or using it as a private key card for
your office for example for a real live
use case
so there's you know
there's a reason why surf may be the
most trusted ever scale browser for
define nft
and it's becoming an all-in-one
blockchain tool
you need whether you're a user or a
provider
so let's take a look at the roadmap
you can see that the team is definitely
not short on things to do we have a
really robust roadmap
with some exciting things for everybody
from basic users those who want to spend
their evers
borrow tokens trade
and of course developers and service
providers
and surf is becoming very robust and
don't worry because tomorrow
the team will be holding an ama
so we'll have enough time to really dive
into the details of everything on the
roadmap and answer all of your questions
that may come up after this
brief intro
so
talking about the go to market um
you can see an overview of the go to
market strategy here and various ways
that the surf utility token will be
integrated you know there's plans for
simple onboarding
uh for example there's a secondary
market for defy
hello
which means we would provide
just kidding
yeah um so we would provide an
easy to use interface for the existing
exchanges like flat cube for example
and of course there's the partnership
with the flex decks which is pretty cool
so let's talk about the token
from the
the slides above
um
you can kind of understand how the surf
utility token is designed to act as a
bridge between users and service
providers you know when i say service
providers it's it's
a range but you know you can think of
startups for example
so they will have this interface like a
dbot
and benefit from access to the
blockchain audience and the surf
ecosystem i'm sure
that
everybody on the call i'm sure you all
know what a utility token is but maybe
there are some newbies here or maybe
some people who are watching youtube
so i just want to
clear it and say you know
tell you what a utility token is that
it's essentially a tool
that can grant beholders special access
or benefits and some well-known examples
are follow coin batch you know the basic
attention token um and they're they're
pretty popular ones if you want to learn
more about it to look into and
you could think about a utility token is
is something that can just pretty much
serve about any purpose that a developer
wants it to
but they also do have value
you know they're not considered money
as such you know as straightforward as
like a
coin like ever
but the tokens
do provide value to holders you know in
different ways
like it can provide early access to
future products or services
promotions and the surf token is not
short of these benefits
there's a loyalty program too
so um
in order for the platform to benefit all
parties everybody who wants to use it
this is where the surf utility token can
actually shine
users have a comprehensive tiered
loyalty program
you know and you can see that there's
cash back there too which is great
and the guarantee that service providers
are legit
because they have to lock their funds
service providers will lock their tokens
and this helps them to access
this thriving audience
within the surf ecosystem
and use the platform and tools
so
tokens that's what you're all here for
right let's talk about it
um
so we want to introduce something very
special to you
uh the seed sale has
just ended sold out and it was a success
which the team is
thrilled about
and
we'd like to talk about um
bringing it to you guys now because we
have the seed sale which was just for
partners we have the strategic sale
which is for the early adopters and core
contributors
such as you guys you find folks on the
call then we'll have the private sale
which will be for launch pads like
killer whale
and the
community sale
here
which is pretty much open to the
blockchain community and the public sale
for anybody on
the app and if you want to learn more
about it
you just hover over and you can see the
time frame here
the
strategic sale started today the 15th
and runs until the 30th so you have time
to get on board
and each day that passes you know the
threshold is a bit lower but it gets a
bit more expensive
so
of course get in early if you like a
good price
so as you can see there's also a
dedicated deebot in the corner that you
can just click it goes right into
into surf
and it's very intuitive easy to set up
if you want to get in early then i would
just suggest to
go over to the website click through to
the token and you'll find yourself over
here
and um
so if you're
a user or an investor um
it's
it's good to know that eversurf is
growing and we would really like you to
be part of this journey
and tomorrow the surf team will be
holding the ama
and hopefully you attend and ask any
question i'm sure
there are some burning questions and
we'll have more time to dive deeper into
all the details
and that's about it
follow the socials
stay informed
what time is the ama tomorrow
and i think it's 3 p.m central european
time
2 3 p.m cet that's 2 p.m
utc
excellent
yeah waiting for your questions i would
be
happy to answer them or to discuss this
program in more details
for me i want to add that uh our first
integration based on surf tokens would
be with the ever serve gift cards
presented i think a week ago
it is currently in alpha stage and there
you can buy your
real gift cards forevers and
with this program you would be able to
get some cash back
back
so
see you tomorrow thank you for your
attention thanks joe
for your help with the presentation
thank you joanne thank you man uh did
anybody have anything to add
yeah um can i also add a few words
absolutely
yeah yeah hi everyone yeah uh thank you
all i thank you and you are for the
presentation here i'll just add that
there are several options to buy
software against uh you can buy it
through the keyboard um
uh and you can also buy it for like btc
or other tokens just uh if you have like
if you need it just send us email or
contact with us directly and we'll uh
create the order and make it make a deal
so there's your options so you can buy
it for the evers or
other tokens also
yep that's it that you wanted to add it
thank you andrew thank you very much
yeah we have a question from the
audience uh ben
uh not so much a question just a uh
statement i tried out the gift card say
well last week now actually and it works
really well my other half has a lovely
pair of new shoes on the way so great
work to the surf team
thank you
nice to hear it
excellent um i can tell you there were a
few questions that were written in uh
but i know joanne has to run um so
whoever else is from the surf team
please stick around to answer those
questions as we as we move forward uh
ivan yeah
uh yeah will the price of surf talking
rise to the moon
sure i know
you i think you know the answer
no it's not
the price of the surf token will be
rising within uh
upcoming 10 days
so in 10 days from now it will be
more than 0.2 and the price will be
already rising
yeah it would start riding in five days
from the 21st of march
and it would rise uh each day and the
minimal location will go down so
if you have
a small sum of tokens to spend on twelve
trucks you can wait but it would be
much higher price it's it's the other
way around it means that the price of
the token will rise very shortly
yep thank
you okay
thank you very much thank you everybody
uh thank you for the presentation
excellent interesting news
uh but
we have to move on we have some more
presenters uh
we're gonna hear from a couple of ever
scale grant winners uh last week and the
week before last we heard from uh
everscale startup competition winners
and we haven't heard much about the
people who receive grants uh i know
there are already questions for some of
the uh uh grant recipients so
uh we have uh spatium
i hope we're pronouncing that correctly
by the way uh and game pay with us so
let's go in order let's start with
spatium uh we have uh vasily i see he's
here with us
um spaceship provides a
white label client gateway to everscale
i don't think i need to
say how important that is i think
everybody understands it's awesome stuff
so vasily please tell us about spaceship
yeah hi everyone pleasure pleasure to
meet you all and we are really excited
to become a part of every scale
community and it's really awesome
what you do guys and we hope that
with our product we will be we will be
able to raise it soon
of course
so basically what we do is as you've
said ron as what we do is we are
creating some sort of gateway for
uh already existing products into the
crypto
so
mainly that is and the gateway here is
the wallet so let me share my screen and
i will show you how the things work okay
so hopefully you can see my screen now
yes we can
okay awesome
uh so what you'll see now is our uh like
a demo
wallet that is
already published in all the stores
and that is where uh sf asset foundation
to which will integrate ever first uh
together with uh octus bridge itself
flat cube and all those awesome features
that the everscale brings to the
community
so from the first uh
the first thought that comes to all the
people okay that's another crypto
wallets so what's so special about that
uh how is the recent there are some sort
of features which are unique
to the wallet crypto market as well as
we are not like an ordinary wallet
so that's basically what you see here is
the box solution which can be customized
to the needs of
any
any like any business so for instance we
already have a bank and
banks and
exchange clients who already launched
the wallet we changed the ui here as
well as the branding and they go to
market like within a week or two with
already existing wallet so let me show
the registration flow and
while i'll be doing the
demonstrating the wallet i will describe
what are the features that will be
provided to the ever community
so the registration is quite simple
all you need to do is just provide your
email
and that's mainly it so what
differentiates us from the other wallets
on the market
uh is that
we
do not have a private key so our wallet
is keyless we use this smpc secure
motivated computation for that
and instead of a private key we have uh
two independent secrets one is generated
on the user's device for instance here
it's my mobile phone and it wasn't as
the other one stored stored on the side
of a server it could be for instance for
this wallet it's patient server
uh and as well as it could be the server
for instance open exchange or for
instance any project on the ever
ecosystem
so and of course here comes the one of
the problems which uh
is like a regular one for the private
keys is how to backup a private key and
in our case as client secrets and for
this purpose we have two options so
currently i'm not able to do anything
inside the wallet
so what i'll need to do is i need a
backup here
and i have two options so the first one
is classic it's secure code similar to
the seed phrase that no one loves
uh however we decided it's really hard
for the majority to use the seat phrases
and qr codes and we are aiming directly
for the majority of users who are not
really familiar with the krypton how
things work
and that's why we partnered and created
us like a separate product the project
for that and it's anonymous biometrics
which backups the client secrets and why
we call it synonymous because at the end
of the day we do not store any private
data of the user
so we do not store any face images
as well as videos or embeddings like the
personal space features let me show how
the biometrics things work
so it's quite similar to the face id
experience
so what i need to do so you can see my
face right even right now
so what i need to do is to cover the
circle
by rotating my head
and that's mainly it so currently we a
set of neural networks is learned to
provide the path the client part of the
secret each time
uh like the face uh features are
submitted to its input so at the end of
the day i say told you we don't store
any private data what we have is that
neural network
uh which is learned to recognize like a
specific individual
and currently so i can log in inside the
wallet with we are completing this
liveness test
and
i'll get inside it so i don't need to
remember anything
no no seed phrase no
qr codes
that's it
apart from that so it's like a classic
wallet
and you can do anything with that like
uh the basic scenes
like receiving sending and that's where
they ever will be integrated soon as
well as the swap and etc functionality
another thing we'll be maybe offering to
the ever engineers future is the bridge
scene we don't understand how the breach
is important currently to be able to
migrate as well to the ever ecosystem
and for this purpose what's also special
about our project is since we are using
this mpc scheme we are able to perform
breach like
almost instantly without the need of
creating
any smart contracts or etc
so in this case all the cryptographic
part will be made of chain and we'll be
able to make a breach from any currency
if you have a liquidity provider of
course instantly with two transactions
so and the like here the cryptography as
well as the off chain like services will
be
like responsible for this kind of things
so apart from that as i told you
previously so we are doing white label
wait label things so currently we've
already launched the
okay that's
yes i want to share my feedback
and that's how the white label
integration might look like
so this what how we integrated with the
wirex team and their product and that's
where the l ever will also occur so what
will we do is uh we will offer as well
as integrate
uh ever to all our current and future
customers
so all of them and their already
existing users will be able to
like to jump in the ever ecosystem and
start using it from like from the start
from their existing products
um
and that's what our product really is
about so
like going to the already
existing products and companies as well
as scripter projects offering their them
white label wallets
as well as gathering all those
uh insane amount of users to the ever
and that's the idea behind it so
currently we are only maybe exploring
like the limited customization things in
terms of functionality and how this uh
the thing you see can be customized
however our end goal is to create like a
fully
uh community open community like
governed and community
developed wallets
with an open source
ecosystem as well as
with
a certain framework of
of
the ui as well as interface so
just to allow all the projects to
develop the ui themselves so we do
understand that our limited team our
team is limited in the amount of
resources as well as in the amount of
the things we might offer in terms of
customization and the features so in the
long run we want to like stick to the
foundation and the core of the wallet
while allowing the community to like
creating the ui they want as well as
adding additional features which our
team is not able to cover within our
roadmap
so that's mainly what i wanted to show
you so if you have any some sort of
questions i would be pleased to answer
absolutely thank you very much vasily
that was a wonderful presentation very
thorough
we do have a question from ivan please
ivan we see your hand but we don't see
you yeah yeah yeah yeah uh the question
is uh where we can read more about your
key splitting algorithm maybe there is
some white paper or patent can you throw
the link in the chat please
yeah i believe we can we can throw that
after
after the after the call after the ema
uh okay yeah um
if possible you can uh send it to me
directly we've we've obviously
communicated in telegram and then i'll
have it
but but if you do have it
you know when we go to the next
presentation just you can toss it to me
or toss it in the
zoom thing you know yeah you can you can
you can sorry you can toss it in our
grand program chat
this is a question from community so
yeah this is not by me just throw it in
grant program chat we have already
please
yes hi thank you i don't think correctly
that that neural neural network which
you uh mentioned which will drive the
user's side um
part of the secret uh
that that neural network operates on
your server
locally
yeah yeah i got it that's an awesome
question in fact
so currently it's uh the neural network
as well as all the biometric part is uh
performed at the third party service
so what we want to do uh and we do
understand the risk there is a certain
risk of a
singular provider
one provider
and for these purposes
this like a subject of another project
of ours
and of our close partners which are
sword so uh in these terms uh what we do
have like in our roadmap
is to create a decentralized network for
that
uh maybe use some sort of
already
existing systems in these terms in order
to make the distribu uh distributed
processing of the biometrics
because when we speak about the storage
of the like of the final neural network
uh so it's not a sensitive data so it
can be stored publicly uh the key
question is here however in terms of
processing so the protestants should be
anonymous and distributed and that's
what we have in our current roadmap and
that's what we are working on so in
order to like to mitigate risks here so
currently it's performed on the side of
a third party
okay and another question uh what the
size and bits of that user side secret
uh that's
uh
i'm not
i do not really remember but it's no
no
it's not it's takes not quite much
amount of data storage capacity if i'm
not mistaken it's around 30 or 32 uh
kilobytes
but i can clarify that
this is it size of secret i mean then i
don't think it's possible to
uh no it's such such long secret uh
for
a face
uh so if you if for example if you do it
second time you should get exactly the
same secret
so i think that the final secret should
be
less than
the amount you set
yeah so uh i was talking maybe uh i got
a bit confused or confused you i was
talking about the neural networks that
we store
uh some of that
neural networks finally generates uh
some user side secret which yeah yeah
device then holds so the question is
what the size of that user side secret
i don't really remember that so it's
more of a tactical question if you want
to i can like provide it within a few
minutes
in the chat
in the like youtube chat just to
only talks about acting not really
familiar with that
yes yeah but you understand the
importance of this question yeah yeah
yeah it depends how many
uh
like
if it is quite small then
you cannot differentiate or you can even
try to
mine
that user side secret in order to try to
process uh transaction
not enough bits then you can i mean your
like
admin
which has has access to a second part of
the secret
uh can try to mine
user by part of the secret
uh yeah yeah i got i got the question
okay i will like
ride in the chat like in a few minutes
the amount of
of the data
the secret consists of
security bits yes
yeah yeah security bits okay
thank you thank you very much we have
another question mita though
yeah hi very interesting uh
great great work i think um is it is it
mpc
uh like um or a two-party computation
uh so yes we have like uh it's snpc but
we have currently only two secrets
so uh scheme we do have plans to like
add
additional cosigners to that so to
increase the amount of signers there
however it's still in role map so
currently it's two
yeah because two-party is a different
protocol as i understand from the
multi-party computation it's actually
not the
of this like it's it's a it's a
different protocol but yeah i understand
if you have two parties here i
understand
um
yeah
the the question of course of the of the
i mean you cannot compute as far as i
understand you cannot compute on the
user device um
because it's just too
like you re it requires too many
resources
so
in the future like how do you really
it's like extension to the pavel's
question i think how do you are you
going to use the server all the time
and just distribute the servers or
how because you cannot compute it on the
on the phone right
or it will take a long time
or or am i missing something
yeah what we also have in plans in these
terms is uh if you speak about the
second secret yeah the ones that start
on the spatium side
we do have plans to use some sort of
like
other networks that will be in
that will be
performing that will perform the
calculations uh in this respect so we
are looking for at like secret network
and etc which will be performing the
decentralized like processing parts so
we will like eliminate the provider sync
so in order to eliminate the risk of the
loss of the second secret of the frozen
like the frozen of the server side we
also have in our roadmap the scroll part
so it's like a guarantor option the one
who will uh like store both
secrets encrypted uh with each other it
can be a custodian one so for instance
if the user or like
wants to like leave the system you can
grab the second secret uh from the
custodianship and like restore the
private key with that
uh so in fact that's
the questions you that you're asking are
quite the ones that we want to address
and are seeking to address
in the long run uh i believe
here i would be pleased that we have
like guys from a tech team to answer
them like in depth because i'm more
about about the product rather than the
tech side
of the protocol don't make
want to make your life harder sorry
but um yeah it's an interesting it's an
interesting stuff and uh
like if you can
make it work uh
then like it would be great
i i just didn't see
up until now any successful
implementation of mpcs like on the user
devices
without involvement of some kind of
custodian and servers and
all of that and you know
in fact what we had in like in our early
stage
uh first of all when spatial was created
we do not have we do not have like a
server component
we had two devices
so we were using like two devices to
perform like a signature so we still had
the smpc there
however one secret was located for
instance one my mobile phone and the
other was on for instance the
apple watch
so and i was like co-signing the
transaction
uh like off-chain completely uh even
without the internet since for instance
apple watch can be used without the
internet just with via bluetooth
connection it was like a very secure
option how we decided to go away from
this concept since it was not like um
very sustainable for
for from the business point of view
because it's hard to monetize the
completely off chain sync without like
the service part of the component and
it's not really the scheme that for
instance the services want to
so the idea that we stick to the server
was greatly because uh we see that there
is a majority of users which is not like
99 of people who are familiar with the
banking experience
and they want like um a strong security
party that will that will assist them in
terms of like managing the crypto scene
which is
quite hard for them and that's why this
ability from one side to be independent
since once the secret is stored for
instance on my mobile device and the
band cannot do a thing with my crypto
and that's important
uh and from the other side we have a
bank who co-signs the transactions who
can perform emails for instance as well
as all other things and that's that's
what we think important here uh we as
i've told you yes we do had an option to
create a fully uh client-side snpc with
two devices however
that's
that's what we decided not to do
or for the business and like in the long
run
racing
all right
thank you
yup i i um uh i have so many things
going on in my head right now um i i
expected this to be a lot simpler but it
turned out like i said we have the gold
standard of presentations today i think
we just moved up to platinum that was
wonderful thank you very interesting
very interesting i think you're going to
have a lot of questions
sorry sorry raise your hand but okay
uh
raising your hand just for the protocol
and um the question from community is
you just dropped out
just just happened in my private
messages so the question is
uh what is the difference between
two of two multisig and your solution
if you speak about multi-signature uh as
classic one and the scheme we use so if
you speak about multisig all the
calculations are performed on chain
so it's a matter of additional costs in
terms of fees and etc
if we speak about the
uh
our scheme of uh
using the smtc scene
so the calculations are performed
off-chain
so there is no need so it's like a
cryptography based one so we don't no
need to perform any any
any transactions on chain in order to
sign a transaction from our product
so the server and mobile device are
exchanged like via internet with via all
the data in group by to make a signature
for the transaction and that's it so so
from from the side of blockchain our
transactions
is seen as an regular one signed by the
private key by a single private key
okay
thank you very much we have to move to
our next presentation obviously we're
running overtime
yes thank you guys yeah i thought we'd
actually have two more presentations
today you imagine that but uh vasily
that was
cool
very cool
okay next up we have game pay uh so i'm
going to read exactly what they do so
they provide a play to er they provide
play to earn tools
and infrastructure to create game meta
versions
for low and middle uh revenue game
creators and gamers and joanne had to
leave but i can tell you right now if
she was here she'd probably be
salivating so
uh we have uh daniel dos santos daniel
dos santos or daniel santos so forgive
me if
oh hey thanks for the uh uh warm
introduction yeah uh you can call me
daniel santos daniel de santos daniel
dan what have you i've been called much
worse uh but yeah
daniel's the ceo of uh gamepay uh so
i've been looking forward to this all
day so please the floor is yours
please tell me hey thank you so i i was
told to put my camera on unless i'm
naked uh i'm not actually naked but i'm
actually
it's a joke it's a joke that's a joke
but i'm actually by the bay in marina in
marina bay here in singapore because
it's 10 p.m so just taking a walk
so that that's my view currently that's
my view there oh and what a view it is i
love it
yeah so yeah so uh to take a step back
and uh just to explain my own words so
yeah gameplay we provide infrastructure
tools and communities for a game
developers to
launch games
play-to-own games in our platform we
provide libraries
infrastructure tools everything that
allows them to to launch games in our
platform
uh we we are focusing that our target
demographic is low
to low income to
mid-income demographic in um
in southeast asia but you know across
emerging markets uh across the world but
you know our targets mostly uh in
southeast asia
emerging markets
and we see a big opportunity because
this target demographic is untapped
they've been overlooked
by game developers and they've been
priced out of the markets
in current play to earn games so they
cannot afford to play x infinity games
etc they're being priced out so there's
one untapped market so we are making it
accessible affordable for for the target
demographic to access
uh to access the token economy the new
token economy and we see the tokenized
gig economy with gaming being part of
that vertical of the tokenized gig
economy as a big opportunity
we
we're gonna have a multitude of games
launching up in our platform
we have our own nft marketplace that my
colleague ezra is going to present to
you guys a little bit later but he's
still in uat
and we we have our own decks
and we're creating our game art
uh with utility that is translated into
nfts
uh so in a process of of creating all of
this and uh you guys
are gonna see what we have created in
about a month from now we're gonna show
you you know the live nfc marketplace
our nfc our nfcs
in about a month from now uh we're gonna
have
our game uh launched
as a series of mvps
and we we just
upgraded our game development
development partner
to a company in london but most of that
developers are
based in ukraine
so you know we
uh we're being a little bit delayed on
that because they've been
evacuating from ukraine et cetera but
you know uh we are donating part of our
preseason or nfc cell to the red cross
in ukraine so we we we recognize the
good cause because a lot of our
developers are now
uh based or they're from ukraine uh and
um
yeah so so that's that's basically the
overview and uh we are a baby we came
out of the belly back in november but we
have baby on asteroids we're growing
very fast uh but you know we we came out
of the valley back in november so we're
pretty new but we're developing
extremely fast
and um you know we we are very fortunate
to have won the um everscale grant
and uh you know it was a very thorough
process uh you know we we have we do
have some big investors on our side uh
including um
capital which is uh uh backed by a
multi-billionaire that set up the saxo
bank and he's chairman of a
concordia blockchain and we have a
partnership of concordium on the id
verification layer side of things
and we have another institutional
investor which is ai in singapore and
their listed company here in singapore
so we do have some
big institutional investors backing us
and uh we we're we're developing our
tech very fast
uh and uh you know but we are not ready
yet so we're a little baby uh so a lot
of our staff is still in uh still
cooking but uh you know
saying that
we can show you what we have on our uat
and i'll pass the button out to our cto
ezra who's on a call
yes ezra please go ahead and and if i
may ask uh for after you're done with
your presentation there's a few
questions that actually did come uh
come in uh they're written to us and
also on youtube so if if you're able to
stick around post facto would be great
um so that's right
with pleasure
hey hi
uh thanks uh ron and thanks dan for um
you know quick uh
and clear introduction so um
yeah as dan mentioned right so
uh this is a platform we are developing
and
there's also you know um condensation of
all the experiences all the products we
have developed in the past 20 25 years
for the banks so if you see our profile
like we have
we have like more than two decades of
experience in technology developing
financial products for the bank
so personally myself i have experience
with uh jp morgan
standard chartered lehman brothers
and the past i was working with dbs
doing some um
you know the stable coins within the uh
bank
so
uh so we wanted to put together all this
experience and um you know make gameplay
and of course you know you all know why
we want to go into game and
i know why you want to go into energy
space
so game is actually our passion and
we have a
lot of financial experience so we want
to combine the game and the duffy and
make it more attractive because we
really love the new paradigm which is uh
you know later on so in the past we all
you know wanted to kill some time and
have fun so we played games
um but now uh in the next generation you
know people are really you know playing
to earn so
it's going to be a huge big economy as
we go forward so we really want to
leverage it so that's the reason why we
wanted to go so even you know going into
this market we don't want to go as
developing a single game uh we wanted to
go in as a platform like how you know
amazon google
netflix they established themselves as a
you know a platform and
they they made you know the others grow
in it like like aws or google for
example right so we wanted to develop
those
libraries those uh you know ecosystems
which can be used by the indie
developers game developers and game
studio to embark into the web 3.0
journey so so we we were
backed by intensive research
both in the
finance angle as well as in the gaming
angle we found
having infrastructure is the key because
um
this is something which we will need in
the upcoming years uh as everybody you
know starts to move into the gaming and
whatever's world so that's that actually
kind of uh adds more into our passion
right so
with that i'll quickly share
what we have done we have progressed so
far yes
so
okay so i won't go here
for now this is a new version which we
are you know building now uh so this is
the first version of uh
uh you know marketplace nft marketplace
which we have built this is very close
to the you know the axi infinity which
is our competitor um so this is just you
know um you
log into your account
with your wallet we actually we are
going into binance to start with and we
do support
the multi-chain so javascale is our you
know next uh in the queue in the
pipeline to implement for uh supporting
multi-chain so right now what you're
seeing is um is in binance
so this is admin version uh for the user
for the player
they will see the
dashboard they can go and you know
choose the chicks which they wanted to
buy and then you know they can buy so
so right now
we are supporting both uh you know
because it's just nft and we are
aligning it for pre-sale and pre-sale of
nfp is still okay to support uh you know
fiat feared money so we are going to
support both
you know payment by credit card as well
as by wallets so that's how you know
this will go and um
so each and every characters whatever
the transaction we make here that will
be useful used inside the game for both
playing the game as well as to
accommodate the defeat angle so um maybe
definitely
i can show in the upcoming sessions
because there is a
massive revamping happening as you guys
saw
the whole ui ux is getting changed uh as
the number of uh you know use cases are
changing and also we want to make it
more attractive for the
for the nft pre-sale so the kind of we
are combining um
the nft marketplace uh for the game as
well as uh you know for the referral as
well as for the for the defiance so
that's why uh this whole thing is uh
getting revamped at the moment but uh
functionally it will be the same we are
also supporting dex a single uh ammo
decks uh just to you know uh convert
from uh the other crypto to our own
cheeky or silk token so these two are
you know so i'm just showing it here in
the dev and uit version but
in the real production world
we may not expose this directly as a dex
interface because we have not opened it
as a defi yet
but
internally the apis will be supporting
uh to do this conversion for the for the
gamers that's how the whole thing will
be working end-to-end and creating nft
is uh again this is admin uh account so
i'm just showing like uh how easy it
will be for the people to go and create
so eventually um for the game
perspective it is um
it's mostly you know you go and uh
inside the game you can do an option of
breeding and you will be able to
generate a new enft that's how the whole
thing will be coming and
uh if you see the filters all these are
attributing towards the game play
specifically so
we have you know um classes uh like
uh and it is evolving so we have
currently nine classes and um we are we
are actually evolving our game play to
support 15 classes so that the nfps can
be you know minted more and there will
be more variation in the games and color
is straightforward and gender is
something because it's quite related to
the chick uh cheeky cheek
we wanted to introduce this flavor of
male and female so a rooster and a hen
so it makes you know the adventure and
pvp game more interesting with you know
chick fights
special tournament for
the rooster fights and there are more
interesting stuff
that will be unlocked enough
for those who bought those you know
special characters in the pre-sale
so
yeah and then uh added upon with body
parts so body parts or accessories um
there are a few more i mean there are
high quality checks these are all just
sample images so please don't get
pre uh
preconceive your thing with characters
here these are all test
[Music]
images but there are high quality
you know close to 3d quality
nfc images are getting built
so those will have
a body part which will be
you know replaceable and then according
to the gaming uh you know stages or
gameplay it can be
you know swappable to
tackle the villains so that's how these
body parts will be attaching to the
chick to play and the game plays itself
is more interesting and the graphics are
you know more uh um you know user user
friendly so you feel like you know you
wanted to play more and have some
you know
fun as you play along and then have a
chance to win money as well so breed
count is again this is a there is a
limitation to the number of times we can
breed with the chicks we have um so so
based on the number of uh reading it has
been done the the number will be you
know updated accordingly there are a few
more um attributes we're trying to add
uh this is just a sample in the uat
environment but there are a few more
coming up to make things more
interesting uh like special power like
something like you know a james bond
character something like mermaid
character so if you have uh those kind
of uh nfps in your wallet then you will
have uh you know different uh
perspective to your game right so if you
have a
mermaid then you you will have a uh a
sea
uh water kind of uh environment where
you are uh you know fighting or your
game play will be tuned accordingly so
uh so the whole game dynamics the game
uh background things are all you know uh
dynamic made dynamic with the nfps that
you are going to hold in your wallet so
that's how we have designed and this is
just
a very uh you know preliminary
software which we have we are releasing
it opening it up so uh it is it will be
more interesting to see you know how
this whole thing is
developed this whole thing is developed
as a library so
uh in the future so marketplace backs
and uh the defi elements they are all
getting built in in the library so
if any other new game they wants to
board with us they can just you know use
that with few configurations and they
will have the whole uh you know software
available so it will be purely like an
aws where you go and you know click on
your infrastructure what you want like
you know ec2 or
kubernetes or you know whatever um
services you want you plug and play and
then subscribe then you will have all
these things set up for you neatly and
you focus on only the game story
gameplay and the unity or any other
gaming you know
framework you're going to use so even on
the on the gaming side we are making
certain libraries that will be
useful for interfacing with the
blockchain area uh our blockchain
library so
it will be totally agnostic to the game
developers
and then you know they can easily
onboard as many games as possible
so
actually i yeah we are still uh maybe
maybe i i actually i was like not quite
organized for this call because i was
pulled in last minute i had
uh you know different calls and i still
have to go for another architecture
review session so maybe um in the
upcoming sessions i can go a little deep
into the um you know the architecture
part how the
the library is differentiated uh in a
modular way so that uh those solidity
which we wrote for
uh binance chain um
you know ethereum all those things can
be reused for evm based chain and then
how we are you know
differentiating
or making it uh more modular for ever
skill so that it is all interoperable uh
only areas which is specific to the
underlying chain will be uh you know um
called by those specific apis and the
whole game will function without uh you
know having any knowledge about the
underlying chain it is in so that's the
whole uh idea that's the crux of uh you
know where we are uh still a lot of
things are
in pipeline for this month so we work in
a completely agile
environment so there is a two-week
sprint and every two weeks we have
something getting added so in the next
two weeks you will see
uh our whole marketplace will be
upgraded to the new
newer version that's happening now and
then on the gaming side we are um you
know we are releasing uh the first four
characters those special you know ultra
rare uh characters will be launched by
end of this month and then uh as dan
mentioned uh our um you know ukrainian
colleagues
will be working on getting the the first
version of the game uh you know in a
sprint sprint cycle once they're ready
so that's our overall plan and that's
how we are progressing in achieving our
goal so within the uh four to five
sprints we will be in a very good
position to
uh launch it to public so pre-sale will
be launching much much earlier probably
in next two to three sprints and then uh
you know something for people to go and
play around in in five sprints that's
our overall plan
and just to add to that so in terms of
ip in our first game so we are
developing we developed our own uh
gameplay so that's first part of the ip
and then secondly we have a team of
artists uh in-house that we developed uh
stories for and characters that were
turned into nfcs and they may actually
become you know movie movie uh series uh
later on
uh so that's the ap on our first game
but essentially we are open platform uh
to allow game developers to launch in
our platform
uh so that's basically the overview and
then you know we want to make it
accessible so we don't want to provide
entry-level prices for guys and girls in
emerging markets to always be able to
afford to enter the new token economy
and in terms of our community
again we're still a baby uh we came out
of the valley in november so things are
still very new
we do have support community support
because of who we are what we're
building
and who's backing us so we do have
community support so if you go to
telegram if you go to our community
you're going to see community support
that but you know we're still very new
uh this is a few months old three months
old uh community and we're going to be
much more active once
we have our nfc marketplace once we have
nfts in the market once we have our
games
in the market you're going to see a lot
more activity so things are still very
new so we need to follow a cycle
thank you uh daniel thank you very much
if i may uh thank you for the
presentation ezra daniel uh much
appreciated um please stick around um
there are several questions that came in
um but um
right off the bat i'm actually getting
this live as we're talking uh there's a
question coming in asking how is this
tied to everscale
so so in regard regards to everscale we
love everscale because of its
scalability
so we need the scalability for our games
using everscale
and you know there's a lot of
synergistic opportunities because we
provide access to asia to uh to have a
scale so we give our asian community to
our scale
and you know we can develop uh great
things together going forward but this
scalability of every scale that's one of
the most attractive things for us and
also you know our locality we have
developers in ukraine and eastern europe
in russia a lot of our investors are
actually in in that location russia
ukraine
and so we are marrying asia
and uh you know and russia ukraine uh
locations
uh and communities and uh we see a lot
of synergistic opportunities but one one
word scalability
okay
um
you have a question yeah do we have
something already developed on every
scale part of part of the system
or whatever no
no this is a very young uh relationship
so we ourselves as a company we only uh
you know we're gonna be four months old
uh next you know in a few in a few days
but you know we are still very young so
development with other scales coming in
a pipeline
so what was the grant from everscale
from ford
uh the grant from everscale was to
develop uh product is basically what i
said earlier to develop products
together to to develop games whatnot
whatever you use data never using
scalability
uh
maybe uh ron so we got the grant just
recently right so we already
had a clear roadmap uh you know given
that we will be able to start only after
the first uh you know the game is
launched which is like maybe you know
two to three sprints away
so the current uh team is focusing on um
getting the current uh you know pipeline
out we are also um expanding our team um
so once the current uh you know sprints
are done then we will start uh
full-blown with our skill so
yeah
that's a time period we already
communicated clearly yeah yeah i
understand that i think um i'm reading
some of the questions that are out there
so um
you know uh don't mind me uh but uh
everscale you know it's not a
i mean the grand program is for the
benefit of everscale
you know so
i'll read some of the questions yeah so
so i mean uh i'm sure every scale knows
why
he gave her he gave us a grant and uh
you know we know why it's basically to
develop games together using everscale
infrastructure for scalability
okay
so we don't have anything built on
everscale yet because we're very new
we're only four months old i understand
i understand um so um so i'm going to
read some questions that were written
into us understand work i mean there's
there's
well over 100 000 people in the
community but uh on this call we always
always
uh
read every question um so uh and some of
these might be a little uncomfortable so
please just uh bear with me um so the
question is in five parts i'm going to
skip over uh the repetitive parts but
there's uh why was gam gamepay allocated
250 000 dollars worth um they have
social networks that have many bots and
fake users i'm just reading what's
what's being
written to me
the second part is
uh where did those
who allocated token okay that that's
i'm not gonna i'll skip that
um
is there
uh
it looks like uh someone basically
uh
it looks as if someone of their own i
think this gentleman or lady is uh
has poor english but i think what
they're trying to convey is that it
looks like
someone
provided tokens inside a closed group uh
how is that different from any previous
partnerships with overscale
why do we allocate 250 000 for a grant
but cannot allocate the same amount for
listing on an exchange for instance
traders will come from the exchange and
there will be more liquidity in the
network
um
so that's like three parts of one
question i guess essentially they're
asking
the people are asking they don't
understand what the benefits to the
network is that's
i'm reading
and paraphrasing
but you know like i said he's not clear
now to the community because he's very
new so the the the building is gonna
come you know as we said after the game
is launched and we provide
infrastructure for developers to launch
games on our platform and you know the
scalability
understood daniel thank you daniel thank
you ezra uh
understand we're an open community
decentralized anybody can ask anything
they want and it's my responsibility to
ask any question that's posed so yeah
regarding regarding the comment about
community and the fake uses and blocks
again
we cannot control
the whole community in every social
media that we have
so we do we do kick out bots as much as
possible
we do kick out fake users as much as
possible but we cannot fully control
the number of bots that may actually you
know go through the cracks
uh but we do have a genuine growing
community so if uh if if um we're
getting comments about you know are we
fake
uh obviously we are not fake we have
just look at the team that we have our
backers and yeah just go into our
channels and start engaging with members
of the telegram community and you see
that you know we do have um you know
genuine
engagement and genuine users and again
look at the team who we are our
background look at what we're building
what has been presented here on the call
and you know who is backing us and you
know that that should give comfort to
the community that we are real i think
what happens is because there's so many
scams so many bad projects and bad
actors
uh everyone becomes not everyone but
there's a certain number of community
members that become negative so they ask
you they look for you know they look for
the negatives uh but you know let's not
focus on negatives uh not every project
is a scam let's focus on the positives
and on the good projects and back good
teams because to be negative
uh and to throw eggs at the projects and
i don't think that's um productive
absolutely you're correct and and but
that's kind of the beauty of a real
decentralized community and a blockchain
is that
everybody has an opinion you know i i
there's a quote that americans have that
i'm not going to voice here but um you
know um
everybody's got an opinion but it's our
responsibility to make sure their voices
are heard so i had to ask those
uncomfortable questions and i hope you
appreciate that
yeah we appreciate it but at the same
time we cannot uh taste every comment
either in the community because if
there's like a hundred thousand
community members we cannot chase uh
every single uh comments but you know we
we're here to address the main comments
absolutely absolutely daniel thank you
daniel thank you ezra um
wonderful presentation
i'm sure there's going to be a lot of
chat in the community and we're going to
we're going to
move forward
so uh thank you
absolutely thank you for coming um we do
have
so we have uh some questions that were
written in uh youtube folks i'll get to
you in a minute
uh
for the surf folks so
so the first is uh when's when is surf
going to be open sourced
who wants to tackle that uh mita
anton
is an still with us
who wants to who wants to yeah um yeah
maybe i'll answer a squishy but uh sort
of uh our stuff um
wouldn't be open
uh yet uh we'll open the browser as we
just said with the voice part but uh so
we we have plans to do it but this work
is not open source project
there are parts of servers that are
already open sourced a ui kit is open
source sdk and which surface work in an
open source and yes as android says that
the browser will be
that are the nearest place
so we are still
thinking
and going to open sources but not
environment
because
lots and lots
thank you thank you anne
um next question
again this is one of those uncomfortable
ones uh why launch a surf token sale if
there isn't much liquidity on the
network uh chess nft tried to sell their
token on the network without any success
well let's see
because
we have
um
already so there are messages
from people in the schools
i think i convert i can i can personally
say um that i think it's uh
it's an unfair comparison
uh because the surf product is um you
know
it's two different things uh i don't
know why um
why it has to be compared one-to-one um
an nft project in the surf token sale i
think surf is uh
done an amazing job
you know i
i personally put my own tokens my own
money into surf so i
you have my vote you have my money so if
anybody respects my opinion they
probably say let's do this um we have uh
um is there any information from okay
this is not the serve team this is a
general question any information from
funds can we focus on this
um what do you mean any information from
funds like investors yeah there are
plenty coming or if if that is to the
surf team um
are there any and is there any
information on funds that are going to
be uh directed towards surf i know i'm
personally working on that so
uh i'm not gonna give any specifics uh
but uh i'm certainly trying to get some
um some funds into the surf project i
mean if that answers your question
if anybody else wants to add anything to
that
um
if not that's it for written questions
let's go to youtube
um
right
so
uh
there was a question asked and the
question was answered um it wasn't
retracted so let me read uh somebody
says i'm concerned about the facial
features in terms of
collisions i think collusions maybe he
meant any data regarding say twins or so
so this is a facial recognition question
question this is for spacium
so if you try to get too much too many
bits from the facial features it could
be
not that constant
along some person's life and if you take
take too little
about a bits
from face
can be not secure
okay um
and then it was answered so we're not
really extracting the secret from the
user's biometrics we instead teach nnn
to provide the previously generated
secret each time certain uh face
features are submitted to it but um
i i think the question and the answer
they sort of canceled each other out i
could say that i actually worked in a
facial recognition company uh there's
another gentleman who's part of the
everex team who has as well and we're
actually going to study this a little
bit because it's very interesting to me
as somebody who who comes from that
sector
this is
potentially really cool it raises a lot
of very interesting questions
uh questions we never faced like um
private biometrics like uh privacy and
biometrics it's uh
that's a whole industry unto itself but
we'll we're going to look into this um
i'm going to have questions myself
so hopefully we're past the youtube
portion of that a gentleman
asks
doesn't make any sense that the whole
telegram community thing they have 50
views on posts and 25 000 followers
who's they who are you referring to um
is it okay
so game pay guys ezra um that's the
doesn't make any sense that the whole
telegram community thing they they have
50 views on posts and 25 000 followers
did you want to address that at all
uh yeah so we have another heckler
another heckler on the go yeah so we
have over 30 000 uh members on a
telegram
and i will invite whoever wants to to
join our telegram group and engage with
the members
uh i mean to us it makes sense that we
have the numbers of uh
you know
users or you know
engaged in the telegram so we make the
numbers make sense to us but whoever um
whomever
doesn't think so just join our group and
engage with the users
thank you so there's your answer uh so
go to the group engage with the users
and and see
we have one last question on youtube uh
who do you think your competitor is and
why
and again i believe that's probably
to you daniel um and ezra what do you
think your competitors and why
yes
our main competitor
currently is axe infinity
but uh they they've been a victim of
their own success so now uh
people in emerging markets in southeast
asia would be priced out of using axi so
that's why we fill in the gap
uh because you know users being priced
out and there are some flaws in a token
economic economics that we don't have we
have a more sustainable model but axis
is our main competitor
okay
i hope that answers your question um
thank you everybody very much does
anyone have any more questions for the
presenters and and today was a very
interesting call we put everybody on the
spot but um uh with all due respect to
everybody that came this is what we do
right um we we
