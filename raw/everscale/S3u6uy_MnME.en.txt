[Applause]
and i can't believe you guys are still
wearing this stuff what is this
i'm on a ferry at the moment my friends
so uh here we go
i don't know if you can see
heading over to france to meet some uh
very very exciting people uh working in
the industry so hopefully i might have
some good news for you all next week you
never know touchwood
hey hey
all right well
i think
i mean people pile in as we go but um
yeah so
i'm gonna start so
hi everybody uh welcome to everscale
community call number 99
thank you for joining us uh today we
have a lot to get through um so i'm not
gonna waste a lot of time i'm gonna go
through the call etiquette very quickly
uh please turn your cameras on uh please
save your questions until each presenter
is finished please raise your hand and
zoom to ask a question and if you're on
youtube please write your question in
the comments section we'll get it to get
to it at the very end of the call
this was not part of the agenda uh at
least on on paper uh but i have i'm
going to start today i have a little bit
of an announcement to make if you will
um
if you recall
back in
september
we passed a proposal called growth phase
which among many many other things
locked tokens for global governance
until the growth phase was to be
complete and i'm going to quote the
proposal and say that it said about one
year so give or take
uh
the
last uh vesta tokens that were received
by global governance were
in may of 2021 i believe
which puts us right
into
the
november time frame for them to be
unlocked now
the time has come
for growth
phase three
okay
uh
platon
runs
one of our most stellar
analytics and bi teams who have done a
tremendous amount of research a
tremendous amount of intel
on who
received tokens from the community
and has come up with
two proposals
both of which are going to be voted on
today
and
they're going to be voted on through
ever doubt
not by global governance which is a
major major milestone
one is for initial members the other is
for partners so
the one
for initial members is essentially going
to provide a summary
of what each member has done throughout
their tenure uh with everscale
and based on that summary or those
summaries if you will
again through ever dow
we are going to have votes on a weekly
basis in batches
the reason for the batches is because
it's logistically and operationally
impossible to really do it all at once
on whose tokens
should be unlocked once the growth phase
is complete and i want to underscore
that once the growth phase is complete
the other one is for partners
very similar uh concept but a little
different in uh
structure
here
each partner uh will be asked well we're
gonna provide the analytics on each
partner they already exist but it'll be
just a little bit more formal uh with a
chance for each partner to respond
to those analytics
and based on that
every partner that has brought
significant value to the network has
done what they said
uh and uh
is basically considered to be
valuable uh for lack of a better term uh
will of course continue to be supported
by overscale
uh those that have not
will be terminated
um in the end uh i guess what we're
doing is we're striving
to retain
everybody that has committed themselves
done the work believes in the ecosystem
uh believes in the network
and uh provides value to it those who
haven't
they haven't
uh
essentially what i'm trying to say i
guess is uh we heard you
right
there's been a lot of chatter and the
chats
most certainly a lot of chatter in the
forums
some directed to me personally
happens
uh again
we
heard you
so the bottom line is the community
decides
so
we're going to decide uh it's not going
to be easy
it's not going to be fast
this is a very very complicated process
especially when it comes to partners
because frankly there's just so many of
them and we owe them
a thorough analysis we owe them a
thorough
uh
background of everything that we have
and we also owe them the opportunity to
respond that's the way business is done
but in the end
we're doing it
starting today
so
that's about it
for
for me for my announcements uh
any questions
i would have figured there'd been a
million questions but we'll see what
happens on youtube if we don't have any
questions i think everybody is just
shocked wrong by what you said so if
people are digesting
okay well digest it um i i don't think
shocked is the right word i think uh
most of the community should be pretty
happy about this positive that's exactly
what i meant yeah
this is what what you've been asking for
and uh we
respond to what you do
to what you want because that's uh
because it's not up to us it's up to you
so
hopefully that's good news um but of
course the work
will be the work and i can see how much
work is ahead of us so um anyway
it's gonna be done and it's gonna be
done forever now all right uh that's it
for me let's go to presentations of
first as always
technical updates meet her
please go ahead
hi
uh
uh technical update so we we have um
like as like i said
um
we have like updated the devnet with uh
with
like patch which solves the problem with
the big accounts
but
during that update
we have realized that
because of some
bug that was presented
um long ago and nobody really could
catch it because it was like an obscure
branch
which we never touched
in code and this
account
kind of
revealed that back i would say
it wasn't really critical but
we couldn't
update because of that
and um so we had to
like resync like resync the database
basically
um
okay everything was fixed and everything
is great
the only problem is that we cannot
really re-sync the database like that on
the main net because it involves too
much coordination
so instead of doing this we
we're preparing the patch now which
which will basically
update
the corrupted
cells in the database
by itself
and that patch
will go out this week so we're testing
that and this patch will also introduce
some other
interesting stuff that was not
part of the patch that we have released
last time
and that's include the compression which
a lot of people were asking about so the
compression is here it will be
introduced this week uh to the network
and uh
you know so yeah so many people have
asked about that and yeah
but the incompatibility with c plus plus
not is already there uh anyway and not
only about because of compression
there is an announcement that is going
to be released today
about the breaking changes in
because we introduced several new
instructions as you know including my
code that they need
to the tdm
that uh subsequently
leads to a led to the
changes in account
structure
so the tlbs him describing this will be
released and
it is a breaking change so in order we
will we will have like a gracial
kind of um
roll out so basically we'll roll out but
the sdk you need to update the sdk
to the latest version and the sdk
version will for some time support both
accounts
so you can migrate your applications
that also breaks
any other front-end solutions
that has been introduced
to the network
so
whoever is doing this
solutions and they know broxas has one
will need to
upgrade
their
their code
to support this new account structures
so new account structure basically
so um
and yeah and uh and uh the announce
about that is going out today and you
have some time to do that but not a lot
um before like the capability will be
turned on
on the main network and
in this instructions will kick
on
is the only instruction that is not yet
released that we're planning to is uh is
um
copyleft instruction which is very
important one
and um we will we're testing that now
probably will be in the next release
so this week only that
and we will turn on compression
um some other
smaller things which i don't want to
mention now and um
can this instruction set up great and
breaking changes to the account so
that's really
that's really all from me thank you
any questions
there is one question meteor from ivan
yeah i do have one
uh
let me just one second
uh yeah so
the the question is about uh the
compression so
uh
we know that as for now there are
certain limits on the gps you know my
net and we know that compression will
remove this limits for some extent
so the question is to what extent so
what what will be the new limits on tps
on the mainland
i don't know about limits on on tps
there are some mechanisms that are
preventing you to go over certain
limits but
it it was done for the compatibility
mode and um there is there is
like the biggest limit is the gas
limit on the block and the gas limit on
the block will remain like that for some
time
okay so so the compression the
compression will make it
no the compression
does does something right uh of course
making less traffic by a lot
uh
but um but in terms of uh we are not
optimizing for tps now into you need to
kind of we are not we don't see the
necessity for
right now the speeding up the tps this
is not our concern our concern right now
is safely introduce all the changes that
we need to introduce
including the new algorithms like ramp
the new protocols like cramped and new
algorithms like new consensus algorithm
so then to make it in the safely fashion
um on the main net and that take it will
take some time and before we go through
that before we are through that we are
not going to
again if tomorrow some application real
application not like some
spammy contract real application comes
and says like flex for example we're
launching flex and suddenly we see 100
000 people trading like crazy monkeys
with the automatic cradle algorithms
blah blah blah and we need 10 000 ktps
well once it happens
we will deal with that and maybe
switching priority right now the
priority is to
to
uh switch to the new protocols that are
enabling
the unlimited tps basically
and with also with the necessary
security so before we so i hope
there won't be any
necessity to
change that path that we're on right now
in implementing the roadmap and go and
start to you know
suddenly deal with 10 000 tps tomorrow
but if it happens well we will deal with
that
okay thank you
uh
a small question about uh your
expectations on when we are going to
introduce the ramp and the new consensus
should we wait for for example middle of
summer or end of summer or will it be
faster how do you see
well ramp isn't testing now internal
internal dates for release of ramp is
may
um but you know
that is something
you know if everything just goes kind of
smooth and we don't see a huge amount of
bugs uncovering themselves in the next
two three weeks on the test
okay so the answer is basically soon
well what do you want
longer
later coin by the way can be
like the next big idea
yeah so the there are some reasons why
i'm asking that i'm not just uh came
here and asking that because i want to
ask there are some reasons but yeah we
are ready to wait
well again the the ramp is implemented
it's in testing that's a very
complicated protocol
you need to understand ramp is really
complicated protocol it's the most
complicated protocol that is in the
network right now it's more complicated
than cat chain it's more complicated
than than consensus it's more
complicated than anything that has been
introduced up so far
so it's a really complicated piece of
fake way whatever
and uh and
and we it's a lot of things
you know happening
the bugs that
certain you know
implementation issues and stuff like
that so yeah
but in the the another problem with rem
is that ram cannot be introduced
gradually
we cannot have both
old
external messages can damp
simultaneously on the same network we
cannot do that
so ramp is a switch
on off kind of switch so once we move to
ramp there is no
no kind of well we can roll back of
course but that's that's all we can and
we don't obviously want to do that so
that's that additional kind of
constraint of how
well we should test rim before we
introduce it let's be tested really well
okay thank you mita very much um we
actually have uh we have to go to our
next presenter right away because there
are some technical issues on on his end
and uh if we don't hurry up he might get
cut off so i apologize thank you michael
very much thank you for your question
ivan uh next we have uh vlad from
brock's with us uh he's gonna talk about
several updates including universal
bridge uh the latest on cube and yield
farming so glad you're up yeah hi guys
so sorry for interrupting but okay
really there is a whole electricity
shutdown in all the streets and uh my
battery will leave maybe for 20 minutes
then i will have to switch to my cell
phone uh okay so uh to make a long story
short so i actually have two updates for
today um
so i will show it to you uh now
uh so first one is uh what uh is called
the universal bridge so but before doing
this so um i won't just say that we now
have a very beautiful landing pages that
we are proud of so it was a really
really uh whole process to collect all
the info and uh test against different
stakeholders so but finally we have it
yeah a small
internal wing i hope you love it
uh so actually what uh let me tell you
about the universal bridge because it's
something really huge
that was uh
launched it it doesn't seem to be like
this but believe me it is really a game
changer for
many many businesses
oh
what was that sounded like a
i don't want to say
yes
so and uh for all the businesses uh
that are running cross chain so and um
what actually it does
is that uh it allows you to transfer uh
any token uh
without whitelisting it in the bridge so
that's that's easy so you just need to
import the token and uh
then you go so you can transfer it to to
everscale
and from fsk by the way to other
networks as well so we do not support
the hidden bridge for universal breach
yet meaning that you
for now cannot uh move talking directly
from for example ethereum to polygon
the one that is not quite listed but we
are working on that so and it will
appear soon but maybe let me show you
how it works so uh let's choose any
chain oh maybe let's do it better so uh
let's take any token from uh coin market
cap so anything that's uh on
the ethereum mainnet on binance marching
my net so for example this in gene coin
so copy address
so as it is on the ethereum so we select
ethereum here
yeah so uh i change my network
done
uh now i select everscale and put next
uh
this it's that's easiest i just need to
input the token address here you see
it's automatically dragged the name from
the token contract and click import so
that's it now i can try and transfer
engine token to
have a scale so it will get here
having the prefix uh oct meaning the
octus so it will be like oct uh eng
enj
just to distinguish it with the original
token however the guys are currently
working on the matching uh
mechanism meaning that for example if uh
any business has its tokens already in
several networks so uh it can contact us
and say hey guys so here are our
contracts in different networks and we
will introduce it matching uh on uh have
a scale uh letting it easily go through
the hidden bridge
uh so i hope it will appear soon
also uh we will be announcing shortly
the contest for
video makers uh on the universal bridge
explanation uh
in different languages so just keep a
track on our social groups and our news
channels
uh so it's we will be uh just giving
away quite quite an amount of bridge
tokens uh for creating those videos so
please participate and spread the word
so the more uh explanatory videos we
have in different countries in different
languages the batteries for the whole
network
uh and also we have just finished the
contest for the
bridge documentation so we decided um to
run an experiment when we give uh
the task for running the user
documentation to the community and the
hell it's run really well so and
we are really happy about the results
and congrats to winners who who already
i financially got the the
rewards so and we plan to continue such
activities uh in future so just again
keep subscribed to our groups and social
media
so the second news is about the uh flat
cube and it's talking cube so uh all of
you may have seen that we have
successfully successfully finished the
campaign
uh on
the everstart launchpad so and we have
put there uh
some amount of cube tokens uh to see the
interest in those tokens and how how the
community is involved and how they're
expecting the things we are doing and uh
well it's run extremely well so we
uh
collected five times more than uh it was
uh
announced as a hard cap
and
of course uh
we have took only
the hard cap and then we
uh ritually burned it uh just to show
that uh this was a really marketing
campaign and nothing else it was not in
token sale or anything of this kind but
the uh happy we had the participants of
the launch pad will be getting uh
the
the tokens according to the veterans
so
i will share with you now the
few ideas about what cube token is
because
many of you have asked this question and
so uh here's the one pager of
um
uh of the cube token so actually uh
what cube is uh going to
to introduce on flat cube is a really
big set of new mechanics that are really
something uh novel to the market and
some of them are really
only getting started to use by by major
protocols so uh
i will not stop on on this because these
are these ones are obvious but i'd
rather go directly to the
token distribution schedule so now the
first emission of cubes is 2 million
tokens and
you see there is a distribution of what
was going on so and to the launch pad it
was
only a small amount gone
and the other part so this is a three
percent of the total emission which will
reach 65 million cubes
uh and uh
all the rest of the emission will
gradually uh be released uh in line with
this curve so starting from the sixth
month
so from the date of the cube launch so
meaning that
for this six months the emission will
become will be stable and then uh over
the period of 48 months so it will be
gradually released with
somewhat increased speed
uh
the cube
in q3 we are going to release what we
can what is called uh
v cube so um
i don't remember how it's
deceived so uh but actually the the the
thing is very easy uh big cubes will be
used to
vote uh
on the gauche that will be distributing
the cube uh funds uh for to different
farms so minions there for example if
you are going to run a farm with your
token launched on flat cube
uh then you can uh go to to the gauche
and vote for allocating a certain amount
of cubes so your farm is about so means
that besides uh your tokens farming so
you will get also the allocation from
flat cube as well
so and this is some somewhat that's a
proven uh
proved to be really successful in the
market and we also wanted to introduce
it uh at our uh
tower decks
uh there will be also such activities
like whitelisting of other tokens to
decks using cube like
different distribution investing
mechanics like uh
yield farming boosts for vcu holders and
farmers for locking liquidity so a lot
of really interesting things that will
be going on and uh
again so keep subscribed
to our news channels to get
first to know about uh new things that
we'll be launching
um
yeah uh yeah and the latest now that uh
now all farms on uh
that's uh managed by the defy lines and
flat cube will be uh accruing uh rewards
and cube tokens so you have may have
seen already these changes so that's
pretty so uh
i think i managed to do this yeah sorry
at least if you essentially better read
it
and it worked really well it was
concisely quick does anybody have any
questions for uh vlad before we move on
yeah so basically it's curve right
yeah yeah so this is really similar to
curve and
so what they are doing but it's not only
curved because
our guys
constantly monitoring different defy
protocols what they are doing if there
are anything that we believe will be
successful uh we also
see how we can implement this uh in flat
cube and also think about
our own unique features
okay thank you
no more no more questions if not thank
you very much in this case i will switch
to my cell phone and yeah yeah it will
disconnect for a while
sure thing man thank you that was
excellent excellent stuff excellent
stuff um
all right uh
next up we have another ever scale grant
winner uh we have daniel from
identicspace uh he's here with us
identics and i'm reading this is a learn
to earn quest games creator for web 3
onboarding so
i'm going to let daniel tell you uh the
rest but sounds very interesting daniel
if you're ready you're up
yeah thank you ron do you hear me well i
didn't test my sound
and camera yeah you're good
okay
um okay so we are new kids on the blog
and we're not so serious as you all guys
we are about games
and gamification so my name is daniel
daniel neviskov and i'm the product
manager of the identity space quest
platform and uh first i'll tell you some
few words about the project itself and
then i'll show you some screens and some
working versions of the product
so um
you all know of course that crypto and
web 3 are still very complex concepts
for most people for crypto native people
for noobs as we call them and each of us
at the same time has an experience of
explaining what is what free and what is
crypt and why it's so cool
uh for me personally uh back to 2017
when i first was introduced to crypto
world uh uh it took about three months
to understand what it's all about and
why it is at all working and why it is
so cool
and uh so it's kind of a down the rabbit
hole thing
and
one of uh similar to our project is is
named rabbit hole by the way they also
do some quiz games to onboard new users
to web3
so uh
a team of old friends uh in uh december
2021 um i got together about this idea
of web 3 educational quest education
in general uh how to onboard the next to
one million new users
and uh this team uh
consisted of alexey varabe stephan
uh uh many of you know them i
guess pinchuk and vladimir kanin our
founder founders they realized that what
three
in itself is a game
and we all played this game for um for
some time
to understand the all the all the ways
around
it
and if it's a game why not
we built accept this idea and build a
game uh to onboard
to web3
and the first uh first version uh was uh
around the text based games one of our
elders senior developers recalled that
there was some text quizzes uh
some time ago and
they do still exist by the way
and we
invented a way to explain uh
difficult things uh in them in a matter
of a quiz wizard or a quest game
within the telegram bot
which gives you simple tasks explains
step by step what you must do to have
this
hands-on experience
without
being
exposed to very difficult blockchain
crypto things just to make some at least
one transaction set up at least one
wallet understand
not the whole thing but i
understand that seed is a very important
thing it must save it somewhere in very
safe place
so we uh
made the first version quest bot
on telegram i'll show you the link
and uh already around 300 persons uh
passed this quest and then we made a web
version of this uh of of the same
scenario request and um first
when we thought about what kind of
project can be uh introduced within this
uh quest game and polygon came first
because uh because of speed and and
price of transactions which is not
expensive at all
uh by the way the speeds are not good at
polygon sometimes it takes
20 minutes to make
to make some transactions
so that our users have to wait
for some time
and
but at least this mvp version of a
polygon based quest game my internet
connection is unstable do you hear me
well
okay yeah we hear you yeah we hear you
great
thank you uh so we we made this first
version of web uh webquest and the
telegram blog quest and uh that's when
we understood all these game design
gamification things and sequence of
steps and rewards things and levels and
dead ends of course for users and
time
to
not to lose a user when he started
at some tasks and
steps and we found our voice and the
narrative
and the whole story by the way
we have a mascot it's a female bot uh we
call we call her identics uh i'll share
i'll show you
with your picture
of her
and she helps she's a guide she helps
the user to pass
all the steps in within quest line
and um well we learned how to create
accounts in secure web3 model uh we'll
learn swat swapping one talking versus
another and helping user to do this
explaining with some screenshots and or
sometimes sometimes even screencasts uh
how to do this uh we check transactions
on polygon scan and track what
transaction the user uh account made to
help him or her uh to go further
with the steps
and um
oh well
uh
one of the first steps of course is
installing the wallet in our case with
polygonquest it was a metamask wallet
and we need to switch it from method to
polygon and without explaining the user
what he is to do because it's too
difficult for our crypto naive users to
get the idea of networks and blockchains
and different blockchains etc
and we give
them our users players the idea of how
money comes in and what is the
transaction what is that drop and we
make them to make their first
transaction with the airdrop tokens to
get this really hands-on experience
of uh money comes in from the end money
goes into the air and someone receives
it and there is something else happens
after uh afterwards
and everything is uh tracked and
everything
nothing is lost
uh
so we're trying to be as clear uh not as
me myself or right now because i'm i'm
i'm a bit
nervous about explaining those game
scenes but we try to be more clear than
me
and uh in march we launched the first
version
uh so i i already told that 300 people
uh passed their first quest
um
we understand that community is
the most important thing and our
community is growing uh
organically naturally you know we don't
buy traffic
because we think that
incremental natural organic growth is
more important
and reliably stable than incentivized
one
especially consisted of bounty hunters
that came and go
users do not pay anything for passing
the quest our initial business model
includes funding from web 3 projects and
blockchain platforms who need new users
or explaining to their existing users
difficult things and who need of course
the community community growth so our
most valuable asset is community and
therefore we launch the
uh twitter and medium and telegram and
discord of course and all the links i'll
share them with you
we do not have talking native token yet
but we plan to issue uh one right after
the our community grows significantly
and uh we've got
uh we get this product market feed
and the quests for polygon are ready to
use and right now uh we
at the end of march we received the
grant from defy alliance to develop
quest for ever scale products and there
will be quest for setting up a evo
wallet uh sending the receiving
transaction swapping tokens at flat cube
and sending bridge to transaction a
bridge transaction from
with the help of actus bridge and
staking and farming tokens will be um
also uh
presented to users in the forum quest as
well
uh also our solution will use a
self-sovereign identity model identics
fast
quest providers will issue verifiable
credentials for quest users to prove
their skills and reputation
and identics bus will be used to get
bonuses and their drops in future quests
as well
so this is about all i wanted to tell
you about the project itself and now i
can share with you some screens
also share with your video with a
very
high speed video on how a user can spend
uh can can pass a
a quest
if you allow me maybe some
one or two minutes run yes yes yes
absolutely i think that's i think that's
what we want yeah absolutely great
so i share my screen
and uh
this is it
you see
yes we do ah great
so uh this is our website
space learn to earn quest games for web
free space onboarding
[Music]
and
this is the version of everscale quest
you see there uh
this is a quest map with ever wallet
installation quest
uh
with connecting the wallet to additive
space to track the user to help him uh
and wallet deploy and transfer to ever
maybe this step will be a
change to another one and then we swap
and then we
make some bridge
quest as
well so this is our team
uh
now the internet is not very good but at
least i hope you hear me and see so it's
alex
and i promised you to show a high-speed
version of passing the text so there
will be some music i hope it won't
it will not
[Music]
uh it the sound went away
sound disappeared
uh we can't hear you daniel
[Music]
there you are now you're back now you're
back okay i think that the sound of
music
[Music]
website
[Music]
maybe maybe better just to
remove the sound because
daniel we can't hear you daniel
[Music]
it's it's listen it's a great attempt um
but we can hear the music and then we
can hear you somewhere down a dark
tunnel saying something
there's a train that's coming
completely that was the idea
it's okay sorry
you're doing fine i switched off the
music
and you see that i'm already swapping
a
short explanation instruction and uh
airdrop was already made the user has
him
in his uh
her wallet some matics received and now
we ask him or her to swap it from matic
to use the t
explaining at every step what is going
on
and then in the next step we'll ask him
or her to send the usdt to our address
back to receive twice as much
as he
her ascent to get this idea of sending
it to a talking to someone
well at the end the user
is getting a lot of experience a lot of
xp and some real use dts
up to 2 usdt for the moment because we
are paying our our proper funds uh
polygon did not pay for that
yet i hope so
and
well that's it that's about it
listen i mean you know i i understand
the the the showmanship and you know
wanting to show the video and everything
else but i think you know the people on
this call pretty much get it um that's
uh that's a very very important and
amazing thing especially for onboarding
exactly something that can uh
can just make it simple for the average
user which is phenomenal
absolutely phenomenal
absolutely i can see why you got the
grants congratulations by the way thank
you
yep um so does anybody have money with
you yes please please please you can
even while we're here you can even uh
drop it in the uh zoom chat and i'll put
it into youtube so everybody can see it
there and it'll it'll roll on i
appreciate it daniel thank you so very
much excellent work keep up the good
work um

uh let's
i can't hear you
run your mutes
oh my god i'm unbeaten i'm sorry
where did i lose everybody uh i
apologize happens he said let's
let's okay let's move to
let's move to marina uh marina is back
with us from i.t gold uh she's gonna
talk about uh something about creating
degenerative collections
on grand bazaar hope i got that right
the generation right right something
like that ron thank you thank you hello
everyone great to hear to see you again
i'm sorry i'm sorry can you uh daniel
can you stop sharing your screen please
yes i'm trying to do this
okay
sorry marina go ahead
oh yeah okay
um guys some of you may remember the
contest the nft collection distributed
generative art contest
um uh some time ago
and um
a lot of
teams took part in this contest and um
the product i want to present today is
basically the result of collaboration of
i.t gold and one of the
winners the third place of this contest
so bubble team
and
as you may probably know
itigold has grand bazaar marketplace and
this service i'm attacking today i hope
will help numerous creators to provide
their own
uh generative
collections which they had been probably
planning for a long time but did not
maybe understand how to implement
because it's
a bit challenging
and it can definitely
this service i mean
it can definitely make the process
easier while still staying a bit
challenging i should say for an average
user as for my taste but however now i'm
making a detailed video
which i hope will remove most of the
questions at least for those who are
already in the blockchain and especially
have any idea
of what generative thought is and
besides
we've created the technical support team
in telegram
sorry group in telegram and the link to
which i will now ask ron to post for our
youtube audience yep happy to do it here
is it in chat
uh so for those who are
who will hurry to test the service we
can immediately contact the developers
and ask their questions if they face any
trouble because i suppose
it should be we are just launching and
there can be some technical issues or i
don't know maybe some misunderstandings
let's look on the website i will show
i will show it to you because it
uh i should say it's not so scary as it
sounds maybe here is it so bubble dot io
please welcome
and as you see
the sign in button leads us straightly
to authorization
um
page and here we have
three well-known applications for
authorization i will use my other space
sorry guys
i have to
sorry that myself to show you something
oh come on
now well my phone
has
put me
okay
well
here we go
well
here is it i suppose here soon we will
be able to see a lot of
collections uh successfully uploaded to
grand bazaar but no nothing is here
please welcome
uh i will show you how to create the
collection uh the process is easy to
understand easy enough to understand and
we can see that there are uh three types
of collections you can
create with grant bazaar support without
it or
just using the image generator please
read the details while you'll be
sorry
read the details just to understand what
you are doing i will no
i will not um
i will not uh give a lot of details
right now just to show you the process
because it's
easy enough
uh well
my favorite renoir is here
well
you can see that here we can set up the
limit or rarities
for different
pieces for example
i don't know
like that and create new rarity of
like rare let it be
with 30
pieces and something like legendary
you can use anything you like of course
that's your image imagination legging
and gender re okay
five
something like that
uh and uh here is the percentage of the
royal team for the creator let's set up
ten percent it's
commonly used thing
here we have some interesting parameters
we can also set for our collection it
can be anything because you know it
depends on your idea on on the
idea of the collection it can be numbers
switches files and um different i don't
know for example
uh
[Music]
something like that
oh
sorry my graphics
and you can set the storage location
like in blockchain and image generator
everywhere
for
them
does not like my name
okay and we can set
um
for example different variants of the i
i've already tested it so i have this
here
and
it can be trousers i don't know hats
clothes any any kind of clothing any
kind of font
or any parameters you should you'd like
to change in your on your images
well for example
uh due to some technical
here we can see that uh collection
just
was created
and
still not uploaded to the blockchain we
can
uh sorry i will
now go
to the
uh video i have
done because
i i hope it will be better
than
previous one because i also if i'm also
afraid of this
you know sound issues but any in any
case
here you can see that we've got um a
collection with the
blockchain address which we can after
the transaction is confirmed the address
uh appears and you can check it in the
blockchain
oh come on here is it
sorry for the russian browser in any
case you can see the details and so on
and then um we can go straightly to the
to generating the images itself
and here are some layers which with the
parameters we've said before and this
image these layers can be adjusted by
clicking on this gear icon
and
that is the challenging part because
maybe for some
[Music]
people who
for an average user who never done it
before it may seems a little bit
complicated but in any case you can see
that you can set up the
rarity
the
which indicates how often
this or that image can appear
and
[Music]
determine all the parameters all the
things
here you can see that
drag and drop
instruments are here so it's easy enough
well
now uh you can see that this collection
contains uh the images of the warriors
they have different hats and weapon and
you can set up all the things
let's go to the deployment itself
when everything is done
we just
sorry let's see how it is
how it is done
and we can say if we will put all
possible
uh it will generate all the items
at the same time then we save and upload
and here here is it
we can
the collection has been successfully
created and we can observe it
several different
um
images appeared with different rarities
with different parameters we've said
before and
now we can put it on on ground bazaar
and see it on the ground bazaar
well something like that
let me show
so you are doing confirming the
transactions
using your wallet
here is it
you can put it on sale
right from the
so bubble service
and it appears on the ground bazaar
successfully
so well yeah that is basically the idea
i hope you like it because i
personally
waited for
a long time for
some service which can help to create
such kind of collections
well so please use your imagination dear
creators welcome
we are waiting for you
and also join
the
[Music]
join the support group if you will face
any problems and you will definitely
facing please

um
in any time guys your questions are
welcome in our group so
please
okay five once you've figured out your
microphone um marina's here she's not
going anywhere um i have a
a little bit of a uh
interjection to make right when uh
we were presenting there's something
that's coming in that i think needs to
just be stated there's there's gonna be
an announcement in the chats but um
uh the everscale dovetools and sdk team
uh wants everybody to know and i'm gonna
i'm gonna have to read this because it
just came up um
we're ready to enable the new tvm
instructions in everscale main net
uh this update will lead to a breaking
change
in account format which may cause your
nodes to stop working
to avoid these problems you need to
update your dap servers and validator
nodes to the latest version uh dap
server uh version
equal or greater than 0.1.5
validate validator node the latest
master commit at the moment we support
both account format versions in public
api and in dap server api so that
applications can smoothly migrate to the
new account version to do it just update
sdk to the latest version
greater than or equal to 1.31.0
uh if you work with api directly enable
the new http header we encourage you to
do this asap because we will support
both account formats only temporarily
um and uh i dropped those and i dropped
that link
into uh youtube so uh please uh guys pay
attention uh and again there will be an
announcement coming soon uh throughout
all the chats so i was asked to do that
uh
right off the bat again uh marina thank
you let's uh
go to our final segment of the day uh
where is he where's that boat you still
have an internet connection there
just about buddy just about all right so
so i got a lovely video as well yeah i
got to do my thing right so uh this week
it's uh the king of coin banter
the motor tongue blockchain troubadour
ben
smith
oh that that was short and sweet i like
that one buddy right i'm gonna keep this
very very quick in case my internet does
dip out so uh first one i've got for you
tons of scanners become ever scanned if
you haven't seen yes brilliant
a very very cool gentleman called tez
mac has been doing some very very cool
uh videos all about the excellent work
we're doing here at ever so please go go
support the guy honestly it's really
good content easy he's quite a
well-known dude as well
uh scale wallets ever wallace has become
scale wallets yeah and surf now supports
tokens or whatever yay
ever is having an air drop for people
using octus bridge check out the details
uh the fire cube poker poker tournament
has kicked off so you would have seen
the presentation last week but let's go
in so yay
uh aml ama i've got wrote down here
which sounds quite cool on its own but
there was a very cool ama uh session
with aml who are a uh
a team who've come through the grants
program with a very very uh interesting
product maybe a little bit kind of
corporate and but definitely very needed
in this world
uh boosted staking program has offered
double incentives for those taking part
so do check this out if you're honest
and this one i really liked 30
plus teams from the t-zos hackathon and
have basically stated their intents want
to keep on working on ever following
from the uh hackathon so that is
exciting stuff really isn't it 30 new
development teams who are thinking about
making the move
come over come to us
uh evelens have uh released some nfts
for people who invested in their token
sale i believe so that's quite nice of
them uh ever jews another grants program
have gone through have opened up their
alpha testing so again if you're uh able
to help them test what they're building
please do
so
the jews d-u-e-s
yeah nothing to do with um hebrewism
that would be an interesting thing
but yeah finally um as some of you may
have seen uh last wednesday i kicked off
a little spin-off show
kind of sides thing for never mind the
 coins called never mind the rumor
coins called never mind the rumor
mill uh so basically every monday
wednesday and friday uh myself and
anastasia who a lot of you may know are
basically just going to scan the markets
troll the latest gossip columns and give
you the most probably unconfirmed news
you can find
and the last one went out last night
it's only on spotify for now because
 youtube are being buggers to me
youtube are being buggers to me
but i'll sort it out and it should be on
youtube soon and that's my bits thank
you very much everyone hope you like the
view
i'm jealous i love that view right now
not quite the view i have but uh we'll
leave that for another time uh
thank you ben thank you very much okay
uh
who has questions on zoom
going once going twice
all right we do have questions from
youtube and we do have questions that
were written in let's um
i'm going to start last first because uh
somebody's asking questions for marina
uh what are the games that will use
grand bazaar i think that's from marina
what are the games what games they're
going to use grand bazaar i
i don't um
if i get it right
we are
uh definitely supporting um
a new game five project for wars it will
start it will be launched on ethereum
network and its collection of nfts will
be displayed on ground bazaar and will
be
through our launchpad
um
page special page special web page and
uh definitely
you will be able to buy
but not using of course everscale
wallets but
you will need
metamask or something like that so
no games
on everscale except rustcop
which is well known and had a contest
with the new cars
for the new collection of cars
recently
no games are
used
or displayed on grand bazaar so maybe
you should rephrase your question
somehow
yeah i guess there's a little bit of
vague maybe maybe it's about the
launchpad way webpage because
i will definitely do another
presentation about that and i
soon will held i suppose on thursday i
will hold
um
a small ammo
session where the bull wars
on grand bazaar
discord server i suppose so yes if you
need any information just come to our
telegram groups ask your questions we
will answer everything i suppose like
that yeah it's the easiest way thank you
uh also i just uh just for future
reference on this uh uh
the the term ama
is often not understood by western
english-speaking folks it's it's just
ama
sorry i know is that no no that's okay i
i know i i run into it all the time and
when people hear it in a conversation
they hear amma they don't understand
what is that yeah yeah ama uh ask me an
anime yeah right
okay marina thank you very much um if if
you
uh whoever you were uh you have an
update to your question to make it more
specific i'd be happy to answer it let's
also go to
a couple so let's start with questions
that were written in to us and i have
five of them in a row
uh the first is any news on when the
dune and everscale next batch will be
sent out uh i
wrote the question to the group uh
before the call began and here's the
answer that it got
uh the last batch was sent out on march
23rd
so
it's
theoretically uh expected that it would
probably go out about the same time in
april
uh however uh it might uh take
longer so
give or take i don't want to use the
word soon uh give or take we're looking
maybe
somewhere between
april 20th and may 17th
but
the goal is end of april i hope that
answers that question um
right uh
i'm gonna go from question one directly
to question five question five is what
are the plans for the second annual
anniversary
uh right so there are actually a few
uh
there's one
being hosted in bali
uh indonesia uh i personally am not
gonna be able to attend that but there's
a major global thing that's being
uh
created uh joanne should i should i say
something or should i not should i keep
it secret or should i no no it's not a
secret it's not a secret it's actually
out in uh the community the community
chat there's been an invite um i sent it
out twice so
i can do a reminder today but we're
doing a metaverse party in in meta and
no no mona yeah that's the space the
platform we're using is mona and we're
setting up a really cool environment
inside it that's going to be the ever
scale space that's being designed right
now there's a bar there's a dance floor
there's multiple levels there's a club
and music and it's going to be really
cool
so i sound kind of crappy
i'm getting over cold
well we'll will we be able to
take some
digital adult beverages here yes that's
the plan that's exactly what it is and
it and i've seen it and it's actually
really cool
it's it's for the it's absolutely
perfect for the introverted geek
yes
you'll be able to sip whatever you have
whatever beverage you buy for yourself
but you'll be able to uh manifest it in
a in a metaverse so um it's pretty cool
and and given you know the conditions
that we're living under and the
restrictive travel and everything else
um i think it's the perfect solution i
think it's gonna be really cool i mean
obviously you won't be able to hook up
with anybody but
well you could but
right in front of you so there you go so
you can e-hook up any anywhere by the
way that's kind of like the trend these
days you know that right
especially in asian asian countries
parts of the world
so there you go you'll know all about it
no i don't
no i don't but i do
yeah
um snl skit anyway uh yeah so that's the
idea it's gonna be an ever scale party
in a metaverse so that's being worked on
and um and like i said it looks pretty
good looks pretty darn good um now i'm
gonna get i'm gonna sort of batch these
questions because i think they're coming
either from the same person or the same
type of
i'm gonna i'm gonna
be nice ron be nice ron be nice ron
uh the same type of thinking um so the
first question is when will partners
return all their tokens um i think we
covered uh at the beginning of this call
exactly what we're doing
the question to me
is a little juvenile
i mean
short of
taking a gun and putting it to
somebody's head i don't know what's your
idea and how to return those tokens is
there is there a way to do that
i would say this
i would say that any organization
that received tokens
which they essentially either dumped or
did nothing with uh to benefit everscale
has done less damage to everscale than
they have to their own reputation
which uh i would encourage anyone
after we
pass this
growth phase three which we're doing
right now
uh
there will be results and those results
are going to be public so if you have uh
you know the incentive
to contact these folks and say hey
return the money i would only support
that because that would be the right
thing to do so i think any company any
organization who comes and doesn't do
what they're supposed to do has a
reputation uh as a as as a business uh
and that business should worry about
their reputation more than they should
about a small amount of tokens in the
grand scheme of things and the grand
scheme of
uh having received whatever it might be
a couple of hundred thousand tokens or a
couple of million tokens whatever that
might be
that that's chump change in the big
world and the question would be was it
worth it and if it wasn't worth it find
a way to return it because that would do
wonders for your reputation not
returning it would
make you look bad and make your business
suffer as a result so um but as far as
how to do that like
are you asking if there's a way to force
that to happen
of course not there's no way to do that
we're not a company
we're not a corporation
we don't sue people and we can't get
sued as a result because we are a
decentralized community and as such what
we do is we correct mistakes so um and
the same thing goes for your second
question which is uh when will
sub-governance return their tokens
that's actually a good question a few of
them did uh the
global community sub-governance returned
their tokens
the
uh indian sub-governance returned their
tokens which i should have to say that
should be applauded these people
understood that this is the right way to
do that these are people who are
dedicated to the community and in fact
rahman if you're listening maybe what we
should do is put on the forum uh who
returned their tokens they tried trial
and error they failed or not even failed
i i don't like that word they tried it
didn't work maybe they'll try again but
what they did do is the right thing and
they'll return the tokens
um i think we should highlight
and underscore uh some of those folks
because they did
a wonderful thing uh of course there are
other sub-governances like wiki
sub-governances which you know uh 70 of
them were as we realized later nothing
more than con artists
who are never going to return those
tokens
what do you suggest we do
yeah
start a war
you know uh so no um we're not gonna get
those tokens back if they don't want to
give them back but the reputations are
forever ruined and anywhere they go on
the ever scale blockchain to try
anything
will immediately uh bring the
community's uh
wrath
upon them and they'll never be able to
do anything there was a discussion on
the forum that uh there are many
sub-governments who has
tokens on their balances and they do
nothing uh for the past three months uh
there was a discussion that just uh
asked those guys to return tokens on the
giver
that's the main discussion yeah yep
simple as that and if they do that then
we get them back uh and then the fourth
question is any news about marketing see
again
i understand that some people come to
the network and they're new and they
haven't seen all of the this is weekly
call number 99 there's 98 before this
and of course i don't expect you to
watch every one of them but we've
discussed this many times marketing what
this is a community blockchain there is
no marketing team
that's uh how how will you hold on
let me finish how will your market
personal computer
yeah
that's a gr that's actually an excellent
point right how are you going to market
the personal computer use it
any news about marketing that question
actually goes to you
market
go we have a like we like to say
sometimes from a technological
standpoint we have a decentralized
supercomputer the centralized backend
and the one on the techie side on the
other side we have basically a new way
to do everything you could do on
ethereum but better faster cheaper
market that who are you asking are you
asking me to do it i'm not a marketing
person uh
this is a
bunch of companies and people that have
come together if you want to market it
market it the that question goes to you
not to
me or anybody else so i hope you take
that into account and do some
wonderful wonderful things with that
market it it's up to you and as a result
it'll only benefit you
okay uh yeah well there is a there is a
one term in english called shilling
shilling is uh is about like shilling
some coins on the twitter etc and uh i
know a few persons who want to do that
you are free to go guys
but that's not marketing that's chilling
at any rate it's up to you it's what it
what it comes down to it's up to you the
tools are there the uh
access is there you do it all right um
youtube questions
right uh
did the development team and i don't
know what you mean by team there are
many many teams on everscale contact
kraken
and two
when
will you contact kraken and three does
the team plan to contact kraken
um
so
uh i don't know the answer to that
question other than i did get a response
from
one of our community members and i'm not
gonna mention his name he left the call
early but he says kraken sucks
so
so that's the response to that uh i
don't know no um why don't you contact
kraken i i don't know what uh you expect
somebody else to do um and i'm not
saying that cracking sucks i'm
paraphrasing with somebody or quoting
rather what somebody else said uh it's a
hard question to answer i don't know
contact them if you want to
uh can i help you a little bit just so
that you don't have to answer a hundred
percent of the questions sure sure
please yes for you to breathe a little
bit yes
on the market and i mean first of all i
think uh folks should watch the amaze
session where joanne interviewed nikita
and there were quite a lot of news there
about you know restructuring twitter
activity not the chilean but more like
you know
professional in the work with
influencers and et cetera et cetera so
there was some substance there
there are a lot of news coming up you
saw partnership with the maze
the fire lines is cracking news almost
every day so it's it's also marketing so
i wouldn't say
i would just i would you know i don't
know joe if you want to say a couple of
words on on your take from the interview
with the kitten yeah
sorry nikita went um
fully into the whole plan and i was just
just trying to find all the links um
because there's also
a written
um
i'm dropping it down here there's the
youtube version somebody can just watch
it and then somebody also did a written
version
transcribed pretty much of everything
that we said so if you don't want to
watch something and you want to skim
through it there's a lot of information
there
it touches point touches the points from
events to social media to overarching
marketing there's
there's an entire plan so there is
marketing going on but
also what what
ron said before because we are a
decentralized community it also depends
on you too but there's really easy
things that you could do to support like
just being active with the twitter
account um
when people post following each other
liking or commenting or
you know um there are a lot of accounts
that
uh post like what what's your favorite
favorite uh undervalued coin or what are
some gems that we should look at you
know you can talk about ever
there are a lot of ways to get involved
going into reddit going into the
cryptocurrency um in developer
subreddits
there's a lot of things that you can
also do
yourself
and that's
that's pretty much it i'll drop the
links and then if ron could please put
that in too oh yeah i put i put that one
in oh you did i have another one i'll
find it okay give me give me the other
one on exchanges as we all remember defy
alliance took the challenge to on the
listings i'm hearing that quite a lot
is going on i know a lot if you're still
with us
and can say couple of words or
you're struggling through this
connection issues
i think
i'm here
dude you want to see a couple of words
if you are in the loop on the define
lines plans on the listings
um
actually uh yeah we
have uh some
real really good negotiations but i
cannot discover them now
so uh just just keep in mind
so something big is coming
intriguing is coming
sorry guys uh i i cannot disclose it now
because otherwise it all may be ruined
so
please
wait a little while now something good
good is coming is good that's that's
good
we're waiting for lots of big big stuff
to happen
okay
all right um next question
right
um oh so a little bit of background um
on this guy uh nomad um him and i have
gone back and forth on the forum
uh so uh his question is i'm not i'm not
gonna i'm not gonna
hurt the guy um ron and chuck
and i'm actually translating
brought
uh
scam projects
that have
hurt the network
do you plan to return the tokens into
the network
i think the gentleman is actually
referring to qan quick app ninja or
pay2k
uh question two
uh why
aren't the project
why don't the projects have leaders that
can bear financial responsibility
uh projects like the free the the
everscale academy
uh
have something called how to survive in
the woods
how to fix computers
for fifteen hundred dollars and he's
asking me personally and two other uh
gentlemen who i'm not gonna name because
i'm gonna i'm gonna handle this this
question
uh how do we uh uh deal with this all
right so um
okay
ron be nice ron be nice ron be nice
uh
my first question to you is have you
ever
actually i don't know
ran a company
if you ever actually ran a project
have you ever invested in anything
um
i guess you can ask bear stearns to
return your money
you can ask
i don't know any project that you've
ever invested in because you believed in
it when it was first started and then
lost money in it i guess you can
i don't know you could try to sue them
or something like that
but
i have a feeling you don't have
um
any experience as an entrepreneur i
think you're just somebody who probably
sits at home and just thinks so well
this is my money and that's fine that's
fine you're right you're a community
member and so forth so there is no way
to do any of the things that you're
asking um
you
clearly see that there are
a lot of organizations that are part of
everscale that are very successful
that have made extremely uh immense
contributions of them everexes one uh
vlad here for brock's this is obviously
i mean you can you can count uh
dozens of successful projects does that
mean that if uh somebody brings a
project
to the community that doesn't work at a
time when the network was just an infant
right i mean
let's let's consider the network uh
pre-pubescent at this point a juvenile
not even a juvenile 12 to 13 year old
um and the 12 to 13 year old goes around
and you know
breaks a window uh throws a baseball
through
somebody's through somebody's car window
does that mean that
we
are individually responsible for
uh you know what what do we do we just
we just get rid of the child we we just
what i mean i i don't i don't really
understand what you're asking for
who should return the tokens should they
the partners uh that were bad return the
tokens yes
absolutely 100 they should
how are we going to make them do that
there's no way to do that
we can ask them to do it we can uh
you know
rely on their
professionalism but at the end of the
day
if their intention was to scam they
scammed
so
i'm having trouble answering the
question
on a professional level i can only
answer it on just a human level which is
to say that your question is kind of
stupid excuse my saying so
um there's no way to do it so
um and if you want me to take
responsibility because i supported
something i'll tell you what i supported
a million things in my life and only so
many of them became successful uh so i
would revert back to you and say how
many projects have you accomplished
where you were successful at them and
how many failures did you have and have
you answered for any of those failures
so i'll wait on you to answer that i
apologize i know it was a little harsh
but
maybe somebody else can give their
version of what they think
anyone
i did my best to be diplomatic but
these questions annoy the hell out of me
um
anyone no
if not
we are
done
uh we did go over hour and a half but i
warned everybody at the beginning of the
call that we had a lot of presentations
we had a lot of information and frankly
wow what a call how much do we have to
digest now i know i have to digest a lot
so
please have a wonderful rest of your
week have a wonderful weekend and we
will see you again on tuesday
bye everybody
