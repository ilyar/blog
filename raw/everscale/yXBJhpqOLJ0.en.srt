and uh we have deployed a new one
with six

318
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279

403
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,949
like starting to
uh to roll out the governance

404

uh to roll out the governance
 

405
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,590
uh to roll out the governance
uh the bftg the governance to zero

406
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
uh the bftg the governance to zero
 

407
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,430
uh the bftg the governance to zero
system and that's the first kind of

408
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,440
system and that's the first kind of
 

409
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,190
system and that's the first kind of
application so

410

cover first round
and

562
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
and
 

563
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,230
and
first round should be on the with lockup

564
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,240
first round should be on the with lockup
 

565

567
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,710
investing period
the second condition it should be

568
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
the second condition it should be
 

569
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,790
the second condition it should be
project without any free flow to the

570
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:40,800
project without any free flow to the
 

571

market
 

573
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,230
market
so it on swap will be first

574
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240
so it on swap will be first
 

575
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,949
so it on swap will be first
exchange for it project

576

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,790
and
the third condition uh projects

580
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:52,800
the third condition uh projects
 

581
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,150
the third condition uh projects
must supply

582
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
must supply
 

583
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,310
must supply
uh

supply liquidity for farming
 

591
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,230
supply liquidity for farming
and maybe after some project three five

592
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240
and maybe after some project three five
 

593
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,230
and maybe after some project three five
we will change condition uh we have a

594
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:10,240
we will change condition uh we have a
 

595
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,069
we will change condition uh we have a
lot of projects within this negotiation

596
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079
lot of projects within this negotiation
 

597
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,189
lot of projects within this negotiation
now

now
 

599
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,909
now
and we'll watch how it will work

600
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:15,919
and we'll watch how it will work
 

601
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,990
and we'll watch how it will work
for their project it's interesting

602
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,000
for their project it's interesting
 

603
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,590
for their project it's interesting
because

604
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
because
 

605
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,429
because
they want to start to work with return

606
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
they want to start to work with return
 

607

um yeah i was thinking uh

986
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:07,679
um yeah i was thinking uh
 

987
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,350
um yeah i was thinking uh
is this uh

988
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,360

should this be a general requirement for
uh for the future future products uh

992

have um yield farming already in your
 

1005
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,830
have um yield farming already in your
product in process

1006
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:27,840
product in process
 

1007
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,830
product in process
and i believe it's open source so is

1008
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:29,840
and i believe it's open source so is
 

1009
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,710
and i believe it's open source so is
there

1010
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:30,720
there
 

1011
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,029
there
any sense to develop this stuff if if

1012
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:33,039
any sense to develop this stuff if if
 

1013
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,190
any sense to develop this stuff if if
there's already a solution like that or

1014
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,200
there's already a solution like that or
 

1015
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,510
there's already a solution like that or
maybe it's easier to include the open

1016
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:37,520
maybe it's easier to include the open
 

1017
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,430
maybe it's easier to include the open
source uh

1018
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:39,440
source uh
 

1019
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,430
source uh
if it's needed in double taxes later on

1020
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:43,440
if it's needed in double taxes later on
 

1021
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,430
if it's needed in double taxes later on
maybe it should be included

1022
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:45,440
maybe it should be included
 

1023
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,110

added yield farming but
 

1057
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,789
added yield farming but
we can think uh about this

1058
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:32,799
we can think uh about this
 

1059
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,310
we can think uh about this
uh question and uh we of course we can

which can still take time uh to
 

1073
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,549
which can still take time uh to
implement uh open source code into our

1074
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:50,559
implement uh open source code into our
 

1075

yeah yeah i believe what it meant
what it was meant to be uh is making

1160

what it was meant to be uh is making
 

1161
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,430
what it was meant to be uh is making
effective uh use of the

1162
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:37,440
effective uh use of the
 

1163
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,470
effective uh use of the
of the

1164
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:38,480
of the
 

1165
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,510

well fees collection mechanism and stuff
 

1169
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,389
well fees collection mechanism and stuff
like that so maybe double check that

1170
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:44,399
like that so maybe double check that
 

1171
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,510

soft criteria which
 

1213
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,310
soft criteria which
could be probably easily translated into

1214
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:38,320
could be probably easily translated into
 

1215
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,269
could be probably easily translated into
it sort of like a standardized system to

1216
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:41,279
it sort of like a standardized system to
 

1217
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,630
it sort of like a standardized system to
to

1218
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:42,640
to
 

1219
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,909

to
 

1221
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,029
to
maybe

1222
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:45,039
maybe
 

1223
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,490
maybe
help judges

1224

00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:54,799
framework to
 

1231
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,149
framework to
objectively

1232
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:56,159
objectively
 

1233
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,269
objectively
judge every solution and to have like a

1234
00:29:59,269 --> 00:29:59,279
judge every solution and to have like a
 

1235
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,149
judge every solution and to have like a
set of scores that can be

1236
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:02,159
set of scores that can be
 

1237
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,909
set of scores that can be
then translated into

1238
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:03,919
then translated into
 

1239
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,310
then translated into
a single score that we have in the

1240
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:06,320
a single score that we have in the
 

1241
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,389
a single score that we have in the
governance right now so

1242
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:08,399
governance right now so
 

1243
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,549
governance right now so
what do you guys think if

1244
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:10,559
what do you guys think if
 

1245
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,230
what do you guys think if
should should we

1246
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,240
should should we
 

1247
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,750
should should we
think about

1248
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:13,760
think about
 

1249
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,350
think about
um well

1250
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,360
um well
 

1251
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,269
um well
maybe standardizing the

1252
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,279
maybe standardizing the
 

1253
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,630
maybe standardizing the
the evaluation process or is it okay as

1254
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:20,640
the evaluation process or is it okay as
 

1255
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,630
the evaluation process or is it okay as
it is right now

1256
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:22,640
it is right now
 

1257
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,549
it is right now
good idea

1258
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:26,559

they put some score and they still uh
 

1281
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,029
they put some score and they still uh
leave some points for

1282
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:53,039
leave some points for
 

1283
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,230
leave some points for
um

1284
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,240
um
 

1285

personal sub subjective points from
 

1287
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,310
personal sub subjective points from
jurors

1288
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,320
jurors
 

1289
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,950
jurors

yeah i don't know i just didn't feel any
problems with the

1292
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:02,720
problems with the
 

1293
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,990
problems with the
scores we have now but if jurors have

1294
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,000
scores we have now but if jurors have
 

1295
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,269
scores we have now but if jurors have
some troubles with uh valuation

1296
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:09,279
some troubles with uh valuation
 

1297
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,950
some troubles with uh valuation
probably yes i don't think it's a

1298
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:10,960
probably yes i don't think it's a
 

1299
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,190
probably yes i don't think it's a
problem for us

1300
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,200
problem for us
 

1301
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,990
problem for us
i

1302
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:14,000
i
 

1303
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,310
i
yeah alexey i think had some more

1304
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,320
yeah alexey i think had some more
 

1305
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:23,350
yeah alexey i think had some more
comments on that

1306
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:23,360

 

1307
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,549

yeah it's a good idea because it's

1308
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:26,559
yeah it's a good idea because it's
 

1309
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,990
yeah it's a good idea because it's
it's one of the

1310
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,000
it's one of the
 

1311
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,190
it's one of the
way to

1312
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,200
way to
 

1313
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,350
way to
make more clear

1314
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,360
make more clear
 

1315
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,350
make more clear
the assessments of the

1316
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:33,360
the assessments of the
 

1317
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,630
the assessments of the
different submissions and it will be

1318
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:36,640
different submissions and it will be
 

1319
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,029
different submissions and it will be
it will give a more

1320
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
it will give a more
 

1321
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,350
it will give a more
like understanding for participants

1322
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,360
like understanding for participants
 

1323
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,430
like understanding for participants
while they get such

1324
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:43,440
while they get such
 

1325
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,350
while they get such
marks and

1326
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:45,360
marks and
 

1327
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,149
marks and
make whole process more clear and

1328
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:48,159
make whole process more clear and
 

1329
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,509
make whole process more clear and
transparent

1330
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:49,519
transparent
 

1331
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,630
transparent
so i completely support this

1332
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:52,640
so i completely support this
 

1333
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,310
so i completely support this
uh it's

1334
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:54,320
uh it's
 

1335
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,950
uh it's
on one side it's it's a good approach uh

1336
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:56,960
on one side it's it's a good approach uh
 

1337
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,549
on one side it's it's a good approach uh
actually uh to make kind of uh

1338
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:00,559
actually uh to make kind of uh
 

1339
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,909
actually uh to make kind of uh
recommended

1340
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:01,919
recommended
 

1341
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,389
recommended
assessment framework yeah so what what

1342
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:04,399
assessment framework yeah so what what
 

1343
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,149
assessment framework yeah so what what
jurors should look like you know which

1344
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:06,159
jurors should look like you know which
 

1345
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,509
jurors should look like you know which
should look at

1346
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:07,519
should look at
 

1347
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,750
should look at
when checking the solution

1348
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:09,760
when checking the solution
 

1349
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,149
when checking the solution
but on the other side uh i don't think

1350
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:12,159
but on the other side uh i don't think
 

1351
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,590
but on the other side uh i don't think
that including this in the contest

1352
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:13,600
that including this in the contest
 

1353
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,230
that including this in the contest
criteria is is a good idea actually

1354
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,240
criteria is is a good idea actually
 

1355
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,190
criteria is is a good idea actually
because

1356
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:17,200
because
 

1357
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,549
because
uh

1358
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:18,559
uh
 

1359
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,149
uh
in this way you can you are removing the

1360
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:22,159
in this way you can you are removing the
 

1361
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,310
in this way you can you are removing the
um

1362
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:24,320
um
 

1363
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,990
um
how to put it

1364
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,000
how to put it
 

1365
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:35,029
how to put it
the

1366
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:35,039

 

1367
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,389

i mean that

1368
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:36,399
i mean that
 

1369
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,430
i mean that
some judges can use their own criteria

1370
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:39,440
some judges can use their own criteria
 

1371
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,710
some judges can use their own criteria
system to assess this or that work uh

1372
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:42,720
system to assess this or that work uh
 

1373
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,070
system to assess this or that work uh
and uh

1374
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,080
and uh
 

1375
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,669
and uh
if they can explain uh why they uh

1376
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:47,679
if they can explain uh why they uh
 

1377
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,950
if they can explain uh why they uh
put this mark so uh what's the reason to

1378
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:50,960
put this mark so uh what's the reason to
 

1379
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,190
put this mark so uh what's the reason to
impose uh someone some different system

1380
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:53,200
impose uh someone some different system
 

1381
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,909
impose uh someone some different system
to them because uh this was

1382
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:55,919
to them because uh this was
 

1383
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,269
to them because uh this was
in the very heart of return actually to

1384
00:32:59,269 --> 00:32:59,279
in the very heart of return actually to
 

1385
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,870
in the very heart of return actually to

rules and indication of how to judge but
we have

1758
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:42,960
we have
 

1759
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,670
we have
very complex uh contests and there are

1760
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:45,680
very complex uh contests and there are
 

1761

many uh hard criterias and soft
 

1763
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,510
many uh hard criterias and soft
criterias uh inside the contest proposal

criterias uh inside the contest proposal
 

1765
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,710
criterias uh inside the contest proposal
and that criterias are uh

1766
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:54,720
and that criterias are uh
 

1767
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,230
and that criterias are uh
already uh indicators of uh how to

1768
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,240
already uh indicators of uh how to
 

1769
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,230
already uh indicators of uh how to

okay okay there are two different topics
 

1775
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,390
okay okay there are two different topics
again

1776
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:06,400
again
 

1777
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,109
again
uh what to judge right you're right but

1778
00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:09,119
uh what to judge right you're right but
 

1779
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,990
uh what to judge right you're right but
uh every point uh

1780
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,000
uh every point uh
 

1781
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,349
uh every point uh
from the contest proposal uh should

1782
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:15,359
from the contest proposal uh should
 

1783
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,750
from the contest proposal uh should
should be taken into account

1784
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:17,760
should be taken into account
 

1785
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,950
should be taken into account
i think we

1786
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:18,960
i think we
 

1787
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,990
i think we
understand this

1788
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,000

 

1789
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,589

or everybody understands this so

1790
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:25,599
or everybody understands this so
 

1791
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,950
or everybody understands this so
as i

1792
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:26,960
as i
 

1793
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,030
as i
understand the proposed

1794
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,040
understand the proposed
 

1795
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,829
understand the proposed
schema is just a formalization

1796
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:31,839
schema is just a formalization
 

1797
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,109
schema is just a formalization
of

1798
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:33,119
of
 

1799
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,950
of
the scoring not not a measure to

1800
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:36,960
the scoring not not a measure to
 

1801
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,390
the scoring not not a measure to
a point

1802
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:38,400
a point
 

1803
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,550
a point
to judge to

1804
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:40,560
to judge to
 

1805
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,430
to judge to
make his decision somehow it's just a

1806
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:43,440
make his decision somehow it's just a
 

1807
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,069
make his decision somehow it's just a
formalization to make the

1808
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:46,079
formalization to make the
 

1809
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,109
formalization to make the
uh

1810
00:41:47,109 --> 00:41:47,119
uh
 

1811
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,710
uh
judging clearer clear and and the votes

1812
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:50,720
judging clearer clear and and the votes
 

1813
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,750
judging clearer clear and and the votes
will be made more transparent we will be

1814
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:53,760
will be made more transparent we will be
 

1815
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,109
will be made more transparent we will be
more transparent

1816
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:55,119
more transparent
 

1817
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,309
more transparent
it's like

1818
00:41:56,309 --> 00:41:56,319
it's like
 

1819
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,630
it's like
a scoring a card

1820
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:58,640
a scoring a card
 

1821
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,670
a scoring a card
which

1822
00:41:59,670 --> 00:41:59,680
which
 

1823
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,270
which
used in many many places uh

1824
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:03,280
used in many many places uh
 

1825
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,750
used in many many places uh
many many years

1826
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:05,760
many many years
 

1827
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,390
many many years
the issue the issue here is that

1828
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:08,400
the issue the issue here is that
 

1829
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,190
the issue the issue here is that
you uh intentionally frame

1830
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:11,200
you uh intentionally frame
 

1831
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,550
you uh intentionally frame
and limit

1832
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:12,560
and limit
 

1833
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,069
and limit
the extent to which jurors can judge

1834
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:16,079
the extent to which jurors can judge
 

1835
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,910
the extent to which jurors can judge
and areas i know

1836
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:17,920
and areas i know
 

1837
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,990
and areas i know
exactly so so

1838
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:20,000
exactly so so
 

1839
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,470
exactly so so
that's why i'm against this because you

1840
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:22,480
that's why i'm against this because you
 

1841
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,270
that's why i'm against this because you
directly uh indicate that you should

1842
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:25,280
directly uh indicate that you should
 

1843
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,349
directly uh indicate that you should
should have this area this area and this

1844
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:27,359
should have this area this area and this
 

1845
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,510
should have this area this area and this
area and you should put scores like this

1846
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:29,520
area and you should put scores like this
 

1847
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,990
area and you should put scores like this
so this

1848
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,000
so this
 

1849
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,270
so this
just

1850
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:33,280
just
 

1851
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,990
just
seems very good but in fact what it does

1852
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,000
seems very good but in fact what it does
 

1853
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,870
seems very good but in fact what it does
it

1854
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:36,880
it
 

1855
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,829
it
restricts uh jurors to certain

1856
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:39,839
restricts uh jurors to certain
 

1857
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,670
restricts uh jurors to certain
judging behavior

1858
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:41,680
judging behavior
 

1859
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,550
judging behavior
and

1860
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:42,560
and
 

1861
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,790
and
if they for example see that for example

1862
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:44,800
if they for example see that for example
 

1863
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,589
if they for example see that for example
you have a good uh work yeah but it has

1864
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:47,599
you have a good uh work yeah but it has
 

1865
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,710
you have a good uh work yeah but it has
some drawbacks but in overall

1866
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:50,720
some drawbacks but in overall
 

1867
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,750
some drawbacks but in overall
this work deserves the first place but

1868
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:53,760
this work deserves the first place but
 

1869
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,309
this work deserves the first place but
due to this framework

1870
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:56,319
due to this framework
 

1871
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,790
due to this framework
this work gets low score

1872
00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:58,800
this work gets low score

00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,950

okay i understand you um

1896
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:26,960
okay i understand you um
 

1897
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,190
okay i understand you um
i i'm just thinking about uh the

1898
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:29,200
i i'm just thinking about uh the
 

1899
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,990
i i'm just thinking about uh the
formalization of the criterias written

1900
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,000
formalization of the criterias written
 

1901
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,470
formalization of the criterias written
in the contest proposal but if you think

1902
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:34,480
in the contest proposal but if you think
 

1903
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,750
in the contest proposal but if you think
that uh

1904
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:35,760
that uh
 

1905
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,430
that uh
every judge

1906
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:37,440
every judge
 

1907
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,950
every judge
can

1908
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:38,960
can
 

1909
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,550
can
bring some

1910
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:40,560
bring some
 

1911
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,230
bring some
some his own opinion and that opinion

1912
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:44,240
some his own opinion and that opinion
 

1913
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,430
some his own opinion and that opinion
uh should have an ability to prevail

1914
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:47,440
uh should have an ability to prevail
 

1915
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,910
uh should have an ability to prevail
over the technical requirements i

1916
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:49,920
over the technical requirements i
 

1917
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,910
over the technical requirements i
understand you but not exactly they uh

1918
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:53,920
understand you but not exactly they uh
 

1919
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,150
understand you but not exactly they uh
look there are hard criteria that should

1920
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:56,160
look there are hard criteria that should
 

1921
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,030
look there are hard criteria that should
be met uh by the contest

1922
00:43:59,030 --> 00:43:59,040
be met uh by the contest
 

1923
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,910
be met uh by the contest
but how to interpret the level to which

1924
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:01,920
but how to interpret the level to which
 

1925
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,150
but how to interpret the level to which
this criteria met it should be up to a

1926
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,160
this criteria met it should be up to a
 

1927
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,349
this criteria met it should be up to a
juror

1928
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:05,359
juror
 

1929
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,390
juror
because

1930
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:06,400
because
 

1931
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,790
because
if it's written uh in hot criteria that

1932
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:08,800
if it's written uh in hot criteria that
 

1933
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,630
if it's written uh in hot criteria that
you should put a smiling face on the

1934
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:10,640
you should put a smiling face on the
 

1935
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,670
you should put a smiling face on the
page

1936
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:11,680
page
 

1937
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,230
page
you can just take the first shitty

1938
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:14,240
you can just take the first shitty
 

1939
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,230
you can just take the first shitty
smiley uh from the internet and put it

1940
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:16,240
smiley uh from the internet and put it
 

1941
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,550
smiley uh from the internet and put it
there or draw it by your hand and make

1942
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:18,560
there or draw it by your hand and make
 

1943
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,829
there or draw it by your hand and make
it organically uh integrated into the

1944
00:44:20,829 --> 00:44:20,839
it organically uh integrated into the
 

1945
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:22,230
it organically uh integrated into the
page uh

1946
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:22,240
page uh
 

1947
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,829
page uh
both of them are technically met

1948
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:23,839
both of them are technically met
 

1949
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,589
both of them are technically met
requirements

1950
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:25,599
requirements
 

1951
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,349
requirements
and uh if you directly indicate that uh

1952
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:29,359
and uh if you directly indicate that uh
 

1953
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,190
and uh if you directly indicate that uh
you should indicate

1954
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:31,200
you should indicate
 

1955
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,309
you should indicate
binary uh for example that it's met or

1956
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:34,319
binary uh for example that it's met or
 

1957
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,790
binary uh for example that it's met or
not yeah so it's it's not like not

1958
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:36,800
not yeah so it's it's not like not
 

1959
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,230
not yeah so it's it's not like not
working like this

1960
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:38,240
working like this
 

1961
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,230
working like this
and believe me there are hundreds of

1962
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:40,240
and believe me there are hundreds of
 

1963
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,950
and believe me there are hundreds of
different criteria in a juror's mind

1964
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:42,960
different criteria in a juror's mind
 

1965
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,710
different criteria in a juror's mind
when he's assessing this work he's

1966
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:44,720
when he's assessing this work he's
 

1967
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,829
when he's assessing this work he's
comparing

1968
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:45,839
comparing
 

1969
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,069
comparing
different solutions with each other and

1970
00:44:48,069 --> 00:44:48,079
different solutions with each other and
 

1971
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:48,870
different solutions with each other and
uh

1972
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:48,880
uh
 

1973
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,150
uh
that's why i'm saying it's it's not

1974
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:50,160
that's why i'm saying it's it's not
 

1975
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,069
that's why i'm saying it's it's not
prohibited to recommend

1976
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:52,079
prohibited to recommend
 

1977
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,109
prohibited to recommend
some approaches and i believe that over

1978
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:55,119
some approaches and i believe that over
 

1979
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,710
some approaches and i believe that over
the time so we will get some kind of uh

1980
00:44:58,710 --> 00:44:58,720
the time so we will get some kind of uh
 

1981
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,630
the time so we will get some kind of uh
good good practice

1982
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:00,640
good good practice
 

1983
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,589
good good practice
yes i think yes i think that we can

1984
00:45:03,589 --> 00:45:03,599
yes i think yes i think that we can
 

1985
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,109
yes i think yes i think that we can
somehow join two approaches uh because

1986
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:07,119
somehow join two approaches uh because
 

1987
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,150
somehow join two approaches uh because
um

1988
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:08,160
um
 

1989
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,190
um
the proposed approach uh makes much more

1990
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:11,200
the proposed approach uh makes much more
 

1991
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,109
the proposed approach uh makes much more
transparency to

1992
00:45:13,109 --> 00:45:13,119
transparency to
 

1993
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,670
transparency to
some of them absolutely for the tremor

1994
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:15,680
some of them absolutely for the tremor
 

1995
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,230
some of them absolutely for the tremor
transmission don't get me wrong okay i'm

1996
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:18,240
transmission don't get me wrong okay i'm
 

1997
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,950
transmission don't get me wrong okay i'm
just against the uh tight in the hands

1998
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:20,960
just against the uh tight in the hands
 

1999
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,430
just against the uh tight in the hands
of each uh

2000

yes of course we we should

make
we should

00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:30,319
we should
 

2009
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:33,750
we should
leave the ability for for judges to

2010
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:33,760
leave the ability for for judges to
 

2011
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,950
leave the ability for for judges to
uh make their own decision and uh

2012

uh if they think for example that some

2020
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:45,520
uh if they think for example that some
 

2021
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,230
uh if they think for example that some
solution will not work in real life i

2022
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:48,240
solution will not work in real life i
 

2023
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,829
solution will not work in real life i
understand absolutely

2024
00:45:49,829 --> 00:45:49,839
understand absolutely
 

2025
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,870
understand absolutely
and we i think that we should postpone

2026
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:52,880
and we i think that we should postpone
 

2027
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,190
and we i think that we should postpone
this very complex question to the next

2028
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:55,200
this very complex question to the next
 

2029
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,550
this very complex question to the next
meeting or so

2030
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:56,560
meeting or so
 

2031
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,190
meeting or so
and think about how we can improve

2032
00:45:59,190 --> 00:45:59,200
and think about how we can improve
 

2033
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,430
and think about how we can improve
really improve and make a step forward

2034
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:01,440
really improve and make a step forward
 

2035
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,030
really improve and make a step forward
in fact

2036
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,040
in fact
 

2037

2051
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,150
by you guys but yeah i i think that we
can we can easily combine two approaches

2052
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:18,160
can we can easily combine two approaches
 

2053
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,670
can we can easily combine two approaches
to leave

2054
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:19,680
to leave
 

2055
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,870
to leave
um

2056
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:20,880
um
 

2057
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,109
um
some space for interpretation for each

2058
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:23,119
some space for interpretation for each
 

2059
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,750
some space for interpretation for each
other individually and also give them a

2060
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:25,760
other individually and also give them a
 

2061
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,190
other individually and also give them a
framework and

2062
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:27,200
framework and
 

2063
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,829
framework and

different uh contests that were
overlapping and they really had very

2074
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:40,160
overlapping and they really had very
 

2075
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,390
overlapping and they really had very
small amount of time well very little

2076
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:42,400
small amount of time well very little
 

2077

to
 

2081
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,870
to
assess everything and uh the solutions

2082
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:46,880
assess everything and uh the solutions
 

2083
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,990
assess everything and uh the solutions
are really complex so if there is some

2084
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:50,000
are really complex so if there is some
 

2085
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,670
are really complex so if there is some
sort of like a framework that allows

2086
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:51,680
sort of like a framework that allows
 

2087
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,630

uh to
 

2091
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,230
uh to
get basic uh understanding uh of

get basic uh understanding uh of
 

2093
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,190
get basic uh understanding uh of
the hard criteria and of how hard and

2094
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:01,200
the hard criteria and of how hard and
 

2095
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,990
the hard criteria and of how hard and
soft criteria are met and then also add

2096
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,000
soft criteria are met and then also add
 

2097
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,030

some
subjective opinion from them maybe it

2102
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:08,480
subjective opinion from them maybe it
 

2103
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,710
subjective opinion from them maybe it
will be easier and faster for them and

2104
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:10,720
will be easier and faster for them and
 

2105
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,750
will be easier and faster for them and
uh less complex for them to and less

2106
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:13,760
uh less complex for them to and less
 

2107
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,470

because because we know it on the
 

2375
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,230
because because we know it on the
application level and we know it's on

00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:20,240
application level and we know it's on
 

2377
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,349
application level and we know it's on
the let's say ssi level and

2378
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:23,359
the let's say ssi level and
 

2379
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,990
the let's say ssi level and
but we need to go deeply on the level of

00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:26,000
but we need to go deeply on the level of
 

2381
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,829
but we need to go deeply on the level of
the core level of the working with the

there are different rules okay we can

2576
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:16,480
there are different rules okay we can
 

2577
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,270
there are different rules okay we can
discuss it later because it's very very

2578

uh important to to educate people about
 

2581
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,109
uh important to to educate people about
the the the real implementation

2582
00:56:25,109 --> 00:56:25,119
the the the real implementation
 

2583
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,190
the the the real implementation
and vlad

2584
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:27,200
and vlad
 

2585
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,589

identity identity is is actually the

2612
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:04,480
identity identity is is actually the
 

2613
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,470
identity identity is is actually the
basic infrastructure layer so if you

2614
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:06,480
basic infrastructure layer so if you
 

2615
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,349
basic infrastructure layer so if you
remember so we discussed already

2616
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:09,359
remember so we discussed already
 

2617
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:13,109
remember so we discussed already
in some previous calls that

2618
00:57:13,109 --> 00:57:13,119
in some previous calls that
 

2619
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,109
in some previous calls that
right now we are still building the

2620
00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:15,119
right now we are still building the
 

2621
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,950
right now we are still building the
basics so and

2622
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:16,960
basics so and
 

2623
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,030
basics so and
these basics are needed to

2624
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:21,040

 

2625
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,750

let us create some more high level

2626
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:23,760
let us create some more high level
 

2627
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,829
let us create some more high level
solutions like for example uh

2628
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:27,839
solutions like for example uh
 

2629
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,710
solutions like for example uh
uncollateralized credits so that

2630

uncollateralized credits so that
 

2631
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,630
uncollateralized credits so that
requires some scoring models that

2632
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:32,640
requires some scoring models that
 

2633
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,750
requires some scoring models that
require

2634
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:33,760
require
 

2635
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,470
require
uh some better knowledge about the

2636
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:36,480
uh some better knowledge about the
 

2637
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,950
uh some better knowledge about the
person and making sure that

2638
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:38,960
person and making sure that
 

2639
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,030
person and making sure that
this person has attraction on his

2640

this person has attraction on his
history uh

2642
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:42,880
history uh
 

2643
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,589
history uh
and for all for example if we would like

00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,589
years already and
with ssi frameworks uh the website can

2676
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:25,599
with ssi frameworks uh the website can
 

2677

2749
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,910
in in dubai in the last events and we
shortly spoke with them about how to

2750
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:47,920
shortly spoke with them about how to
 

2751
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,309
shortly spoke with them about how to
combine is it with the free tone

2752
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:50,319
combine is it with the free tone
 

2753
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:51,430
combine is it with the free tone
activities

2754
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:51,440
activities
 

2755
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,510
activities
with the the standard implementation

2756
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:53,520
with the the standard implementation
 

2757
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,109
with the the standard implementation
with european it should be very

2758
00:59:55,109 --> 00:59:55,119
with european it should be very
 

2759
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,670
with european it should be very
interesting as well as estonia is a part

2760
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:57,680
interesting as well as estonia is a part
 

2761
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,069
interesting as well as estonia is a part
of the european union and probably we

2762
01:00:00,069 --> 01:00:00,079
of the european union and probably we
 

2763
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,549
of the european union and probably we
can find some use case or prototyping

2764
01:00:02,549 --> 01:00:02,559
can find some use case or prototyping
 

2765
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,430
can find some use case or prototyping
there i just wanted to say that uh this

2766
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:05,440
there i just wanted to say that uh this
 

2767
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,270
there i just wanted to say that uh this
is a good opportunity for freetown to

2768
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:07,280
is a good opportunity for freetown to
 

2769
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,910
is a good opportunity for freetown to
become

2770
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:09,920

 

2771
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,670

to find some

2772
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:11,680
to find some
 

2773
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,829
to find some
application uh

2774
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:13,839
application uh
 

2775
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:16,789
application uh
not only for financial purposes and

2776
01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:16,799
not only for financial purposes and
 

2777
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,430
not only for financial purposes and
if return becomes the blockchain

2778
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:19,440
if return becomes the blockchain
 

2779
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,349
if return becomes the blockchain
the blockchain that is used by

2780
01:00:21,349 --> 01:00:21,359
the blockchain that is used by
 

2781
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:25,030
the blockchain that is used by
government governments for

2782
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:25,040
government governments for
 

2783
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,829
government governments for
just ssi purposes so it's i think it

2784
01:00:27,829 --> 01:00:27,839
just ssi purposes so it's i think it
 

2785
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:29,430
just ssi purposes so it's i think it
will be a huge win for the whole

2786
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:29,440
will be a huge win for the whole
 

2787
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,349
will be a huge win for the whole
blockchain the for follow of the

2788

one good use case it's the
 

2835
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,030
one good use case it's the
uh crypto developer let's say or

enough money in crypto and they trying
 

2851
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,710
enough money in crypto and they trying
to keep the anonymity and so on and but

bring this idea and say let's let's talk

2858
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:53,440
bring this idea and say let's let's talk
 

2859
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,109
bring this idea and say let's let's talk
about that because the

2860
01:01:55,109 --> 01:01:55,119
about that because the
 

2861
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:57,109
about that because the
number of people who are developing in

number of people who are developing in
 

2863
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,910
number of people who are developing in
the ethereum let's say and they we

2864
01:01:59,910 --> 01:01:59,920
the ethereum let's say and they we
 

2865

01:02:04,549 --> 01:02:04,559
the free tone let's say but let's start
 

2869
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,589
the free tone let's say but let's start
the platform to attract them for it's

2870
01:02:07,589 --> 01:02:07,599
the platform to attract them for it's
 

2871
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,349
the platform to attract them for it's
for sure you should blockchain agnostic

2872
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:09,359
for sure you should blockchain agnostic
 

2873
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,829
for sure you should blockchain agnostic
i mean that that stuff of uh end user

2874
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:11,839
i mean that that stuff of uh end user
 

2875
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:14,309
i mean that that stuff of uh end user
portal and so on but another one good

2876
01:02:14,309 --> 01:02:14,319
portal and so on but another one good
 

2877
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:15,910
portal and so on but another one good
use case

2878
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:15,920
use case
 

2879
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:16,630
use case
so

2880
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:16,640
so
 

2881
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,829
so

i don't know the
 

2887
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,549
i don't know the
cv etc but never mind it's a little bit

2888
01:02:26,549 --> 01:02:26,559

2889
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,270

later in the prototyping in august or

2890
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:29,280
later in the prototyping in august or
 

2891
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,510
later in the prototyping in august or
something and now it's the phase to

2892
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:31,520
something and now it's the phase to
 

2893
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,589
something and now it's the phase to
develop the methods

2894
01:02:33,589 --> 01:02:33,599
develop the methods
 

2895
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,549
develop the methods
