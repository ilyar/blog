1
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,160
okay mika welcome and the first question

2
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,400
is why wasn't it possible to create a

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,119
git on chain before why it wasn't

4
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,238
possible to put an existing git on a

5
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,239
blockchain for on ever scale or some

6
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,000
other blockchain why we decided to

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,680
create a totally new brand new

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,920
blockchain for kit

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,960
yeah it's a it's this the answer is like

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,520
has to there are two answers for that uh

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,039
one is technical which i don't want to

12
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,920
go right now into because we have a show

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,600
about economics

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,520
uh so let's talk about

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,559
the other

16
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:57,520
reason

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,800
and this reason is into economics

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,559
so as you as you all know

19
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,640
anything you do on any blockchain

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,159
costs some money

21
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,640
yeah sometimes called fees or gas

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,320
whatever

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,200
and

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,439
there is no model today

25
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,560
um

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,520
like no economic model today on the

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,720
blockchain

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,479
which permits you to do something for

29
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,240
free

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,280
you always pay for anything you do

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,360
and the reason why you pay

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,320
um is partly

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,840
um

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,640
protection against spam so

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,159
because if if you would start um

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,479
you know producing millions of

37
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,240
transactions for free

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,560
then you would stop a blockchain

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,159
you could stop a blockchain because

40
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,240
there is no unlimited capacity on any

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,320
blockchain and and any computing system

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,759
so sometimes uh what other projects

43
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,960
trying to do is for example solana

44
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,200
just just they make the fees very very

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,719
small

46
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,680
like

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,960
so small

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,040
that it's almost like you don't almost

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,560
no don't feel it

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,000
the problem there are two problems for

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,480
that first it's still

52
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,000
a fee so you still has have to buy right

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,080
tokens even if it's a small amount of

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,360
tokens

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,200
yeah you still need to buy it so it's

56
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,280
not free even if it's so it's small

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,160
small

58
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,120
um

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,000
but the other the other thing is that

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,920
it doesn't protect against spam

61
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,360
and we saw that solana

62
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,760
experienced many problems related to

63
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,959
this

64
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,519
where the full capacity was used it

65
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,959
doesn't matter if you if you don't have

66
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,879
unlimited capacity basically there is

67
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,640
some limit there is some price that

68
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,519
someone can pay to buy out

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,360
the whole blockchain basically which

70
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,680
means the blockchain will exclusively

71
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,040
work for this

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,280
someone and that means that the

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,879
blockchain will stop for everyone else

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,800
so

75
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,519
i think one of the most important the

76
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,840
contributions to tokenomics

77
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,440
in gosh is that

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,200
we came out

79
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,680
came up with the possibility to make a

80
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,959
completely free service on the

81
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,159
blockchain

82
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,159
and right because

83
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,440
again

84
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,680
a sorry to interrupt you because a git

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,760
for those who don't maybe so those who

86
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,599
don't know here uh a git is a free

87
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,599
service developers using git it's a free

88
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,640
service so

89
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,720
for open source yeah put

90
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,640
yeah for open source it's okay well

91
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,280
okay so git is not a service git is

92
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,360
something you install on your computer

93
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,720
where you basically store your code and

94
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,799
all the versions of your code

95
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,840
right

96
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,599
when you talk about service you talk

97
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,400
something like github or gitlab or

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,280
bitbucket whatever there are like right

99
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,239
a git hosting platform exactly so when

100
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,159
we talk about git costing platform yeah

101
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,040
and these platforms it doesn't it's not

102
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,959
only relates to git

103
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,000
it relates to any um well most of the

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,840
business models today when you have

105
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,480
cloud service usually this cloud service

106
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,840
provides you some um some

107
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,120
service for free it's like like initial

108
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,399
some amount of

109
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,238
whatever service they they give they

110
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,079
provided for free so for example like

111
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,918
firebase

112
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:22,720
or

113
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,320
you know aws you could you could have

114
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,240
like a small server from aws

115
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
for free just to try it out

116
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,160
just to build your application to test

117
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,040
your application and then

118
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,560
when you scale like when you have a lot

119
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,000
of users you start to have a lot of

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,840
users

121
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,639
then

122
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,639
you know you start paying and this is a

123
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,120
normal business model which which makes

124
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,680
it very easy to start developing on this

125
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,160
cloud service this model is used

126
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,840
everywhere right

127
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,639
so when you want to build a

128
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,800
blockchain based

129
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,400
service a cloud service for git

130
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,000
you must accommodate this you must

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,320
accommodate the developers who just want

132
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,759
to start for free

133
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,759
okay mita um let's see the your the

134
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,320
scheme of the tokenomics of gosh like

135
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,120
and you can describe briefly for us like

136
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,280
uh how it works like and then we're

137
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,720
gonna

138
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,880
uh go deeper and see like the details

139
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,080
sure well

140
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,440
as you said there are like two tokens

141
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,440
uh in in in gosh system uh one token is

142
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,240
stable coin and another token is like

143
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,720
value capturing token so the stable coin

144
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,080
called shell

145
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,039
and the

146
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,880
the value capturing token

147
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,160
called gosh

148
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,840
so

149
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,400
there is a reason why

150
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,680
um

151
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,160
why there are two tokens

152
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,280
and again

153
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,360
i don't want to go deeper into that a

154
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,400
lot

155
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,280
but just a couple of words yeah it's

156
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,680
impossible can you briefly cover yeah

157
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,400
yeah it's impossible to

158
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,720
to have one token which both captures

159
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,840
value

160
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,400
and has a property of

161
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,520
money which is like used to

162
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,120
pay for things

163
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,520
okay why it is important why it is not

164
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,280
possible is because

165
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,759
when you pay for stuff

166
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,840
you don't want

167
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,560
i would say this you would be

168
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,720
like inclined not to pay

169
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,960
if with something that rises in value

170
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,600
all the time right if for example if the

171
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,800
dollar

172
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,600
would

173
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,680
rise in value instead of falling like it

174
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,039
will if it would be just complete

175
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,120
deflation all the time instead of

176
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,280
inflation you would have deflation like

177
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,319
10 a year deflation think about that so

178
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,960
you know that what your dollar that you

179
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,520
can buy a coffee today tomorrow you can

180
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,919
buy two two cups of coffee

181
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,440
that would prevent people

182
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
psychologically from spending that

183
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,800
dollar

184
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,400
right because like who would spend

185
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,599
dollars if it's always rises in value

186
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,199
so that's why

187
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,440
inflation is actually

188
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,520
good for economic growth

189
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,639
as we know

190
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,919
it's exactly because of that that

191
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,680
stimulates

192
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,000
spending it stimulates people to get rid

193
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,319
of money to basically put money in

194
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,960
somewhere where the value is created for

195
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,440
example in enterprises take money is a

196
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,360
loan because what you take today and you

197
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,960
can use this loan to create your

198
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,080
business tomorrow you will pay less

199
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,840
when you repay the loan despite the fact

200
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,280
that it has

201
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,080
also percentage you know on the loan but

202
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,199
still you you can you easy you you take

203
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,680
the money and invest the money

204
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,919
easier in something in property for

205
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,400
example also just for whatever you

206
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,080
believe it will will rise in there right

207
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,960
right

208
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,520
right in bitcoin

209
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,280
well that's exactly what's happening

210
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,560
right people investing money

211
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,800
for example something that will rise in

212
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,400
value so people believe something will

213
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,879
rise in value so bitcoin people believe

214
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,720
will rise in value sometimes and they

215
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,879
they buy bitcoin with dollar they

216
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,360
exchange well sometimes

217
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,759
sometimes they don't they lose

218
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,000
believe in everything when the economic

219
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,479
downturn they don't believe but it it

220
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,639
corrects the moment right

221
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,800
right but it corrects itself it corrects

222
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,240
itself also if you look at the like

223
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,560
bitcoin price

224
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,840
it's still 20 000 per bitcoin not

225
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,759
what it was two years ago remember two

226
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,080
years ago it was like much less

227
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,399
right so still despite the fact okay it

228
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,880
went to 60 whatever and then at fall

229
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,799
doesn't matter it's still the basic

230
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,479
value rises

231
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,480
despite the fact that a lot of growing

232
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,959
yeah a lot of people sell it but because

233
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,800
but because well a lot of people will

234
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,399
sell because they feel pressure for

235
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,200
example they have some position

236
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,880
which which they need to cover for

237
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
example and they they oblige to sell

238
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,560
this bitcoin

239
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,800
because whatever but

240
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,680
okay

241
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,320
all right point is the point is we we

242
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,519
need to have two tokens if we want

243
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,000
one talking to ryzen value and we want

244
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,839
also to have token with with which

245
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,959
people would be like ready to pay

246
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,560
each other for work or for some services

247
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,720
and that token need to be

248
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,560
stable and actually if you remember

249
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,680
facebook

250
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,920
tried to do their own cryptocurrency

251
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,920
like this cryptocurrency was supposed to

252
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,839
be stable coin

253
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:30,959
right

254
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,360
and the reason for that is this nothing

255
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,160
but nothing is stable right

256
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,320
it's even the table is relative term

257
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,399
stable is relative to term actually it's

258
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,160
not stable it's losing value it should

259
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,240
lose the value in the perception people

260
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,880
should perceive that as losing value so

261
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,959
for example we know one thing that for

262
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,480
certain will lose value it's called

263
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,760
dollar

264
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,360
dollar is a great

265
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,600
losing value mechanism

266
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,680
and uh and so if you tight your

267
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,480
stablecoin to the dollar

268
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,160
term then

269
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,680
kind of we know that it will lose value

270
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,000
okay

271
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,760
so you need one uh one token to increase

272
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,600
in value so people are going to be

273
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,360
holding it basically right and the other

274
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,440
one who that they will be using for the

275
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,680
transaction so that's they will they

276
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,920
will use the brushes as well i can okay

277
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,360
so let's talk about how they can use

278
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,720
gold let's talk about uh tokens

279
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,320
yeah that's right so why do we need

280
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,120
gauche we already have stable coin and

281
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,920
the we need gosh for governance

282
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,440
and governance

283
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,640
is

284
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,600
when

285
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,519
you can

286
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,880
like vote

287
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,200
for things you can influence things by

288
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,880
just holding kosh

289
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,320
so when we say

290
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,680
uh holding like

291
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,440
you kind of have a part this is the

292
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,880
the mechanism

293
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,000
or the the unit of account

294
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,040
for

295
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,920
what your portion

296
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,519
like personally

297
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,880
that you hold in gosh project

298
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,079
is it kind of uh like a stakeholding uh

299
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,760
it is a state

300
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,399
exactly it is a stakeholding

301
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,320
it is it is it is a stakeholding in

302
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,760
gauche project and the stakeholding

303
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,399
it has several implications

304
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,880
one of them is that it is a mechanism

305
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,680
for

306
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,079
voting for whatever decisions someone

307
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,680
need to make

308
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,360
within the system

309
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,200
for gosh for example so for example

310
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,360
let's say the gosh is run by some

311
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,519
software and we want to change that

312
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,279
software we want to release some

313
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,440
upgrades some update or whatever

314
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,519
and who is going to decide if we're

315
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,920
releasing this update or not

316
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,800
people developers

317
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,600
yeah developers and investors or whoever

318
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,079
hold the stakeholders who hold gosh they

319
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,440
are the one that the most affected by

320
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,360
the decisions that the gosh as a network

321
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
as a project takes

322
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,519
and so they need to have an influence

323
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,360
over this decision and the influence is

324
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,040
measured by the amount of tokens they

325
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,399
hold

326
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,200
the thing is that

327
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,639
in order to encourage the holding

328
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,800
because when we talk about stablecoin we

329
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,639
encourage the spending when we talk

330
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,560
about governance tokens we encourage the

331
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,720
holding this in order to encourage the

332
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,480
whole thing you need this do you need

333
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,880
the value of the talk and not to fall at

334
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,000
least

335
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and for it not to fall it should

336
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,600
actually rise

337
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,839
we know that so it's like an alice in

338
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,240
the wonderland remember i need to run

339
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,000
just to be in place so

340
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,200
uh

341
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,279
it need to rise and in order for it to

342
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,519
rise there is only one mechanism

343
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,480
that

344
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,120
because the price is is it is a demand

345
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,120
is a curve between demand and supply so

346
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,360
if we have some demand for talking the

347
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,600
only reason it will rise in value if you

348
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,440
have a demand is that the supply will be

349
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,680
limited it will be less than the demand

350
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
so that will rise that something will

351
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,240
rise and value like in bitcoin

352
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,120
you have you know in existence like 21

353
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,839
million bitcoin will will ever be

354
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,200
more or less mined and that means that

355
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,320
the demand for bitcoin supposedly to be

356
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,800
rising over time

357
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,240
because more and more people would like

358
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,320
to hold it so the same thing with gosh

359
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,240
the more platform is used the more

360
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,320
developers are joining the more they

361
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,519
would like to hold part of the system so

362
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,760
they can influence the decisions over

363
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,360
the system because this is the system

364
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,800
with their project leaves on and so

365
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,880
for that we need that to rise right

366
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,000
that's very interesting so you're

367
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,680
speaking about people uh you're speaking

368
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,360
about investors who are gonna be uh

369
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,800
whole like who are gonna have

370
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,120
stakeholders speaking about validator

371
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,720
stakeholders

372
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,440
yeah

373
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,600
call them yes whoever you want but it's

374
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,120
interesting because we're now coming to

375
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,880
the validators

376
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,399
program on gosh

377
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,040
so i just uh wanted to ask you a

378
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,320
question that came up to me so

379
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,839
validators are going to be same

380
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,959
stakeholders uh is it correct

381
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,399
correct right

382
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,959
well yeah in order in order to in order

383
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,120
to validate you need to stake

384
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,079
um

385
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,399
that's how it works like always

386
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,639
yeah in any proof of statement

387
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,880
as well

388
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,800
you need to stake you need to hold on to

389
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,120
token because this is the security

390
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,639
guarantee

391
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,639
that you give to the network that if you

392
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,399
as a validator you will do something

393
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,920
malicious then

394
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,399
um you will lose your tokens

395
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,079
so yeah

396
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,839
right okay so now now that we came to

397
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,320
validators uh program i um

398
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,120
i looked into ghost economics so i saw

399
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,680
that basically validators program it's

400
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,920
quite different from what we are usually

401
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,480
used to on other blockchains and that

402
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,199
validators has some advantages and one

403
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,880
of those you just mentioned right that

404
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
uh basically the daters get the ability

405
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,440
to choose on uh on gosh decisions like

406
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,199
to make decisions upon gosh right

407
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,279
because they're gonna have uh

408
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,079
basically okay not not not so quickly

409
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,720
let's let's separate this so first okay

410
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,639
so first let's talk about validation how

411
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,560
you can become a validator validation

412
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,639
program so you need to have gosh okay

413
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,639
you need to put it as a stake and you

414
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,639
need to lock it for

415
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,399
from one to five years

416
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,199
like one two three four four five

417
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,000
um and each the longer you

418
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,959
you

419
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,839
like stake it

420
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,440
the more

421
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
like percentage per year

422
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,759
revenue you will get market starts from

423
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,079
eight percent yeah eight percent first

424
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,839
year up to 24 yearly early return

425
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,519
uh like yield

426
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,839
uh if you if you look at for five years

427
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,519
right so

428
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,920
this is different in a way that it

429
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,279
combines

430
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,120
how the usual like d5 protocols work

431
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,959
with the proof of stake because usually

432
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,040
proof of stake

433
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,279
it's it's simpler than that you just you

434
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,920
know you call you you lock tokens in

435
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,160
steak you stay tokens

436
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,759
and then for the whatever period you

437
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,120
want and then you can exit at any time

438
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,040
right

439
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,240
and uh but but this is um

440
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,480
this model is just just basic proof of

441
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,040
proof-of-stake model but we we didn't

442
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,639
want to do that

443
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,920
because

444
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,639
um

445
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,519
we wanted we wanted to tighter to make

446
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,800
it tighter

447
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,600
the

448
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,519
uh what happens afterwards what you can

449
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,440
do with the token

450
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,480
um

451
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,639
not only just take it and then and then

452
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,320
just take it whenever you whenever you

453
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,959
want because we wanted you to

454
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,360
usually when validators take the token

455
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,279
that's the end of their involvement in

456
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,360
the network because they're only waiting

457
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,680
for yield right they can just take it

458
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,519
and then like they get their advantages

459
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,040
and basically

460
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,680
get the yield whatever it is and yeah

461
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,679
they get them yeah get the money no

462
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,760
advantages i guess i i mean they get

463
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,959
their

464
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,520
money basically essentially money is

465
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,799
advantageous

466
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,480
yeah money is a great advice for them

467
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,439
for sure

468
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,240
yes

469
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,119
absolutely but here uh but on gosh as i

470
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,959
understand that we will get it uh we'll

471
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,119
get a little later on it uh validators

472
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,880
have the ability to stay much longer

473
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,400
than five years if they wish to because

474
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,359
they have

475
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,039
other interesting

476
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,760
features

477
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,360
yeah i think the most important part

478
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,679
here sorry pauline go ahead

479
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,320
i'm sorry like you speak and i will this

480
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,919
is going to be my next question so you

481
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,480
can like talk more about it

482
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,400
all right so um

483
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,440
the thing is that um there is a there is

484
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
a one

485
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,120
covet here

486
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,880
we said

487
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,440
the biggest problem okay is that how you

488
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,840
you need to provide

489
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,760
yield right you need to provide you need

490
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,559
to

491
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,039
issue more tokens for validators to stay

492
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,640
on the network

493
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,160
usually right

494
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,600
you know in any network doesn't matter

495
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,679
proof of stake proof of work right now

496
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,400
validators are validators or miners

497
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,960
they constantly mine and despite the

498
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,440
fact that every four years

499
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,720
the the

500
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,200
mining rewards on on bitcoin for example

501
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,120
halves

502
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,760
the rise of the price make it up

503
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,919
and they still want to mine the next

504
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,919
bitcoin

505
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,080
right it's still economically economical

506
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,840
for them to mine next bitcoin but we

507
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,559
said in the beforehand that we need to

508
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,480
stop the emission

509
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,160
nobody is saying this actually like no

510
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,160
layer one protocol has ever i think said

511
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,919
uh this is the first time that someone

512
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,520
said we will just completely stop the

513
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,360
emission

514
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,600
because in bitcoin how it works they're

515
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,559
like half in like uh

516
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,720
every time like the next bitcoin is like

517
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,120
they get less money like twice less

518
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,799
money than before right that's how it

519
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,280
works but not completely stopped yet

520
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,760
well it will stop it will stop so

521
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,640
but satoshi well it's actually

522
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,520
okay

523
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,760
almost up let's say no no it's it will

524
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,679
stop completely because there will be

525
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,400
point where to my next bitcoin you will

526
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,160
never like you will never mind next

527
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,080
bitcoin it will take you until the end

528
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,640
of the universe to solve the next bus

529
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,919
but

530
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,400
that's okay so so satoshi

531
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,559
what satoshi predicted

532
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,679
um is that on certain day when the

533
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,760
mining will diminish it will be replaced

534
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,880
by

535
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,880
by the fees that someone pays for

536
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,720
transaction fees

537
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,960
okay

538
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,440
so it will be

539
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,760
replaced by transaction fees that the

540
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,120
miner will get

541
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,960
right and that will constitute their

542
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,160
revenue

543
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,280
uh

544
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,679
f from the point where there is there

545
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,799
are no more bitcoins mine

546
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,280
the reason actually mining was even

547
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,520
created in the beginning by satoshi

548
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,480
invented by satoshi's to

549
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,520
simplify the the miners to start the

550
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,919
network to continue support the network

551
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,559
before the level of transaction reaches

552
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,799
a certain point where it no longer will

553
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,559
be necessary to to have that

554
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,840
uh the mining

555
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,720
right

556
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,760
uh in gosh we are trying to compress

557
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,919
that first of all to five years

558
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,360
we will only

559
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,559
issue this amount of tokens

560
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,720
as we said and the amount of tokens

561
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,880
actually locked there are no more than

562
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,440
11 million tokens that will ever be

563
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,320
issued to validators

564
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,240
right yes we forgot to discuss about it

565
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,320
we didn't discuss it yet okay so yes

566
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,240
eleven millions goes to validate i'm not

567
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,720
not talking more so

568
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,400
i i i

569
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,200
might

570
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,880
my question was like okay they like um

571
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,440
lock these tokens for five years

572
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,200
what's next like after five years there

573
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,240
is no like interest in this anymore so

574
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,039
what how are you gonna keep them on uh

575
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,480
of course all right so that's liquidity

576
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,880
providing so we're kind of mixing here a

577
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,120
lot of d5 protocols and um yeah

578
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,679
so so so we're saying the following so

579
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,760
when you stake gosh in validator pool

580
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,720
you can issue for every state gauche you

581
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,600
can issue a token called lv gosh

582
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,480
and you can do two things with lv gosh

583
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,240
you can either

584
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,799
either sorry um

585
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,640
you can either

586
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,039
a vote with this

587
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,840
like participate in governance

588
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,280
or

589
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,200
or you can

590
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,520
provide liquidity

591
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,840
in the decentralized exchange

592
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,960
which is part of the system called gex

593
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,080
and this liquidity is used to support

594
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,760
actually repositories on gosh

595
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,720
which

596
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,559
open source projects or whatever

597
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,640
projects uh build their software on gosh

598
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,400
and they can

599
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,200
list the tokens of their repositories

600
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,679
in the gex repository and the gex uh

601
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,400
decentralized exchange so when you when

602
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,520
when so you can take your staked

603
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,000
token and you can provide liquidity

604
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,400
for different projects

605
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,039
uh with a separate mechanism which i

606
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,120
don't know if we discussed today

607
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,200
but this mechanism allows you like

608
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,440
allows every validator whoever you don't

609
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,240
need to be a validator but you need to

610
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,159
stake your gosh

611
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,559
and get this lv gosh tokens

612
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,720
to provide liquidity for this project

613
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,520
and when you provide liquidity you mine

614
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,000
the project tokens so instead of

615
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,159
transaction fees

616
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:02,799
so

617
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,799
so you basically become an investor

618
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,200
please you are an investor already

619
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,440
when when you invest in when you're

620
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,559
buying a mining farm in bitcoin you're

621
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,520
becoming an investor in bitcoin period

622
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,480
there's no question about it right you

623
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,720
and and the cost of the mining farm is

624
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,080
huge

625
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,200
as you know right so you invest up front

626
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,320
up front

627
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,559
um enormous amount of money

628
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,320
and you cannot sell it that easily

629
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,880
actually right it takes time and effort

630
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,559
to sell the equipment if you want to

631
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,000
exit

632
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,600
and so in a way when bitcoin

633
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,720
miner

634
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,799
kind of mined bitcoin

635
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,640
he staked

636
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,039
his money into bitcoin mining equipment

637
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,760
right improv in proof of stake you just

638
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,400
take that money without buying it equip

639
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,200
like

640
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,720
you have some servers but this is

641
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,320
negligible cost

642
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,039
right so right okay you need to you need

643
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,960
but but but you still it's still you're

644
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,880
still an investor you're an investor in

645
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,360
bitcoin or you invest in proof of stake

646
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,880
as a proof of state validator you still

647
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,880
investor but the question is not if you

648
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,640
invest or not the question is how you

649
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,840
make money on this investment

650
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,919
and if you think about that

651
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,240
just make a mission

652
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,720
it it doesn't make a lot of sense

653
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,840
actually

654
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
like like ethereum works on just

655
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,760
providing a mission like

656
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,840
emitting tokens every year to to

657
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,080
validators right

658
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,200
uh

659
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,240
to to you know for them to and ethereum

660
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,159
by the way will never stop there is no

661
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,520
such thing as as diminishing

662
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,720
mining rewards in ethereum so it's like

663
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,240
constant or whatever

664
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,360
and uh

665
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,799
this

666
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,600
this doesn't make a lot of sense because

667
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,720
um

668
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,400
okay you introduce inflation into the

669
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,640
system which you want to be deflationary

670
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
as we said before you need two tokens

671
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,760
remnants

672
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,440
so it's it's it's a mixed up thing and i

673
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,919
don't think it works actually

674
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,559
like the only thing why it works is

675
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,480
because when you have certain amount of

676
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,600
tokens you participate in kind of having

677
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,120
um

678
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,679
transaction fees as well right and that

679
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,679
gives you

680
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,080
this economical that gives it some

681
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,080
economical sense

682
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,279
but we said here we wanted to let's just

683
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,320
eliminate let's eliminate the mining

684
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,480
that's eliminating the emission

685
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,240
and then let's eliminate the fees for a

686
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,080
second let's just eliminate the fees

687
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,559
from the from the whole equation

688
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,039
now what happens then well if you stake

689
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,720
you're talking if you believe that you

690
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,360
you start to earn some then yield you

691
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,960
believe in the platform you believe in

692
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,360
the gosh price right if you're investor

693
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,120
you believe in gosh price

694
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,600
so you lock the stock in validation give

695
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,520
you a boost we call it staking boost for

696
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,360
five years

697
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,080
11 million tokens

698
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,880
but

699
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,360
then if you want to continue support the

700
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,200
network you actually need to what is the

701
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,840
network what is the value of the network

702
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,600
the value of the network is actually we

703
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,279
believe the value of the of the projects

704
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,520
using this network

705
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,000
all right if you get if your kit on

706
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,640
chain the value of git on chain is in

707
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,880
the projects in the open source

708
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,799
repositories or closed source

709
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,200
repositories which are using this giton

710
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,880
chain for different reasons which we're

711
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,200
not going to discuss today why why they

712
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,799
would use it but

713
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,039
that's not the point okay so if you

714
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,360
believe that people will use this

715
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,679
and or people are using this you can see

716
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,919
that and then

717
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,080
you want to capitalize on them so they

718
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,480
how you capitalize on them

719
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,760
you can take the fees from their

720
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,679
transaction that would usually

721
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,080
doing everyone doing right

722
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,840
but we're saying

723
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,440
right but we're saying

724
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,480
actually

725
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,919
own

726
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,080
part of this project you can own part of

727
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,720
the projects without actually going to

728
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,640
fees you don't need their fees you can

729
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,960
actually own their tokens

730
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,760
and so if the project want to

731
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,039
list their

732
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,159
tokens basically listing means

733
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,720
give it to the hands of investors

734
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,399
so if the project is interested in

735
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,200
getting the they're talking

736
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,279
to the to the hands of investors they

737
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,760
can do that by listing that on gex and

738
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,000
you as an investor validator whatever

739
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,360
you call yourself

740
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,840
you can take your staked tokens

741
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,520
and use it to provide liquidity

742
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,480
basically as a and as a reward for

743
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,559
providing liquidity you get

744
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,480
pieces of the tokens of this

745
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
repositories

746
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,279
right

747
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,200
does it make sense

748
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,360
yeah very interesting

749
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,720
so uh

750
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,200
so projects uh i'm just gonna mention it

751
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,120
briefly so basically projects will have

752
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,279
an opportunity to

753
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,799
receive fundings right open source

754
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,200
projects with gosh to economics

755
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,039
they have an ability

756
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,399
it's not only it's it's

757
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,360
not just

758
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,600
it it's not just to receive funding is a

759
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,000
very generalized term because

760
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,520
right you don't necessarily receive

761
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,240
funding okay you can list your talking

762
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,279
tokens

763
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,399
and just

764
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,679
find some buyers even without you

765
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,159
receiving funding directly

766
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,480
so because you just want to you you may

767
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,279
want just to promote a trade of your

768
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,399
token

769
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,919
and so people

770
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,120
that

771
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,399
believe in your projects can participate

772
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,159
by by buying some projects maybe even

773
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,360
not from you

774
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,520
it's like what you do with ipo right so

775
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,039
there is initial public offering where

776
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,039
you sell your talking to investors but

777
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,200
you can list it just without selling it

778
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,760
to investors directly and you just just

779
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,640
can allow everyone who has the token to

780
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,960
list it and then the investors can buy

781
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,399
from them

782
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,399
you not necessarily need to issue tokens

783
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,760
new tokens to

784
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,000
to to investors there is there are

785
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,760
myriads of way to do that

786
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,640
just

787
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,120
so we allow that listing decentralized

788
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
listing of any repository who wishes and

789
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,279
when you create actually when you create

790
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,679
repository on gosh

791
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,279
that the dao

792
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,440
which governed by the token of risk repo

793
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,640
this repository create created uh just

794
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,320
by default

795
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,000
of course you don't need to use this

796
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,200
tokens to sell it or use it as a as a as

797
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,000
a

798
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,039
financial instrument right

799
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,200
but does any token uh so you said a

800
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,240
repository created the organization uh

801
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,799
by itself automatically does any token

802
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,360
that is going to be issued will end up

803
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,279
on gex on the decentralized exchange

804
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,720
can end up okay what are the criteria

805
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,279
just in few words

806
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,520
there are it's basically just what you

807
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,799
want so you as a repository

808
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,919
uh

809
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,440
owner

810
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,039
owner means

811
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,600
your repository is owned by the token

812
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,679
holders of your repository this is the

813
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,360
whole point that's a repository dial so

814
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,880
you as a dao

815
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,480
all token holders

816
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,200
can decide that you want this token be

817
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,080
available on the ax that someone can

818
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,320
sell and buy and sell these tokens of

819
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,799
your repository if you decided this you

820
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,480
vote for this if you decide it's just a

821
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,080
commit and git

822
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,880
uh

823
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,120
okay so just a comment it doesn't

824
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,200
it's just a commit so it's uh it's

825
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,559
actually yeah you just you just create

826
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,520
that commit

827
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,760
there is a metric one metric is it

828
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,279
should be f dao

829
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,399
so

830
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:43,919
okay

831
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,840
f dao means

832
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,840
a fair dial protocol

833
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,440
and that

834
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,840
we have a slide for that i think

835
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,480
so far protocol is is very simple

836
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,039
protocol it basically says that

837
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,960
all the revenues

838
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,760
that the token captures doesn't matter

839
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
whatever revenues there are

840
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,039
and again

841
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,360
if you are an open source repository

842
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,760
let's say and you

843
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,480
have some revenue generated on chain for

844
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,120
example you sell some services around

845
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,360
your repository or something

846
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,159
right um and you sell it

847
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,720
on gosh

848
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,279
and we will discuss i can we will

849
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,679
discuss later when we discuss shell

850
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,840
how you can actually sell it like you

851
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,360
sell today

852
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,480
your services via whatever credit card

853
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,360
so

854
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,159
let's say you sell some services on

855
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,279
on gosh

856
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,240
and

857
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,519
this this

858
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,600
the payment

859
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,480
uh

860
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,880
which is the payment in token

861
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,279
in any token can be shell it can be

862
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,480
anything else

863
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,159
should arrive into some smart contract

864
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,120
which is called efdow reserve

865
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,159
and the efda reserve

866
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,559
it the only way to get this talking out

867
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,440
of the reserve is to sell

868
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,240
some

869
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,720
tokens of your repository some your dow

870
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,760
tokens your project dial tokens

871
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,919
towards this reserve

872
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,519
right so we burn

873
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,760
to burn yeah you burn tokens in the

874
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,440
reserve in exchange you get the

875
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,080
proportional amount of the whatever

876
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,159
accumulated revenues there is in this

877
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,200
contract

878
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,000
this is very interesting dynamic

879
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,200
which basically provides the constantly

880
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,399
rising

881
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,320
if you continue if a repository continue

882
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,039
to sell some services it will constantly

883
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,640
the the reserve

884
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,080
uh

885
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,919
the amount of tokens in reserve the

886
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,120
value in reserve will constantly rise

887
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,519
and because it will never fall because

888
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,600
when you burn tokens so proportionally

889
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,240
to every token it will rise doesn't

890
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,159
matter if you sell

891
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,399
if someone sells or not

892
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,240
right very interesting so so all the

893
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,000
liquidity is going to be uh so basically

894
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,480
everything um backs it's let's say it's

895
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,240
the it's the heart rates that doesn't

896
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,080
realize that change all the tokens are

897
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,039
going to be listed there

898
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,399
you can decide

899
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,840
not all of them

900
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,399
if you're talking as follows the revenue

901
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,880
model of fair dao then you're

902
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,159
automatically

903
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,799
like in enables listing and the only

904
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,279
thing that the only thing that you need

905
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,559
to do

906
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,120
to list apart from ref dao is to have

907
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,120
certain amount of liquidity

908
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,960
and that's exactly so you basically

909
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,240
create commit

910
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,279
in the gex repository

911
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,200
with your talking listing

912
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,519
and the the repository will check

913
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,600
automatically if that's fare down

914
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,320
and if it's fair now it will immediately

915
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,360
create a notification to all lv gosh

916
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,760
talking holders that you can

917
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,240
actually vote for it will start a voting

918
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,279
period

919
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,480
for this

920
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,159
uh you know talking holder salvy gorsh

921
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,080
talking holes to vote for providing

922
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,919
liquidity or not and if they pass the

923
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,480
threshold of this liquidity then it the

924
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,320
token will automatically list my

925
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,239
curiosity everything is going to be

926
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,199
already automatically so if we see that

927
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,440
the project repository

928
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,960
is having a

929
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,879
fair doubt they're having

930
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,480
they're getting uh

931
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,639
things done they're they're selling

932
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,719
right they're selling their service

933
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,520
so automatically as you said all the

934
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,719
holder of the lb gosh token will be

935
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,079
notified so it's everything is going to

936
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,399
be in the system built in already

937
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,440
so it's yeah because because the lv the

938
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,320
lv gosh talk and holders

939
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,079
they have notification they are

940
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,040
automatically subscribed to the

941
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,000
notification of the gosh repository and

942
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,839
gex repository

943
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,040
so

944
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,639
when when the gex

945
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,119
submits the project it commits its

946
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,599
project basically to gex repository

947
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,400
and

948
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,280
uh when it when it's done then everyone

949
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,200
the voting starts automatically

950
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,760
okay interesting so the voting through

951
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,839
soft cooperative voting mechanism right

952
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:12,880
that we

953
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,240
yeah we will not discuss it today but um

954
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,079
so we can discuss it we can discuss it

955
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,680
very briefly

956
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,440
we can go yes please self-copy rating

957
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,240
voting is is a special mechanism

958
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,359
where every token holder vote for the

959
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,560
project

960
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,839
but um they participate proportionally

961
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,400
to their holding so if it passes

962
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,280
threshold then everyone will commit

963
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,560
the percentage of their holding

964
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,760
into the amount that was voted for

965
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,480
so

966
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,839
if you have if if the if the suv

967
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,200
uh voting was for i don't know

968
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,960
providing liquidity

969
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,359
in the range of hundred thousand for

970
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,400
example

971
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,760
uh gosh tokens actually shells because

972
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,000
that's the pair is shell against uh

973
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
against the project talking in this

974
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,560
hundred thousand shells and you have a

975
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,200
hundred thousand participants

976
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,599
which which you know has i don't know

977
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,000
equal amount of tokens they will all

978
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
contribute one token

979
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,599
one gosh

980
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,119
sorry one shell

981
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:19,920
two

982
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,320
to the to the liquidity pair

983
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,960
doesn't matter if some of them voted or

984
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,720
not if the decision collective decision

985
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,960
was such that we allow that

986
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,480
and the collective decision reached the

987
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,079
threshold of hundred thousand for

988
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,880
example tokens then everyone will

989
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,760
automatically commit their token

990
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,000
proportional token holding into this

991
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,760
liquidity

992
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,000
did you decide to make this a particular

993
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,720
model uh what are the benefits because

994
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,119
because this is the model which allows

995
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,079
for

996
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:52,839
a

997
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:56,000
decentralized cooperation

998
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,240
uh where not every participant need to

999
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,000
participate

1000
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,480
because it it provides its answers the

1001
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,880
question how much

1002
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,280
it's it's a quantitative decision you

1003
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,400
can today there are no

1004
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,720
sorry

1005
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,040
um

1006
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,400
today

1007
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,720
there is no voting mechanism

1008
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,800
you can vote yes or no you can reach

1009
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,000
some decision yes or no but

1010
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,119
you cannot reach decision how much

1011
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,880
the quantitative decision there is no

1012
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,800
mechanism we know

1013
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,640
that can reach quantitative decision and

1014
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,880
soft cooperative voting it's based on

1015
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,680
the work that i did with unrelation

1016
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,640
uh

1017
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,560
that um

1018
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,160
that is providing the answer to the

1019
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,240
question how much so if we want to

1020
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,320
decide we're a fund

1021
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,200
we okay so we want to invest we can

1022
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,720
easily create a voting and and say okay

1023
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,440
do we want to invest in this project

1024
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,440
right but then we need to ask how much

1025
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,359
we want to invest in this project so we

1026
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,800
can of course ask the question do we

1027
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,480
want to invest one million in this

1028
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,200
project but let's say what about one

1029
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
million and five

1030
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,280
so do we need additional voting to to

1031
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,280
ask a question do we want to invest one

1032
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,960
million and five

1033
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,960
and so on and so on so it's it's

1034
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,440
basically just there was no mechanism

1035
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,520
right to exactly answer the question how

1036
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,599
much the sm suv

1037
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,240
protocol allows us to

1038
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,960
not only vote for do we want to invest

1039
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,839
but also do we how how much do we want

1040
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,000
to invest

1041
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,640
that's easy soft cup rating food and

1042
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,960
guess what is for quantitative decisions

1043
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,280
on how much how how many and so on and

1044
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,520
so forth when we don't know

1045
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,960
when we have some quantity of something

1046
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,880
we don't know what is the quantity that

1047
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,240
we want to provide

1048
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,240
so if majority voting is for binary

1049
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,880
decisions yes or no but

1050
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,599
with it with it with a twist

1051
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,839
it it solves for

1052
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,160
um participation problem we know that

1053
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,200
suv also sort of soft say

1054
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,680
solves for participation problem

1055
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,520
because again in both of them are

1056
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,119
solving for participation problem for

1057
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,720
different uh

1058
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,560
so what is the problem of participation

1059
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,560
a lot of people just don't want to vote

1060
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,880
they never vote

1061
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,960
on anything they're passive and we know

1062
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,960
that like

1063
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,280
the turnaround of any voting any public

1064
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,520
voting is very low as we know and the

1065
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,960
the more stable the economy the the less

1066
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,280
people participate right we know that

1067
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,400
problem

1068
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,079
so in soft majority voting

1069
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,880
there is a mechanism which allows

1070
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,200
to reach if there is a majority like

1071
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,680
overwhelming majority

1072
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,000
of 10 percent of votes

1073
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,400
let's say if 10 of votes

1074
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,680
everyone says yes then we just say if

1075
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,079
the decision is reached

1076
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,160
okay so ten percent participated there

1077
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,640
is a tragic right

1078
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,079
there it's moving threshold so ten

1079
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,000
percent participated ninety percent

1080
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,319
didn't participate but ten percent

1081
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,319
said yes all of them

1082
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,440
it's it's a yes but if one vote

1083
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,599
said no

1084
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:14,800
then

1085
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,640
we need to wait for more votes

1086
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,680
and

1087
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,160
right and it self-regulates itself until

1088
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,960
it reaches if there is for every yes

1089
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,960
vote there is a no vote then we have a

1090
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
problem here right we cannot decide

1091
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,839
there is no majority super majority

1092
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:32,800
then

1093
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,319
we need to

1094
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,000
basically this will the threshold will

1095
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,640
go will rise to 50

1096
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,960
and then the 51 percent will decide

1097
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,520
like a normal voting but that's not what

1098
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,240
usually happens what usually happens is

1099
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,119
usually like decision is overwhelmingly

1100
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,359
supported or overwhelmingly

1101
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,119
not supported

1102
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,119
so if there is

1103
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,359
uh overwhelming support we don't need to

1104
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,480
wait for 51 to reach that decision

1105
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,960
because statistically actually it is

1106
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,400
almost impossible that 10 of votes said

1107
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
yes no one said no

1108
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,960
but if we will continue voting

1109
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,960
there will be like suddenly majority

1110
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,119
that will say no it will change just

1111
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,000
that's that won't happen okay

1112
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,760
so that's the mechanism this mechanism

1113
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,240
allows for active participants if they

1114
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,319
agree to reach the decision faster

1115
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,480
without waiting for everyone else if

1116
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,200
they don't disagree then they still will

1117
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,760
need to for everyone else to vote until

1118
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
the point where if it's 50 50 by the end

1119
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,720
then the one will will decide

1120
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,880
the last low

1121
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,400
very interesting so so we are talking

1122
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,800
about some majority vote uh voting so

1123
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,680
basically soft majority voting uh who

1124
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,800
will vote i'm just uh

1125
00:41:53,330 --> 00:42:00,480
[Music]

1126
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,520
smv

1127
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,359
for the decisions of the governance of

1128
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,760
the gosh repository the gauche network

1129
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,200
or

1130
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,680
you can stake it and provide liquidity

1131
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,640
with that

1132
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,760
on a cv so there is just one or another

1133
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,119
no you can undo both

1134
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,800
okay so each dow repository

1135
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,880
has its own token which voting mechanism

1136
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,040
do we use here

1137
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,079
smb like like you do on gosh so it's

1138
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,000
it's everything is the same every

1139
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,560
repository by default of course i mean

1140
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,960
you can create your own

1141
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,359
whatever

1142
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,480
or token if you want but

1143
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,319
by default uh when repository spawned

1144
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,680
you you it creates dao with the tokens

1145
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,920
and the token mechanism voting mechanism

1146
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,880
is s smd like like you have on gosh

1147
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,640
repository same thing

1148
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,640
so everyone votes for the smb it's the

1149
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,119
most convenient way

1150
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,599
because again not everyone needs to

1151
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,760
vote

1152
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,280
okay

1153
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,359
okay so um

1154
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,079
coming back to validators as we know

1155
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:12,880
that

1156
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,560
they don't get the transaction fees so

1157
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,480
where these transaction fees are

1158
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,760
actually going

1159
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,000
okay

1160
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,119
so transactions fees

1161
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,119
are paid in shell

1162
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,160
so the the the actual

1163
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,560
so the actual basic token of the network

1164
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,280
is shell talking and obviously

1165
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,280
the reason why is because we want people

1166
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,240
to

1167
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,400
uh you know to make more transactions

1168
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,000
into so we want to encourage the

1169
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,200
the payment of the gas fees and for that

1170
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,359
as we said before we need this token to

1171
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,319
lose value not to raise

1172
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,720
so that's why we use shell for this

1173
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,880
okay so

1174
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,720
everyone who wants to

1175
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,599
use

1176
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,000
gosh

1177
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,560
if they pay they will pay in shell for

1178
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,000
transaction fees

1179
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,800
but as we said in the beginning

1180
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,200
we want to allow some free

1181
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,319
usage

1182
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,560
of the repository

1183
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,280
so every every token is

1184
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,480
every repository has its own token smb

1185
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,880
smv mechanism was used for governance of

1186
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,560
this repository then we talked about

1187
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,880
shell token and the transaction fees

1188
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,200
transaction fees

1189
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,880
are paid in shell because we want to

1190
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,359
encourage people to transact more and

1191
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,280
for that we want the token that they pay

1192
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,200
for transaction fees to lose value and

1193
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,800
that is show

1194
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,680
um but we also want people not to pay

1195
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,280
fees

1196
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,440
so how do we do that

1197
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,040
because remember we started from this

1198
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,560
and we went full cycle now

1199
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,720
so we need to protect against spam

1200
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,720
remember right

1201
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,599
and

1202
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,200
this was unsolvable up until now

1203
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,520
we created something called

1204
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,160
free service area and the free service

1205
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,440
area

1206
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,119
is

1207
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,839
the area where if the smart contract is

1208
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,760
placed in this area

1209
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,520
this smart contract

1210
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,520
uh can transact

1211
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,359
with in other smart contracts in the

1212
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,319
free service area only

1213
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,640
for free without fees

1214
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,680
now there are limits to this

1215
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,119
like in every

1216
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,280
think of like

1217
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,280
in in aws

1218
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,480
the

1219
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,040
the server that you buy for free

1220
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,280
you take for free you start for free has

1221
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,160
limits

1222
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,359
you cannot scale to a million customers

1223
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:49,200
in in fire base you have some limits on

1224
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,680
how many queries you can you know make

1225
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,160
or writes you can do to the database

1226
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,560
so we will have the same limits

1227
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,240
so basically you have some limits that

1228
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,599
these contracts are operating on

1229
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,200
beyond that limits you need to pay fees

1230
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,760
yeah to use the service which is i think

1231
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,760
exactly what what is expected from such

1232
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,720
service

1233
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,319
but before that limit

1234
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,400
you can spend as much you want and you

1235
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,240
can create as many accounts free

1236
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,920
accounts as you want of course

1237
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,680
like

1238
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,359
um

1239
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,240
and but you cannot extract the value out

1240
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,760
of it

1241
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,040
basically

1242
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,560
if you just create these accounts to

1243
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,599
um

1244
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,119
you cannot game the system meaning that

1245
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,800
you won't be able to

1246
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,119
take out the value that is provided in

1247
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,880
the free service area

1248
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,240
out to your wallet and benefit from it

1249
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,040
so this is this is the idea

1250
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,280
and then and and but it also exactly

1251
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,720
well fortunately unfortunately

1252
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,880
yeah but there is one

1253
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,480
more benefit

1254
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,359
in having the free service area enabled

1255
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:07,280
and this is a very interesting one

1256
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,119
because you cannot transit you cannot

1257
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,760
extract because you cannot extract value

1258
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,640
out of these tokens in free service area

1259
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,319
these tokens immediately become

1260
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:21,760
completely utility token

1261
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,599
like just think about that

1262
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,240
there is no speculation here

1263
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,800
in this area so when this token is

1264
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,480
within this area

1265
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,200
it actually pure utility token

1266
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,440
and as a pure utility token it can be

1267
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,119
used solely

1268
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,240
as the unit of account

1269
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,040
right

1270
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,520
it it doesn't it does it it doesn't

1271
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,119
store value

1272
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:50,079
and it doesn't use it used as a as a

1273
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,319
is a value exchange

1274
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,520
so it's not a payment system anymore and

1275
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,920
it's not an investment system anymore

1276
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,319
it's just a unit of account

1277
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,319
now the unit of account

1278
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:05,599
allows you

1279
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,280
to actually

1280
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,280
transact with

1281
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,880
the

1282
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,680
fiat world

1283
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,319
because remember in fiat world like if

1284
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,079
you want to

1285
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,200
transact with dollars

1286
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,240
you

1287
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,000
cannot have

1288
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,760
the speculative part

1289
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,000
which is the investment part and you

1290
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,200
cannot have

1291
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,760
the like payment part the money part

1292
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,319
because then if you have them then the

1293
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,079
regulator

1294
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,599
will tell you wait wait this is

1295
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,000
cryptocurrency

1296
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,400
and if you have a cryptocurrency in

1297
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,240
order to connect the cryptocurrency with

1298
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,200
the fiat world you will need to pass

1299
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,280
through the whole

1300
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,800
bananza

1301
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,319
of

1302
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:58,800
right of the aml kyc what not

1303
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,880
which makes it absolutely impossible

1304
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,640
basically to use it

1305
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,319
if you are not a financial institution

1306
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,520
but

1307
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,079
if we take that out

1308
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,160
we can say it's a utility token meaning

1309
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,319
it is not cryptocurrency anymore

1310
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:17,520
when the token passed to this area

1311
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,599
it becomes utility token not

1312
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,160
cryptocurrency and that allows it to

1313
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,760
immediately be connected to any payment

1314
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,160
gateway and you don't need any kyc ml

1315
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,359
so if you want to take money

1316
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,160
from your customers in a normal way

1317
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,359
through like accepting for example uh

1318
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,480
you know credit card debit card

1319
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,240
you can immediately do that

1320
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,440
and we actually have the payment gateway

1321
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,000
built into the free service area so if

1322
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,839
you want to collect money for your

1323
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,640
repository like for example

1324
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,640
i don't know donations or or anything

1325
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,599
like that for for the someone to use

1326
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,800
that uses your repository or you want to

1327
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,079
you know your customers to pay for

1328
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,319
services that you provide

1329
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,720
you can issue invoices and get the

1330
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,440
payments through this payment gateway to

1331
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,880
the um to the free service area

1332
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,319
well it's quite convenient then you

1333
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:15,760
don't have to

1334
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,640
buy like um you don't have to do that

1335
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,839
extra

1336
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,079
uh thing like to buy like uh

1337
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,119
tokens to pay and so on so yeah exactly

1338
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,280
just that directly use your credit card

1339
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,359
exactly and you don't know it doesn't

1340
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,720
matter how much you pay and you don't

1341
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,599
need to aml kyc services

1342
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,520
and also that's something that's already

1343
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,520
been structured into so i mean

1344
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,680
developers usually do pay with their

1345
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,440
credit cards if it's uh

1346
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,200
for example it's it's

1347
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,960
their business let's say credit card

1348
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,839
right so quite convenient yeah

1349
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,839
shall we sum up shall we open up the

1350
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,960
whole scheme of tokenomics if you can

1351
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,319
show it on your screen and just go

1352
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,800
briefly

1353
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,480
you can

1354
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,960
but we will see it anyway yeah

1355
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,119
yeah i i don't have actually this camera

1356
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,319
because it's it's really big it's

1357
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,559
actually if you take all everything that

1358
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,359
we you can see probably on your screen

1359
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,680
now if you if you can take everything we

1360
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,119
discussed today all the pieces of this

1361
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:14,559
stock economics it's quite complex

1362
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,960
picture but if you take it one by one

1363
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,680
right it's it's a it's a subsystems of

1364
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,200
the whole system

1365
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,839
which make kind of a total

1366
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:25,599
closed system

1367
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,280
of the subsystems but each of the

1368
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,599
subsystems make sense i think

1369
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:30,960
in each other

1370
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,319
different purpose like an engine

1371
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,599
right so very interesting

1372
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,680
i think what we didn't discuss actually

1373
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,440
today is only one thing and that's the

1374
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,720
numbers

1375
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,200
i think that maybe right yeah so i can

1376
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,359
go over this very quickly so the total

1377
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,680
supply of wash tokens

1378
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,640
is 100 million

1379
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,119
okay total amount

1380
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,440
ever be minted

1381
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,160
and

1382
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,880
it may go lower than that actually if

1383
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,119
for example for some reason like

1384
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,440
some some validators will will be less

1385
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,200
validators within this five years i

1386
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,640
don't know why but

1387
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,720
theoretically it could go down because

1388
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,200
it's always up to a certain number

1389
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,000
so

1390
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,920
then there is like

1391
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,599
67 million of these gosh tokens will go

1392
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:20,319
to

1393
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,079
towards the development of the network

1394
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:24,240
and research

1395
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,839
and of the gauche product at the whole

1396
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:26,960
ecosystem

1397
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,240
in general

1398
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,920
and uh

1399
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,040
of course

1400
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,480
then 11 million as we said will go to

1401
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,000
the um

1402
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,160
boost boost

1403
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,680
program

1404
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,319
yeah and then of course there are some

1405
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,880
some tokens that will go into in and be

1406
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,200
sold to people who would like to provide

1407
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,599
support for gore's project

1408
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:52,800
um

1409
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,599
you know and or validators that want to

1410
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:57,440
validate or just people who want to

1411
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,440
participate

1412
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:04,800
right

1413
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,000
well of course it will going to be

1414
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,760
listed on the axes exactly the same

1415
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,440
mechanism as was described today so gosh

1416
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,160
is just another repository on gosh

1417
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,640
because as such it has a dao and his

1418
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,200
token in this token by the decision of

1419
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,200
the dao which is not yet reached of

1420
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,000
course but we will be able to whoever

1421
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,559
has got tokens be able to vote for this

1422
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,400
uh can be listed on gigs and then the

1423
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,760
validators would be able to provide

1424
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,240
liquidity

1425
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,359
okay

1426
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,680
so shall we discuss the pricing on gosh

1427
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,280
maybe it's interesting as well for those

1428
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,000
developers who are watching us today

1429
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,240
well the pricing is is of course

1430
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,240
something which with the prices

1431
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,160
right now it's in the private kind of

1432
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,160
round of financing and uh if the price

1433
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,000
is around three dollars per token

1434
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,280
currently

1435
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,640
um it then if it will be listed then the

1436
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,599
the price will be determined by the

1437
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,319
by obviously by the market

1438
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,960
it is important to mention that

1439
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,079
the 67 million that i have said

1440
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,920
when it goes to ecosystem development

1441
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,960
and everything

1442
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,000
it actually is not released

1443
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,160
at any given moment

1444
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,920
like even if it's issued to some

1445
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,280
developers for example it will go

1446
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,839
towards like a vesting scheme which is a

1447
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,760
five years vesting skin

1448
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,800
which will be released slowly so

1449
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,599
the available tokens on the market will

1450
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,920
be always like

1451
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,119
thin and

1452
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:36,880
the amount of this tokens will grow very

1453
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,720
slowly over five years

1454
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,400
so um

1455
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,440
again

1456
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,839
until the ecosystem balances

1457
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,400
and it balances when

1458
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,559
like we have remember that the last

1459
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,079
stock invested

1460
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:53,680
will be also the last token issued ever

1461
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,880
and that

1462
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,040
will balance the price because again we

1463
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,599
want the token to rise in value because

1464
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,240
it's a it's a value storing token and

1465
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,680
because we want people to participate in

1466
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,440
the ecosystem as we said before you need

1467
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,599
to vote for the repositories you need to

1468
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,400
provide liquidity so we need you to hold

1469
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,680
this tokens

1470
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,839
and in order to do that

1471
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,000
obviously the token expectations of

1472
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,760
price should be that it will capture

1473
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,599
value over time so it will rise over

1474
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:23,440
time and we and in order not to create

1475
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,000
over supply on the market in on any

1476
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,680
point even when we meet the talk and

1477
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,839
then give the talking to developers for

1478
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:32,720
their kind of participation ecosystem

1479
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,400
for example if they commit their

1480
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,920
committees accepted to the gosh

1481
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,480
repository they get some tokens

1482
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,559
and so but these tokens are still vested

1483
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:43,520
over a long period of time five years

1484
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,839
and uh and released you know

1485
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:48,559
slowly

1486
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:49,599
so this

1487
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,079
just coming back to uh gosh in general

1488
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,200
revenue

1489
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,000
model is it a real

1490
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,079
working revenue model so because as we

1491
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,040
know

1492
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,599
today on blockchain we do have probably

1493
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,200
not even one project that has a real

1494
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,839
uh revenue model let's say that

1495
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,880
does give a service let's call it

1496
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,359
we believe that gouache is the only

1497
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:16,160
actually

1498
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,720
real product on the blockchain on any

1499
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,960
blockchain today because the rest of the

1500
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,440
blockchain products are either either

1501
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,559
token

1502
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,559
sale icos

1503
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,280
or um like the

1504
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,480
defy

1505
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,119
on the financial services on top of that

1506
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,359
there are almost no use case

1507
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,680
uh real use case for blockchain we

1508
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,119
believe that gosh is the the largest use

1509
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,040
case up to date

1510
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,200
to the blockchain in general so as such

1511
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,079
it does have you know intrinsic value

1512
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:50,000
in in the in the token itself and the

1513
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,079
prop because that has a product now in

1514
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:53,680
terms of pricing for the gauche itself

1515
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,079
for the gauche products it's very simple

1516
