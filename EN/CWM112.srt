00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,320
cheers

2
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,960
hi alex

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,080
is pablo going to join

4
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,640
oh your audio is very low

5
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,840
oh wait hello hello hello hello

6
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,399
hello

7
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,280
hi everybody

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,399
alrighty

9
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,960
i think maybe eugene you might have to

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,480
mute

11
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,600
getting some weird feedback

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,799
okay

13
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,280
so good day to everybody i hope you're

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,240
all enjoying the summer and uh

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,560
kind of a modest appreciation of the

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
market over the past few days just a

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,960
little bit notably a bitcoin and of

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,360
course ever has been going up a bit

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,000
which is exciting so maybe we will not

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,799
have

21
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,680
a winter this winter

22
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,400
so

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,240
let's look at the agenda and i'm going

24
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,640
to hand it over to our own pavel mr pvp

25
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,600
he's got some strategic updates to share

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,640
with us

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,920
so pavel if you're ready

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,799
yes

29
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,520
hi everyone

30
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,520
we had

31
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,960
i don't know

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,439
fifth uh strategic meeting now they're

33
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,399
called

34
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,040
strategic meetings not uh architectural

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,320
ones

36
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,079
uh last

37
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,640
thursday and we'll have it's this

38
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,959
thursday as well

39
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,640
so there was a presentation of

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,760
smft consensus how it works and

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,480
specification and code

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,760
very least

43
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,400
for actually they were open source

44
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,000
and now

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,959
uh

46
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,720
i mean different developers in our

47
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,040
system they can join testing and they

48
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,760
can

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,760
see

50
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,400
see how it works

51
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,720
uh this is the first

52
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,480
actually this is the first phase of uh

53
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,319
releasing of smft

54
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,920
consensus

55
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,560
so there will be more updates but i

56
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,080
think this is

57
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,920
probably most important at the moment

58
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,040
because

59
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,000
uh

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,760
it was underdeveloped for more than a

61
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,400
year and

62
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,560
it is a big

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,200
chunk of code to be honest

64
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,560
so the same story happened with ramp

65
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,280
it

66
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,720
also was

67
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,440
released in public so ramp

68
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,680
uh

69
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,680
ram software is

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,959
almost

71
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,519
uh ready for production i hope so

72
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,440
because it was interest for quite a

73
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,200
number of months

74
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,799
uh coming to network called rfld

75
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:31,519
uh

76
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,239
now validators they have plans to

77
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,440
launch

78
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,799
the

79
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,400
rfld network

80
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,560
with ram and do

81
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,799
community testing

82
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,120
so will be interesting to see how to

83
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,599
work because before that one leverage

84
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,640
made uh test for ramp

85
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,239
uh protocol

86
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,080
so those are two major

87
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,959
advances in in development and now they

88
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,319
are open for everyone

89
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,799
so now you see that everex

90
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,959
who was doing

91
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,799
stuff during that

92
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,879
year

93
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,879
not only

94
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,280
patching

95
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,798
not for

96
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,120
some minor updates but also was working

97
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,399
on

98
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,600
significant

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,840
updates which were

100
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,960
announced in white paper

101
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,520
what else um

102
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,440
also

103
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,120
probably long waited uh update for

104
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,680
multi-signature contract started last

105
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,639
week

106
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,120
actually the first version of new

107
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,639
multi-signature contact was released

108
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,520
if

109
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
you probably don't know

110
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,280
multi-signature contract was written

111
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,960
before even the launch of network

112
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,840
and this is a great contract i think

113
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,000
because as far as as now due to phone

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,720
modification there were no any problems

115
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,919
with it

116
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,400
but uh it was

117
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,199
now

118
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,639
since compiler

119
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,080
uh

120
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,840
got

121
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,280
30 updates

122
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,720
since that time

123
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,360
uh the code was which was written more

124
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,520
than two years

125
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,080
i don't know two and a half years ago it

126
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,000
is not compatible with the current

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,840
compiler so this is

128
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,120
just

129
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,680
uh just

130
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,240
in the input update there are some

131
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,960
additional

132
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,600
features will be added to

133
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,960
multi-signature contract

134
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,360
for example they will be protection from

135
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,960
replay

136
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,000
uh

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,560
we which means the message to much

138
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,960
signature

139
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,280
should include signature of the

140
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,039
addressee

141
00:05:59,039 --> 00:05:59,919
so

142
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,160
they will not be possible to replay the

143
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,720
message for one contract

144
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,479
for another contact with exactly the

145
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,880
same custodians

146
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,160
which is again not the back of the

147
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,919
contract it's a logical uh

148
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,600
uh

149
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,400
logical issue which was not envisaged uh

150
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,680
when it was designed in first place

151
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,560
uh

152
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,160
yeah so that got it for the test

153
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,240
and hopefully

154
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,560
after some audits will be released in

155
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,199
couple of weeks

156
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,120
this is all folks for major updates we

157
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,360
had

158
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,840
oh great that's a lot of updates thank

159
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,039
you pawel

160
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,199
does anybody on the call have any

161
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,240
questions

162
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,479
anything they'd want to ask

163
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,400
just raise your hand i don't see

164
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,680
anything

165
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,440
okay maybe later on maybe from the

166
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
community we have a call

167
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,039
thanks pavel

168
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,400
so we're going to move on the agenda to

169
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,039
the new academy website so we have

170
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,080
eugene here joining us um he and the

171
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
academy crew have been working hard on

172
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,759
the academy website

173
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,919
and they've also added some interesting

174
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,599
features and he's here to share more

175
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,800
cool

176
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,280
hello hello can you see my name yes i

177
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,240
can

178
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,919
okay so this is a very brief update um

179
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,360
the academy website received a lot of

180
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,319
comments from people some positive some

181
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,280
wishing

182
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,280
for certain changes

183
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,919
and the main criticism of the website

184
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,680
was the difficulty we had with

185
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,639
rebranding it was very hard to

186
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,440
do something with more than 30 videos

187
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,319
that we have we had on the website uh

188
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,479
which mentioned freetom

189
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,199
and uh i have to admit we were unable to

190
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,240
clean it all up so uh just too time

191
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,319
consuming to complicate it so what we

192
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,120
did is we created the brand new website

193
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,000
at the moment and you see the address in

194
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,199
its chat

195
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,879
uh it is

196
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,879
nft.everscale.academy.explorer

197
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,960
and in fact this is a full-blown

198
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,840
marketplace uh nft marketplace what we

199
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,919
decided to do is to work with a very

200
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,240
different concept than before

201
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,840
uh we took uh only uh directly relevant

202
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,560
courses uh and added some new ones

203
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,479
particularly from government blockchain

204
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,960
association the standard course uh the

205
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,799
first module we already have that they

206
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,839
teach

207
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,200
and um we decided to simply uh

208
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,440
offer them for sale either through

209
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,559
direct sale or through auctions

210
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,200
and only the courses that deal directly

211
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,880
with blockchain

212
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,920
so at the moment what you see is an mvp

213
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,720
uh we have i believe um alex here on the

214
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,160
call who was a major contributor

215
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,480
to this and essentially

216
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,200
we are a standalone platform platform

217
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,560
right now

218
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,160
so um we will be working to improve uh

219
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,959
this in the near future uh by adding

220
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,680
courses by adding functionality

221
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,920
but essentially uh the mechanism has

222
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,320
changed uh there's no uh mention a

223
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,959
single dimension of freetown anywhere uh

224
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,519
addressing the comments that we received

225
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,120
and we

226
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,920
expect and just to remind everyone uh

227
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,360
the academy is

228
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,959
one of the oldest existing english

229
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,959
speaking groups

230
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,560
in our community

231
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,040
it has not missed a single weekly

232
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,839
meeting since it started

233
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,200
yes we worked there every wednesday

234
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,680
at 11 a.m new york time

235
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,240
and the audience of academy is very

236
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,800
broad today it includes people from

237
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,040
about 11 countries

238
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,440
so uh we encourage of course people come

239
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,279
take a look at mvp provide us with

240
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,640
further comments

241
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,800
and we will be back when the site is

242
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,079
fully functional um at the moment uh

243
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,560
we're working on essentially the

244
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,480
initiatives of the members there's no

245
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,000
community support

246
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,320
uh we found whatever activities uh i

247
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,640
needed ourselves at this time

248
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,760
and uh

249
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,200
we hope uh for the foundation support at

250
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,680
some point in the future alex i don't

251
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,959
know if you wanted to add something

252
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,360
briefly to what i said yes

253
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,839
i can add something uh

254
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,720
so

255
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,279
as you know

256
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,040
me is a part of the academy and

257
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,440
team of developers have an experience

258
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,720
especially in nft

259
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,519
we are currently developing

260
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,480
a little number of projects

261
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,120
in nft fair

262
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,720
and yes uh after discussion with

263
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,880
academic members we have this wonderful

264
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,519
idea idea uh

265
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,640
by the way

266
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,839
uh

267
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,600
this website

268
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,839
is

269
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,880
this website doesn't use any

270
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,320
uh content management system it's fully

271
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,760
uh made with react and

272
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,560
typescript and so on

273
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,399
and we have yes we have this wonderful

274
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,480
idea that courses can be an nft and

275
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,480
users can pay for this nft

276
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,800
and buy access to the course

277
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,959
all the user can

278
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,640
uh mean

279
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,720
or users can enroll some courses and uh

280
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,560
then mean uh

281
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,920
certificates

282
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,160
uh as uh previously we have some core uh

283
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,560
which we can integrate with the academy

284
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,560
so we have done this now and now yes

285
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,959
when development process to

286
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,839
to finish

287
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,480
some updates according to academy

288
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,880
specific like uh certificates and so on

289
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,760
um that's why

290
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,480
yep

291
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,000
we are in progress

292
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,440
thank you i think i think that's all yes

293
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,639
and back to you joe

294
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,800
okay great uh yeah so rebranding yes

295
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,120
we're no stranger to rebranding and

296
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,160
that's

297
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,839
it's not an easy thing to do but

298
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,680
congrats to you guys on that the website

299
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,320
looks really cool um the idea for nft

300
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,079
courses is also

301
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,040
awesome so i'm uh wondering

302
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,440
do you have like a kind of a referral

303
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,880
program in place are you building

304
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,320
something like that are you going to do

305
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,399
something with royalties and maybe

306
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,040
people can earn points and redeem for

307
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,560
forever courses

308
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,519
yes

309
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,360
thank you yes

310
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,040
thank you for asking that let me start

311
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,560
alex on you

312
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,040
basically the in addition to doing a

313
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,839
brand new website the the academy now is

314
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,519
in the process of developing its

315
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,200
economics

316
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,720
which will be based on a number of

317
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,800
interesting concepts such as a

318
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,600
reputation of uh teachers such as the

319
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,760
reputation of students

320
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,160
um such as teamwork

321
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,880
and uh rewarding people for

322
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,200
bringing useful uh

323
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
members to the team and a number of

324
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,639
other initiatives uh that is yet to come

325
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,760
um including some very advanced concepts

326
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,920
that frankly we looked up

327
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,600
in some of the other

328
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,160
friendly partner

329
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,639
initiatives in the educational space

330
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,519
alex you wanted to add something

331
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,079
um

332
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,279
joe asked about as i understand your

333
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,480
asked about the reference system

334
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,959
i guess we will think about this too

335
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,959
because we have

336
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,000
we have already uh as you know uh have

337
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,760
an experience with uh creating a

338
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,480
referral system for marketplaces

339
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,240
and maybe we will take this idea and

340
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,760
rebuild it according to academy model

341
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,560
data and so on but

342
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,560
yes we can do it for sure because we

343
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,880
have already did it

344
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,839
but

345
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,040
how will we do this for academy maybe it

346
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,839
will be referral system only for

347
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,399
teachers maybe on the for students i

348
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,680
think that we will discuss uh later

349
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,760
yes thank you

350
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,440
okay great

351
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,800
well that's very interesting and

352
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,480
definitely look forward to that when you

353
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,720
guys can share more information there um

354
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,560
and looking forward to when the website

355
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,600
is also

356
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,880
functional

357
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,240
that's cool too

358
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,760
yep we'll be back to report on that yeah

359
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,880
great

360
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,480
okay so

361
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,880
next up on the agenda is the everscale

362
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
white paper of deutsche

363
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,120
so we have a familiar face in the

364
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,600
community who spent a good chunk of her

365
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,240
time translating the entirety of the

366
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,440
everscale whitepaper into german so

367
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,560

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,040
different countries during my travels i

378
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,800
learned way more than i could ever learn

379
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,040
in any school i worked for social media

380
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,880
company and studied economics and

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,160
physics

382
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,839
the first time blockchain caught my

383
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,160
attention was back in 2014

384
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,480
when my former classmates

385
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,839
brought it up

386
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,720
and

387
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,120
discussed the topic of bitcoin and its

388
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,680
use in gaming industry since then my

389
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,920
interest in bitcoin grew and eventually

390
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,399
i became an investor myself and started

391
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,440
trading

392
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
and i have to mention thanks to bitcoin

393
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,160
covered 19 pandemic and its lockdown

394
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,639
weren't that bad however due to two

395
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,560
years in lockdown and it's many

396
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,600
economical and

397
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
social social consequences i decided to

398
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,560
leave europe and settled on mexico

399
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
since blockchain saved my life once

400
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,920
already i

401
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,160
as a resource of income i decided to

402
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,440
dedicate

403
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,600
more of my time to it not long after

404
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,480
arriving in tulum a local crypto club

405
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,240
caught my attention and this beautiful

406
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,199
life can be it happened eugene morozov

407
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,519
was a speaker that day it didn't took

408
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,759
long to figure he was the most competent

409
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,079
speaker that day and it turned out to be

410
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,839
true as well

411
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,320
um so that's also how my story with

412
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,360
everscale began we exchanged context and

413
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,160
i became a student and one of my first

414
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,480
tasks was of course to read every scale

415
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,079
white paper and since i'm a native

416
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,320
german speaker i naturally translated

417
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,759
technical language to make sure i

418
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,440
understand it myself

419
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,320
so while i was at it why not translate

420
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,079
it all

421
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,160
so then i also learned quickly meteor

422
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,480
approach differs a lot from any other

423
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,559
white paper i've read before

424
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,319
among many concepts that caught my

425
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,480
attention was web free

426
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,559
and the impact it will have on our

427
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,160
economy

428
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,720
democracy and society

429
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,640
overall i was very impressed by the

430
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,119
technology media described and its

431
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,679
implementation by your community that

432
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,520
built the network

433
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,440
on the translation itself

434
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,919
from a technical translation perspective

435
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,720
this work presented a few challenges

436
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,240
for example

437
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,320
i was confronted with many terms that

438
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,799
couldn't be translated to german easily

439
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,080
or not at all

440
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,160
i had to adapt and decided to keep

441
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,559
english originals or to conjugate them

442
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,080
when needed

443
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,080
additionally i decided not to translate

444
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,160
quotients to stay closer to the original

445
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,320
meaning and i'm convinced my german

446
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,160
fellows are well enough educated to

447
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,600
understand them

448
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,520
i had to change a few remaining mentions

449
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,000
of tom to ever except when mentioned in

450
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,679
historical context

451
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,440
during the whole process of a little

452
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,760
over four months i learned more and more

453
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,280
about every scale

454
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,200
network and figured there are little to

455
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,600
non-german speakers which surprised me

456
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,919
and has to be changed

457
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,080
so the concept of learning through white

458
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,400
paper translation changed and i decided

459
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,600
to use the translation to popularize

460
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,679
everscale technology among german

461
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,240
speakers which by some estimates are

462
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,520
around 150 to 7 170 million

463
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,039
next i intend to build the

464
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,760
german-speaking average scale community

465
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,679
starting in zurich switzerland where i

466
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,080
lived the past three years i plan to

467
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,039
bring in my classmate olynyon who is a

468
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,120
best-selling german author as a writer

469
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,640
and content creator

470
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640

more

476
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,640
another step is spreading the word
