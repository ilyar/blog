okay mika welcome and the first question

is why wasn't it possible to create a

git on chain before why it wasn't

possible to put an existing git on a

blockchain for on ever scale or some

other blockchain why we decided to

create a totally new brand new

blockchain for kit

yeah it's a it's this the answer is like

has to there are two answers for that uh

one is technical which i don't want to

go right now into because we have a show

about economics

uh so let's talk about

the other

reason

and this reason is into economics

so as you as you all know

anything you do on any blockchain

costs some money

yeah sometimes called fees or gas

whatever

and

there is no model today

um

like no economic model today on the

blockchain

which permits you to do something for

free

you always pay for anything you do

and the reason why you pay

um is partly

um

protection against spam so

because if if you would start um

you know producing millions of

transactions for free

then you would stop a blockchain

you could stop a blockchain because

there is no unlimited capacity on any

blockchain and and any computing system

so sometimes uh what other projects

trying to do is for example solana

just just they make the fees very very

small

like

so small

that it's almost like you don't almost

no don't feel it

the problem there are two problems for

that first it's still

a fee so you still has have to buy right

tokens even if it's a small amount of

tokens

yeah you still need to buy it so it's

not free even if it's so it's small

small

um

but the other the other thing is that

it doesn't protect against spam

and we saw that solana

experienced many problems related to

this

where the full capacity was used it

doesn't matter if you if you don't have

unlimited capacity basically there is

some limit there is some price that

someone can pay to buy out

the whole blockchain basically which

means the blockchain will exclusively

work for this

someone and that means that the

blockchain will stop for everyone else

so

i think one of the most important the

contributions to tokenomics

in gosh is that

we came out

came up with the possibility to make a

completely free service on the

blockchain

and right because

again

a sorry to interrupt you because a git

for those who don't maybe so those who

don't know here uh a git is a free

service developers using git it's a free

service so

for open source yeah put

yeah for open source it's okay well

okay so git is not a service git is

something you install on your computer

where you basically store your code and

all the versions of your code

right

when you talk about service you talk

something like github or gitlab or

bitbucket whatever there are like right

a git hosting platform exactly so when

we talk about git costing platform yeah

and these platforms it doesn't it's not

only relates to git

it relates to any um well most of the

business models today when you have

cloud service usually this cloud service

provides you some um some

service for free it's like like initial

some amount of

whatever service they they give they

provided for free so for example like

firebase

or

you know aws you could you could have

like a small server from aws

for free just to try it out

just to build your application to test

your application and then

when you scale like when you have a lot

of users you start to have a lot of

users

then

you know you start paying and this is a

normal business model which which makes

it very easy to start developing on this

cloud service this model is used

everywhere right

so when you want to build a

blockchain based

service a cloud service for git

you must accommodate this you must

accommodate the developers who just want

to start for free

okay mita um let's see the your the

scheme of the tokenomics of gosh like

and you can describe briefly for us like

uh how it works like and then we're

gonna

uh go deeper and see like the details

sure well

as you said there are like two tokens

uh in in in gosh system uh one token is

stable coin and another token is like

value capturing token so the stable coin

called shell

and the

the value capturing token

called gosh

so

there is a reason why

um

why there are two tokens

and again

i don't want to go deeper into that a

lot

but just a couple of words yeah it's

impossible can you briefly cover yeah

yeah it's impossible to

to have one token which both captures

value

and has a property of

money which is like used to

pay for things

okay why it is important why it is not

possible is because

when you pay for stuff

you don't want

i would say this you would be

like inclined not to pay

if with something that rises in value

all the time right if for example if the

dollar

would

rise in value instead of falling like it

will if it would be just complete

deflation all the time instead of

inflation you would have deflation like

10 a year deflation think about that so

you know that what your dollar that you

can buy a coffee today tomorrow you can

buy two two cups of coffee

that would prevent people

psychologically from spending that

dollar

right because like who would spend

dollars if it's always rises in value

so that's why

inflation is actually

good for economic growth

as we know

it's exactly because of that that

stimulates

spending it stimulates people to get rid

of money to basically put money in

somewhere where the value is created for

example in enterprises take money is a

loan because what you take today and you

can use this loan to create your

business tomorrow you will pay less

when you repay the loan despite the fact

that it has

also percentage you know on the loan but

still you you can you easy you you take

the money and invest the money

easier in something in property for

example also just for whatever you

believe it will will rise in there right

right

right in bitcoin

well that's exactly what's happening

right people investing money

for example something that will rise in

value so people believe something will

rise in value so bitcoin people believe

will rise in value sometimes and they

they buy bitcoin with dollar they

exchange well sometimes

sometimes they don't they lose

believe in everything when the economic

downturn they don't believe but it it

corrects the moment right

right but it corrects itself it corrects

itself also if you look at the like

bitcoin price

it's still 20 000 per bitcoin not

what it was two years ago remember two

years ago it was like much less

right so still despite the fact okay it

went to 60 whatever and then at fall

doesn't matter it's still the basic

value rises

despite the fact that a lot of growing

yeah a lot of people sell it but because

but because well a lot of people will

sell because they feel pressure for

example they have some position

which which they need to cover for

example and they they oblige to sell

this bitcoin

because whatever but

okay

all right point is the point is we we

need to have two tokens if we want

one talking to ryzen value and we want

also to have token with with which

people would be like ready to pay

each other for work or for some services

and that token need to be

stable and actually if you remember

facebook

tried to do their own cryptocurrency

like this cryptocurrency was supposed to

be stable coin

right

and the reason for that is this nothing

but nothing is stable right

it's even the table is relative term

stable is relative to term actually it's

not stable it's losing value it should

lose the value in the perception people

should perceive that as losing value so

for example we know one thing that for

certain will lose value it's called

dollar

dollar is a great

losing value mechanism

and uh and so if you tight your

stablecoin to the dollar

term then

kind of we know that it will lose value

okay

so you need one uh one token to increase

in value so people are going to be

holding it basically right and the other

one who that they will be using for the

transaction so that's they will they

will use the brushes as well i can okay

so let's talk about how they can use

gold let's talk about uh tokens

yeah that's right so why do we need

gauche we already have stable coin and

the we need gosh for governance

and governance

is

when

you can

like vote

for things you can influence things by

just holding kosh

so when we say

uh holding like

you kind of have a part this is the

the mechanism

or the the unit of account

for

what your portion

like personally

that you hold in gosh project

is it kind of uh like a stakeholding uh

it is a state

exactly it is a stakeholding

it is it is it is a stakeholding in

gauche project and the stakeholding

it has several implications

one of them is that it is a mechanism

for

voting for whatever decisions someone

need to make

within the system

for gosh for example so for example

let's say the gosh is run by some

software and we want to change that

software we want to release some

upgrades some update or whatever

and who is going to decide if we're

releasing this update or not

people developers

yeah developers and investors or whoever

hold the stakeholders who hold gosh they

are the one that the most affected by

the decisions that the gosh as a network

as a project takes

and so they need to have an influence

over this decision and the influence is

measured by the amount of tokens they

hold

the thing is that

in order to encourage the holding

because when we talk about stablecoin we

encourage the spending when we talk

about governance tokens we encourage the

holding this in order to encourage the

whole thing you need this do you need

the value of the talk and not to fall at

least

and for it not to fall it should

actually rise

we know that so it's like an alice in

the wonderland remember i need to run

just to be in place so

uh

it need to rise and in order for it to

rise there is only one mechanism

that

because the price is is it is a demand

is a curve between demand and supply so

if we have some demand for talking the

only reason it will rise in value if you

have a demand is that the supply will be

limited it will be less than the demand

so that will rise that something will

rise and value like in bitcoin

you have you know in existence like 21

million bitcoin will will ever be

more or less mined and that means that

the demand for bitcoin supposedly to be

rising over time

because more and more people would like

to hold it so the same thing with gosh

the more platform is used the more

developers are joining the more they

would like to hold part of the system so

they can influence the decisions over

the system because this is the system

with their project leaves on and so

for that we need that to rise right

that's very interesting so you're

speaking about people uh you're speaking

about investors who are gonna be uh

whole like who are gonna have

stakeholders speaking about validator

stakeholders

yeah

call them yes whoever you want but it's

interesting because we're now coming to

the validators

program on gosh

so i just uh wanted to ask you a

question that came up to me so

validators are going to be same

stakeholders uh is it correct

correct right

well yeah in order in order to in order

to validate you need to stake

um

that's how it works like always

yeah in any proof of statement

as well

you need to stake you need to hold on to

token because this is the security

guarantee

that you give to the network that if you

as a validator you will do something

malicious then

um you will lose your tokens

so yeah

right okay so now now that we came to

validators uh program i um

i looked into ghost economics so i saw

that basically validators program it's

quite different from what we are usually

used to on other blockchains and that

validators has some advantages and one

of those you just mentioned right that

uh basically the daters get the ability

to choose on uh on gosh decisions like

to make decisions upon gosh right

because they're gonna have uh

basically okay not not not so quickly

let's let's separate this so first okay

so first let's talk about validation how

you can become a validator validation

program so you need to have gosh okay

you need to put it as a stake and you

need to lock it for

from one to five years

like one two three four four five

um and each the longer you

you

like stake it

the more

like percentage per year

revenue you will get market starts from

eight percent yeah eight percent first

year up to 24 yearly early return

uh like yield

uh if you if you look at for five years

right so

this is different in a way that it

combines

how the usual like d5 protocols work

with the proof of stake because usually

proof of stake

it's it's simpler than that you just you

know you call you you lock tokens in

steak you stay tokens

and then for the whatever period you

want and then you can exit at any time

right

and uh but but this is um

this model is just just basic proof of

proof-of-stake model but we we didn't

want to do that

because

um

we wanted we wanted to tighter to make

it tighter

the

uh what happens afterwards what you can

do with the token

um

not only just take it and then and then

just take it whenever you whenever you

want because we wanted you to

usually when validators take the token

that's the end of their involvement in

the network because they're only waiting

for yield right they can just take it

and then like they get their advantages

and basically

get the yield whatever it is and yeah

they get them yeah get the money no

advantages i guess i i mean they get

their

money basically essentially money is

advantageous

yeah money is a great advice for them

for sure

yes

absolutely but here uh but on gosh as i

understand that we will get it uh we'll

get a little later on it uh validators

have the ability to stay much longer

than five years if they wish to because

they have

other interesting

features

yeah i think the most important part

here sorry pauline go ahead

i'm sorry like you speak and i will this

is going to be my next question so you

can like talk more about it

all right so um

the thing is that um there is a there is

a one

covet here

we said

the biggest problem okay is that how you

you need to provide

yield right you need to provide you need

to

issue more tokens for validators to stay

on the network

usually right

you know in any network doesn't matter

proof of stake proof of work right now

validators are validators or miners

they constantly mine and despite the

fact that every four years

the the

mining rewards on on bitcoin for example

halves

the rise of the price make it up

and they still want to mine the next

bitcoin

right it's still economically economical

for them to mine next bitcoin but we

said in the beforehand that we need to

stop the emission

nobody is saying this actually like no

layer one protocol has ever i think said

uh this is the first time that someone

said we will just completely stop the

emission

because in bitcoin how it works they're

like half in like uh

every time like the next bitcoin is like

they get less money like twice less

money than before right that's how it

works but not completely stopped yet

well it will stop it will stop so

but satoshi well it's actually

okay

almost up let's say no no it's it will

stop completely because there will be

point where to my next bitcoin you will

never like you will never mind next

bitcoin it will take you until the end

of the universe to solve the next bus

but

that's okay so so satoshi

what satoshi predicted

um is that on certain day when the

mining will diminish it will be replaced

by

by the fees that someone pays for

transaction fees

okay

so it will be

replaced by transaction fees that the

miner will get

right and that will constitute their

revenue

uh

f from the point where there is there

are no more bitcoins mine

the reason actually mining was even

created in the beginning by satoshi

invented by satoshi's to

simplify the the miners to start the

network to continue support the network

before the level of transaction reaches

a certain point where it no longer will

be necessary to to have that

uh the mining

right

uh in gosh we are trying to compress

that first of all to five years

we will only

issue this amount of tokens

as we said and the amount of tokens

actually locked there are no more than

11 million tokens that will ever be

issued to validators

right yes we forgot to discuss about it

we didn't discuss it yet okay so yes

eleven millions goes to validate i'm not

not talking more so

i i i

might

my question was like okay they like um

lock these tokens for five years

what's next like after five years there

is no like interest in this anymore so

what how are you gonna keep them on uh

of course all right so that's liquidity

providing so we're kind of mixing here a

lot of d5 protocols and um yeah

so so so we're saying the following so

when you stake gosh in validator pool

you can issue for every state gauche you

can issue a token called lv gosh

and you can do two things with lv gosh

you can either

either sorry um

you can either

a vote with this

like participate in governance

or

or you can

provide liquidity

in the decentralized exchange

which is part of the system called gex

and this liquidity is used to support

actually repositories on gosh

which

open source projects or whatever

projects uh build their software on gosh

and they can

list the tokens of their repositories

in the gex repository and the gex uh

decentralized exchange so when you when

when so you can take your staked

token and you can provide liquidity

for different projects

uh with a separate mechanism which i

don't know if we discussed today

but this mechanism allows you like

allows every validator whoever you don't

need to be a validator but you need to

stake your gosh

and get this lv gosh tokens

to provide liquidity for this project

and when you provide liquidity you mine

the project tokens so instead of

transaction fees

so

so you basically become an investor

please you are an investor already

when when you invest in when you're

buying a mining farm in bitcoin you're

becoming an investor in bitcoin period

there's no question about it right you

and and the cost of the mining farm is

huge

as you know right so you invest up front

up front

um enormous amount of money

and you cannot sell it that easily

actually right it takes time and effort

to sell the equipment if you want to

exit

and so in a way when bitcoin

miner

kind of mined bitcoin

he staked

his money into bitcoin mining equipment

right improv in proof of stake you just

take that money without buying it equip

like

you have some servers but this is

negligible cost

right so right okay you need to you need

but but but you still it's still you're

still an investor you're an investor in

bitcoin or you invest in proof of stake

as a proof of state validator you still

investor but the question is not if you

invest or not the question is how you

make money on this investment

and if you think about that

just make a mission

it it doesn't make a lot of sense

actually

like like ethereum works on just

providing a mission like

emitting tokens every year to to

validators right

uh

to to you know for them to and ethereum

by the way will never stop there is no

such thing as as diminishing

mining rewards in ethereum so it's like

constant or whatever

and uh

this

this doesn't make a lot of sense because

um

okay you introduce inflation into the

system which you want to be deflationary

as we said before you need two tokens

remnants

so it's it's it's a mixed up thing and i

don't think it works actually

like the only thing why it works is

because when you have certain amount of

tokens you participate in kind of having

um

transaction fees as well right and that

gives you

this economical that gives it some

economical sense

but we said here we wanted to let's just

eliminate let's eliminate the mining

that's eliminating the emission

and then let's eliminate the fees for a

second let's just eliminate the fees

from the from the whole equation

now what happens then well if you stake

you're talking if you believe that you

you start to earn some then yield you

believe in the platform you believe in

the gosh price right if you're investor

you believe in gosh price

so you lock the stock in validation give

you a boost we call it staking boost for

five years

11 million tokens

but

then if you want to continue support the

network you actually need to what is the

network what is the value of the network

the value of the network is actually we

believe the value of the of the projects

using this network

all right if you get if your kit on

chain the value of git on chain is in

the projects in the open source

repositories or closed source

repositories which are using this giton

chain for different reasons which we're

not going to discuss today why why they

would use it but

that's not the point okay so if you

believe that people will use this

and or people are using this you can see

that and then

you want to capitalize on them so they

how you capitalize on them

you can take the fees from their

transaction that would usually

doing everyone doing right

but we're saying

right but we're saying

actually

own

part of this project you can own part of

the projects without actually going to

fees you don't need their fees you can

actually own their tokens

and so if the project want to

list their

tokens basically listing means

give it to the hands of investors

so if the project is interested in

getting the they're talking

to the to the hands of investors they

can do that by listing that on gex and

you as an investor validator whatever

you call yourself

you can take your staked tokens

and use it to provide liquidity

basically as a and as a reward for

providing liquidity you get

pieces of the tokens of this

repositories

right

does it make sense

yeah very interesting

so uh

so projects uh i'm just gonna mention it

briefly so basically projects will have

an opportunity to

receive fundings right open source

projects with gosh to economics

they have an ability

it's not only it's it's

not just

it it's not just to receive funding is a

very generalized term because

right you don't necessarily receive

funding okay you can list your talking

tokens

and just

find some buyers even without you

receiving funding directly

so because you just want to you you may

want just to promote a trade of your

token

and so people

that

believe in your projects can participate

by by buying some projects maybe even

not from you

it's like what you do with ipo right so

there is initial public offering where

you sell your talking to investors but

you can list it just without selling it

to investors directly and you just just

can allow everyone who has the token to

list it and then the investors can buy

from them

you not necessarily need to issue tokens

new tokens to

to to investors there is there are

myriads of way to do that

just

so we allow that listing decentralized

listing of any repository who wishes and

when you create actually when you create

repository on gosh

that the dao

which governed by the token of risk repo

this repository create created uh just

by default

of course you don't need to use this

tokens to sell it or use it as a as a as

a

financial instrument right

but does any token uh so you said a

repository created the organization uh

by itself automatically does any token

that is going to be issued will end up

on gex on the decentralized exchange

can end up okay what are the criteria

just in few words

there are it's basically just what you

want so you as a repository

uh

owner

owner means

your repository is owned by the token

holders of your repository this is the

whole point that's a repository dial so

you as a dao

all token holders

can decide that you want this token be

available on the ax that someone can

sell and buy and sell these tokens of

your repository if you decided this you

vote for this if you decide it's just a

commit and git

uh

okay so just a comment it doesn't

it's just a commit so it's uh it's

actually yeah you just you just create

that commit

there is a metric one metric is it

should be f dao

so

okay

f dao means

a fair dial protocol

and that

we have a slide for that i think

so far protocol is is very simple

protocol it basically says that

all the revenues

that the token captures doesn't matter

whatever revenues there are

and again

if you are an open source repository

let's say and you

have some revenue generated on chain for

example you sell some services around

your repository or something

right um and you sell it

on gosh

and we will discuss i can we will

discuss later when we discuss shell

how you can actually sell it like you

sell today

your services via whatever credit card

so

let's say you sell some services on

on gosh

and

this this

the payment

uh

which is the payment in token

in any token can be shell it can be

anything else

should arrive into some smart contract

which is called efdow reserve

and the efda reserve

it the only way to get this talking out

of the reserve is to sell

some

tokens of your repository some your dow

tokens your project dial tokens

towards this reserve

right so we burn

to burn yeah you burn tokens in the

reserve in exchange you get the

proportional amount of the whatever

accumulated revenues there is in this

contract

this is very interesting dynamic

which basically provides the constantly

rising

if you continue if a repository continue

to sell some services it will constantly

the the reserve

uh

the amount of tokens in reserve the

value in reserve will constantly rise

and because it will never fall because

when you burn tokens so proportionally

to every token it will rise doesn't

matter if you sell

if someone sells or not

right very interesting so so all the

liquidity is going to be uh so basically

everything um backs it's let's say it's

the it's the heart rates that doesn't

realize that change all the tokens are

going to be listed there

you can decide

not all of them

if you're talking as follows the revenue

model of fair dao then you're

automatically

like in enables listing and the only

thing that the only thing that you need

to do

to list apart from ref dao is to have

certain amount of liquidity

and that's exactly so you basically

create commit

in the gex repository

with your talking listing

and the the repository will check

automatically if that's fare down

and if it's fair now it will immediately

create a notification to all lv gosh

talking holders that you can

actually vote for it will start a voting

period

for this

uh you know talking holder salvy gorsh

talking holes to vote for providing

liquidity or not and if they pass the

threshold of this liquidity then it the

token will automatically list my

curiosity everything is going to be

already automatically so if we see that

the project repository

is having a

fair doubt they're having

they're getting uh

things done they're they're selling

right they're selling their service

so automatically as you said all the

holder of the lb gosh token will be

notified so it's everything is going to

be in the system built in already

so it's yeah because because the lv the

lv gosh talk and holders

they have notification they are

automatically subscribed to the

notification of the gosh repository and

gex repository

so

when when the gex

submits the project it commits its

project basically to gex repository

and

uh when it when it's done then everyone

the voting starts automatically

okay interesting so the voting through

soft cooperative voting mechanism right

that we

yeah we will not discuss it today but um

so we can discuss it we can discuss it

very briefly

we can go yes please self-copy rating

voting is is a special mechanism

where every token holder vote for the

project

but um they participate proportionally

to their holding so if it passes

threshold then everyone will commit

the percentage of their holding

into the amount that was voted for

so

if you have if if the if the suv

uh voting was for i don't know

providing liquidity

in the range of hundred thousand for

example

uh gosh tokens actually shells because

that's the pair is shell against uh

against the project talking in this

hundred thousand shells and you have a

hundred thousand participants

which which you know has i don't know

equal amount of tokens they will all

contribute one token

one gosh

sorry one shell

two

to the to the liquidity pair

doesn't matter if some of them voted or

not if the decision collective decision

was such that we allow that

and the collective decision reached the

threshold of hundred thousand for

example tokens then everyone will

automatically commit their token

proportional token holding into this

liquidity

did you decide to make this a particular

model uh what are the benefits because

because this is the model which allows

for

a

decentralized cooperation

uh where not every participant need to

participate

because it it provides its answers the

question how much

it's it's a quantitative decision you

can today there are no

sorry

um

today

there is no voting mechanism

you can vote yes or no you can reach

some decision yes or no but

you cannot reach decision how much

the quantitative decision there is no

mechanism we know

that can reach quantitative decision and

soft cooperative voting it's based on

the work that i did with unrelation

uh

that um

that is providing the answer to the

question how much so if we want to

decide we're a fund

we okay so we want to invest we can

easily create a voting and and say okay

do we want to invest in this project

right but then we need to ask how much

we want to invest in this project so we

can of course ask the question do we

want to invest one million in this

project but let's say what about one

million and five

so do we need additional voting to to

ask a question do we want to invest one

million and five

and so on and so on so it's it's

basically just there was no mechanism

right to exactly answer the question how

much the sm suv

protocol allows us to

not only vote for do we want to invest

but also do we how how much do we want

to invest

that's easy soft cup rating food and

guess what is for quantitative decisions

on how much how how many and so on and

so forth when we don't know

when we have some quantity of something

we don't know what is the quantity that

we want to provide

so if majority voting is for binary

decisions yes or no but

with it with it with a twist

it it solves for

um participation problem we know that

suv also sort of soft say

solves for participation problem

because again in both of them are

solving for participation problem for

different uh

so what is the problem of participation

a lot of people just don't want to vote

they never vote

on anything they're passive and we know

that like

the turnaround of any voting any public

voting is very low as we know and the

the more stable the economy the the less

people participate right we know that

problem

so in soft majority voting

there is a mechanism which allows

to reach if there is a majority like

overwhelming majority

of 10 percent of votes

let's say if 10 of votes

everyone says yes then we just say if

the decision is reached

okay so ten percent participated there

is a tragic right

there it's moving threshold so ten

percent participated ninety percent

didn't participate but ten percent

said yes all of them

it's it's a yes but if one vote

said no

then

we need to wait for more votes

and

right and it self-regulates itself until

it reaches if there is for every yes

vote there is a no vote then we have a

problem here right we cannot decide

there is no majority super majority

then

we need to

basically this will the threshold will

go will rise to 50

and then the 51 percent will decide

like a normal voting but that's not what

usually happens what usually happens is

usually like decision is overwhelmingly

supported or overwhelmingly

not supported

so if there is

uh overwhelming support we don't need to

wait for 51 to reach that decision

because statistically actually it is

almost impossible that 10 of votes said

yes no one said no

but if we will continue voting

there will be like suddenly majority

that will say no it will change just

that's that won't happen okay

so that's the mechanism this mechanism

allows for active participants if they

agree to reach the decision faster

without waiting for everyone else if

they don't disagree then they still will

need to for everyone else to vote until

the point where if it's 50 50 by the end

then the one will will decide

the last low

very interesting so so we are talking

about some majority vote uh voting so

basically soft majority voting uh who

will vote i'm just uh

[Music]

smv

for the decisions of the governance of

the gosh repository the gauche network

or

you can stake it and provide liquidity

with that

on a cv so there is just one or another

no you can undo both

okay so each dow repository

has its own token which voting mechanism

do we use here

smb like like you do on gosh so it's

it's everything is the same every

repository by default of course i mean

you can create your own

whatever

or token if you want but

by default uh when repository spawned

you you it creates dao with the tokens

and the token mechanism voting mechanism

is s smd like like you have on gosh

repository same thing

so everyone votes for the smb it's the

most convenient way

because again not everyone needs to

vote

okay

okay so um

coming back to validators as we know

that

they don't get the transaction fees so

where these transaction fees are

actually going

okay

so transactions fees

are paid in shell

so the the the actual

so the actual basic token of the network

is shell talking and obviously

the reason why is because we want people

to

uh you know to make more transactions

into so we want to encourage the

the payment of the gas fees and for that

as we said before we need this token to

lose value not to raise

so that's why we use shell for this

okay so

everyone who wants to

use

gosh

if they pay they will pay in shell for

transaction fees

but as we said in the beginning

we want to allow some free

usage

of the repository

so every every token is

every repository has its own token smb

smv mechanism was used for governance of

this repository then we talked about

shell token and the transaction fees

transaction fees

are paid in shell because we want to

encourage people to transact more and

for that we want the token that they pay

for transaction fees to lose value and

that is show

um but we also want people not to pay

fees

so how do we do that

because remember we started from this

and we went full cycle now

so we need to protect against spam

remember right

and

this was unsolvable up until now

we created something called

free service area and the free service

area

is

the area where if the smart contract is

placed in this area

this smart contract

uh can transact

with in other smart contracts in the

free service area only

for free without fees

now there are limits to this

like in every

think of like

in in aws

the

the server that you buy for free

you take for free you start for free has

limits

you cannot scale to a million customers

in in fire base you have some limits on

how many queries you can you know make

or writes you can do to the database

so we will have the same limits

so basically you have some limits that

these contracts are operating on

beyond that limits you need to pay fees

yeah to use the service which is i think

exactly what what is expected from such

service

but before that limit

you can spend as much you want and you

can create as many accounts free

accounts as you want of course

like

um

and but you cannot extract the value out

of it

basically

if you just create these accounts to

um

you cannot game the system meaning that

you won't be able to

take out the value that is provided in

the free service area

out to your wallet and benefit from it

so this is this is the idea

and then and and but it also exactly

well fortunately unfortunately

yeah but there is one

more benefit

in having the free service area enabled

and this is a very interesting one

because you cannot transit you cannot

extract because you cannot extract value

out of these tokens in free service area

these tokens immediately become

completely utility token

like just think about that

there is no speculation here

in this area so when this token is

within this area

it actually pure utility token

and as a pure utility token it can be

used solely

as the unit of account

right

it it doesn't it does it it doesn't

store value

and it doesn't use it used as a as a

is a value exchange

so it's not a payment system anymore and

it's not an investment system anymore

it's just a unit of account

now the unit of account

allows you

to actually

transact with

the

fiat world

because remember in fiat world like if

you want to

transact with dollars

you

cannot have

the speculative part

which is the investment part and you

cannot have

the like payment part the money part

because then if you have them then the

regulator

will tell you wait wait this is

cryptocurrency

and if you have a cryptocurrency in

order to connect the cryptocurrency with

the fiat world you will need to pass

through the whole

bananza

of

right of the aml kyc what not

which makes it absolutely impossible

basically to use it

if you are not a financial institution

but

if we take that out

we can say it's a utility token meaning

it is not cryptocurrency anymore

when the token passed to this area

it becomes utility token not

cryptocurrency and that allows it to

immediately be connected to any payment

gateway and you don't need any kyc ml

so if you want to take money

from your customers in a normal way

through like accepting for example uh

you know credit card debit card

you can immediately do that

and we actually have the payment gateway

built into the free service area so if

you want to collect money for your

repository like for example

i don't know donations or or anything

like that for for the someone to use

that uses your repository or you want to

you know your customers to pay for

services that you provide

you can issue invoices and get the

payments through this payment gateway to

the um to the free service area

well it's quite convenient then you

don't have to

buy like um you don't have to do that

extra

uh thing like to buy like uh

tokens to pay and so on so yeah exactly

just that directly use your credit card

exactly and you don't know it doesn't

matter how much you pay and you don't

need to aml kyc services

and also that's something that's already

been structured into so i mean

developers usually do pay with their

credit cards if it's uh

for example it's it's

their business let's say credit card

right so quite convenient yeah

shall we sum up shall we open up the

whole scheme of tokenomics if you can

show it on your screen and just go

briefly

you can

but we will see it anyway yeah

yeah i i don't have actually this camera

because it's it's really big it's

actually if you take all everything that

we you can see probably on your screen

now if you if you can take everything we

discussed today all the pieces of this

stock economics it's quite complex

picture but if you take it one by one

right it's it's a it's a subsystems of

the whole system

which make kind of a total

closed system

of the subsystems but each of the

subsystems make sense i think

in each other

different purpose like an engine

right so very interesting

i think what we didn't discuss actually

today is only one thing and that's the

numbers

i think that maybe right yeah so i can

go over this very quickly so the total

supply of wash tokens

is 100 million

okay total amount

ever be minted

and

it may go lower than that actually if

for example for some reason like

some some validators will will be less

validators within this five years i

don't know why but

theoretically it could go down because

it's always up to a certain number

so

then there is like

67 million of these gosh tokens will go

to

towards the development of the network

and research

and of the gauche product at the whole

ecosystem

in general

and uh

of course

then 11 million as we said will go to

the um

boost boost

program

yeah and then of course there are some

some tokens that will go into in and be

sold to people who would like to provide

support for gore's project

um

you know and or validators that want to

validate or just people who want to

participate

right

well of course it will going to be

listed on the axes exactly the same

mechanism as was described today so gosh

is just another repository on gosh

because as such it has a dao and his

token in this token by the decision of

the dao which is not yet reached of

course but we will be able to whoever

has got tokens be able to vote for this

uh can be listed on gigs and then the

validators would be able to provide

liquidity

okay

so shall we discuss the pricing on gosh

maybe it's interesting as well for those

developers who are watching us today

well the pricing is is of course

something which with the prices

right now it's in the private kind of

round of financing and uh if the price

is around three dollars per token

currently

um it then if it will be listed then the

the price will be determined by the

by obviously by the market

it is important to mention that

the 67 million that i have said

when it goes to ecosystem development

and everything

it actually is not released

at any given moment

like even if it's issued to some

developers for example it will go

towards like a vesting scheme which is a

five years vesting skin

which will be released slowly so

the available tokens on the market will

be always like

thin and

the amount of this tokens will grow very

slowly over five years

so um

again

until the ecosystem balances

and it balances when

like we have remember that the last

stock invested

will be also the last token issued ever

and that

will balance the price because again we

want the token to rise in value because

it's a it's a value storing token and

because we want people to participate in

the ecosystem as we said before you need

to vote for the repositories you need to

provide liquidity so we need you to hold

this tokens

and in order to do that

obviously the token expectations of

price should be that it will capture

value over time so it will rise over

time and we and in order not to create

over supply on the market in on any

point even when we meet the talk and

then give the talking to developers for

their kind of participation ecosystem

for example if they commit their

committees accepted to the gosh

repository they get some tokens

and so but these tokens are still vested

over a long period of time five years

and uh and released you know

slowly

so this

just coming back to uh gosh in general

revenue

model is it a real

working revenue model so because as we

know

today on blockchain we do have probably

not even one project that has a real

uh revenue model let's say that

does give a service let's call it

we believe that gouache is the only

actually

real product on the blockchain on any

blockchain today because the rest of the

blockchain products are either either

token

sale icos

or um like the

defy

on the financial services on top of that

there are almost no use case

uh real use case for blockchain we

believe that gosh is the the largest use

case up to date

to the blockchain in general so as such

it does have you know intrinsic value

in in the in the token itself and the

prop because that has a product now in

terms of pricing for the gauche itself

for the gauche products it's very simple

um and we just follow again this

the business model of any cloud

uh git cloud providing for example right

so we have the free uh

free part of the service as we said like

the unlimited repositories the unlimited

users in this repositories the the dao

itself and so on the ci cd

basics for ci cd on on on gosh

and so on

and then

you have the

like subscription 15 a month

subscription which

includes

some services where for example you

store like store large files

like more than 10

gigabyte of storage in the in your

repository some advanced management

tools some some other other features

that you might want to use or you just

go over crazy over limit with the amount

of users

you have in in your repository for

writing like right right users

um

is it a competitive price

it is a competitive price it is exactly

right like any other yeah it is exactly

like any other

kit on git cloud

you know cost today gitlab or github

they all charge more or less the same

amount

i see great thank you

thank you

ghost thank you

yes

yes yeah and again let's let's let's

we're talking in other

time about why to choose gosh here yeah

stream is right and only about like

talking amongst how gosh works

economically

yeah we do have another questions

that we wanted to discuss for example

next time we can go through gosh

features for developers why what

projects

can come on gosh why

developers

likely want to choose gosh instead of

any other git hosting platform because

there are very interesting points that

makes gosh unique and

you know like

so we will have another stream on 24th

right with um some interest yeah

yes yeah

we do have a stream on twenty four we're

gonna talk more yeah about the

gosh itself

about gosh

yeah gosh product and gosh blockchain in

general today we covered tokenomics

thank you everybody for watching thank

you for joining us today so sorry thank

you
